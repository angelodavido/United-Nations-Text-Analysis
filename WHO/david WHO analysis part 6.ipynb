of\\nhuman rights (udhr, 1948). however, by the\\n\\ntime that states were prepared to turn the provi-\\n\\nsions of the declaration into binding law, the cold\\n\\nwar had overshadowed and polarised humanrights into two separate categories. the west\\n\\nargued that civil and political rights had priority\\n\\nand that economic and social rights were mere\\n\\naspirations. the eastern bloc argued to the con-\\n\\ntrary that rights to food, health and education\\nwere paramount and civil and political rights sec-\\n\\nondary. hence two separate treaties were created\\n\\nin 1966 œ the international covenant on economic,\\nsocial and cultural rights (icescr) and the inter-\\nnational covenant on civil and political rights\\n(iccpr). since then, numerous treaties, declara-\\n\\ntions and other legal instruments have been\\n\\nadopted, and it is these instruments that encapsu-\\n\\nlate human rights. section1: \\nhealth & human\\nrights norms \\nand

instruments. in\\n\\nrelation to the right to health and freedom from\\ndiscrimination, the normative content is out-\\nlined in questions 4 and 5, respectively. exam-\\n\\nples of the language used in human rights\\ninstruments to articulate the normative content\\n\\nof some of the other key human rights relevant\\n\\nto health follows: ł torture: \\nﬁno one shall be subjected to torture\\nor

from\\ndiscrimination relate\\n\\nto health?\\nvulnerable and marginalized groups in soci-\\neties tend to bear an undue proportion of health\\n\\nproblems. overt or implicit discrimination vio-\\n\\nlates a fundamental human rights principle and\\noften lies at the root of poor health status. in\\n\\npractice, discrimination can manifest itself in\\ninadequately targeted health programmes and\\n\\nrestricted access to health services.the prohibition of discrimination does not mean\\nthat differences should not be acknowledged,\\n\\nonly that different treatment œ and the failure to\\n\\ntreat equal cases equally œ must be based on\\n\\nobjective and reasonable criteria intended to \\n\\nrectify imbalances within a society. \\nin relation to health and health-care the grounds\\nfor non-discrimination have evolved and can\\nnow be summarized as proscribing ﬁany \\n\\ndiscrimination in access to health care and the\\n\\nunderlying determinants of health, as well as to\\n\\nmeans and entitlements for their procurement,\\n\\non the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, \\nreligion, political or other opinion, national orsocial origin, property, \\nbirth, physical or mentaldisability, health \\nstatus (including hiv/aids),sexual orientation, civil, political, social or\\nother status, which has the intention or effect of\\n\\nnullifying or impairing the equal enjoyment or\\nexercise of the right to health.ﬂ\\n(32) ﬁpublic health practice is heavily \\nburdened by the problem of inadvertent\\n\\ndiscrimination. for example,

poisoning\\n\\nwarnings are given without concern for\\n\\nfinancial ability to ensure lead abatement.\\n\\nindeed, inadvertent discrimination is so\\nprevalent that all public health policies\\n\\nand programmes should be considered \\n\\ndiscriminatory until proven otherwise,\\n\\nplacing the burden on public health to\\naffirm and ensure its respect for human\\n\\nrights.ﬂ

decision is made, however, there is a com-\\n\\nmitment to act in accordance with the provi-\\n\\nsions of the treaty concerned. the key interna-\\n\\ntional human rights treaties, the international\\n\\ncovenant on economic, social and cultural\\nrights (icescr, 1966) and the international\\ncovenant on civil and political rights (iccpr,\\n1966) further elaborate the content of the rights\\nset out in the universal declaration of human\\nrights (udhr, 1948), and contain legally bind-\\ning obligations for the governments that\\nbecome parties to them. together these docu-\\n\\nments are often called the ﬁinternational bill of\\n\\nhuman rights.ﬂbuilding upon these core documents, other\\ninternational human rights treaties have\\n\\nfocused on either specific groups or categories\\n\\nof populations, such as racial minorities,(34)women(35)and children,\\n(36)or on specific issues,such as torture.\\n(37)in considering a normativeframework of human rights

and to make them\\nwidely available to their own populations.\\nthus reports can play an important catalytic\\n\\nrole, contributing to the promotion of nation-\\nal debate on human rights issues,

human rights at certain times.public health is sometimes used by states as aground for limiting the exercise of human\\n\\nrights. akey factor in determining if the necessaryprotections exist when rights are restricted is\\n\\nthat each one of the five criterion of the siracusa\\nprinciples must be met. even in circumstances\\n\\nwhere limitations on grounds of protecting\\n\\npublic health are basically permitted, they\\n\\nshould be of limited duration and subject to\\nreview. \\ninterference with freedom of movement when\\ninstituting quarantine or isolation for a serious\\ncommunicable disease š for example, ebola\\nfever, syphilis, typhoid or untreated tuber-\\n\\nculosis š are examples of restrictions on rights\\n(52) see question 7.the siracusa principles\\nonly as a last resort can human rights be\\ninterfered with to achieve a public health\\n\\ngoal. such interference can only be justified\\n\\nwhen all of the narrowly defined circumstan-\\n\\nces set out in human rights law, known as the\\n\\nsiracusa principles, are met:\\n• the restriction is provided for and carried\\nout in accordance with the law;\\n• the restriction is in the interest of a legiti-\\nmate objective of general interest;\\n• the restriction is strictly necessary in a\\ndemocratic society to achieve the objective;\\n• there are no less intrusive and restrictive\\nmeans available to reach the same objective;\\n\\nand• the restriction is not drafted or imposed\\narbitrarily, i.e. in an unreasonable or other-\\n\\nwise discriminatory manner.\\n©whothat may, under certain circumstances, be nec-\\nessary for the public good, and therefore could\\n\\nbe considered legitimate under international\\n\\nhuman rights law.\\n(53)by contrast, a state whichrestricts the movements of, or incarcerates, per-\\nsons with hiv/aids, refuses to allow doctors\\n\\nto treat persons believed to be opposed to a\\n\\ngovernment or fails to provide immunization\\n\\nagainst the community™s major infectious \\ndiseases, on grounds such as national security or\\n\\nthe preservation of public order, has the burden\\n\\nof justifying such serious measures.\\n(54)q.14what \\nimplications\\ncould human rights\\n\\nhave for evidence-\\n\\nbased health\\n\\ninformation?\\nthe process that gives birth to an international-\\nly recognized human right is generated from\\n\\nthe pressing reality on the ground. for exam-\\n\\nple, the development of a declaration on the\\nrights of indigenous populations(55)stems from\\nthe recognition that this is a vulnerable and\\n\\nmarginalized population group lacking full\\n\\nenjoyment of a wide range of human rights,\\nincluding rights to political participation,\\nhealth and education. in other words, the estab-\\n\\nlishment of human rights norms and standards\\n\\nis itself evidence of a serious problem and gov-\\n\\nernmental recognition of the importance of\\n\\naddressing it. the existence of human rights\\n\\nnorms and standards should therefore stimulate \\nthe collection of evidence, indicating the dataneeded to tackle complex health challenges.\\nfor example, disaggregating data beyond tra-\\n\\nditional markers could detect discrimination\\non the basis of ethnicity against indigenous and\\ntribal peoples which is considered an underly-\\n\\ning determinant of their overall poor health sta-\\ntus. however, the political sensitivities which\\n\\nunderpin human rights in exposing how dif-\\nferent population groups are treated and why,\\n\\nhampers the extent to which human rights are\\n\\nwelcomed as a driving force for data collection. \\nmore widely accepted is the notion that human\\nrights are relevant to the way in which health\\n\\ndata should be collected. this includes the\\nchoice of the methods of data collection which\\nmust include considerations on how to ensure\\n\\nrespect for human rights, such as privacy, par-\\nticipation and non-discrimination. secondly,\\n\\ninternational instruments can be helpful in\\n\\ndefining various population groups. for exam-\\n\\nple, the ilo convention concerning indige-\\nnous and tribal peoples\\n(56)provides an authori-\\ntative basis for identifying and differentiating\\n\\nindigenous and tribal peoples from other \\n\\npopulation groups.\\n(55 the open-ended inter-\\nsessional working group\\n\\non the draft declaration\\n\\nwas established in 1995

relate\\nto human rights?\\nethics are norms of conduct for individuals and\\nfor societies. these norms derive from many\\n\\nsources, including religion, cultural tradition,\\n\\nand reflection, which accounts in part for the\\n\\ncomplexity within each ethical outlook. ethics\\nas a system of norms employs many compo-\\nnent concepts, including obligations and\\nduties, virtues of character, standards of value\\n\\nand goodness in outcomes and consequences\\nof action, standards of fairness, and justice in\\n\\nallocation of resources and in reward and pun-\\n\\nishment.3human rights refer to an internationally agreed\\nupon set of principles and norms embodied in\\ninternational legal instruments. these interna-\\n\\ntional human rights principles and norms are\\n\\nthe result of deep and long-standing negotia-\\n\\ntions among member states on a range of fun-\\ndamental issues. in other words, human rights\\n\\nare generated by governments through a con-\\n\\nsensus-building process.\\nwork in ethics needs to take into accounthuman rights norms and standards, not only in\\n\\nsubstance but also in relation to the processes of\\n\\nethical discourse and reasoning. for example,\\n\\nwhere issues concern a specific population\\n\\ngroup, individuals representing this group\\n\\nshould be participants in any determination of\\nthe ethical implications of the issues affecting\\n\\nthem. ethics is particularly useful in areas of\\n\\npractice where human rights do not provide a\\n\\ndefinite answer, for example, in new and\\n\\nemerging areas where human rights law has\\n\\nnot been applied or codified, such as human\\ncloning.q.19how do human rights\\nprinciples relate \\n\\nto equity?\\nequity means that people™s needs, rather thantheir social privileges, guide the distribution\\nof opportunities for well-being.(63)this meanseliminating disparities in health and in\\nhealth™s major determinants that are systema-\\n\\ntically associated with underlying

ensuring\\nfairness. it has been used to embrace policy-\\nrelated issues, such as the accessibility, affor-\\ndability and acceptability of available health\\ncare services. the focused attention on vul-\\n\\nnerable and disadvantaged groups in society\\n\\nin international human rights instruments\\n\\nreinforces the principle of equity. also, at the\\ninternational level, human rights instruments\\n\\naddress equity by encouraging international\\n\\ncooperation to realize rights as well as\\n\\naddressing intrastate relations, most notably\\n\\nin the united nations declaration on

living adequate for\\nhealth and well-being, including necessary\\nsocial services, and the right to security in the\\nevent of sickness, disability, old age or other\\n\\nlack of livelihood is enshrined in the universal\\ndeclaration of human rights.(65)the committeeon economic, social and cultural rights has\\ndefined poverty as ﬁa human condition charac-\\nterized by sustained or chronic deprivation of\\n\\nthe resources, capabilities, choices, security \\n\\nand power necessary for the enjoyment of an \\nadequate standard of living and other civil, \\n\\ncultural, economic, political and social rights.ﬂ(66)human rights empower individuals and com-\\nmunities by granting them entitlements that\\ngive rise to legal obligations on others. human\\nrights can help to equalize the distribution and\\nexercise of power both within and between\\n\\nsocieties, mitigating the powerlessness of the\\npoor. as economic and social rights, such as the\\n\\nright to health, are increasingly gaining weight\\n\\nthrough increased normative clarity and appli-\\n\\ncation, they will provide an important tool for\\n\\npoverty reduction. ahuman rights approach\\n\\nalso requires the active and informed partici-\\n\\npation of the poor in the formulation, imple-\\nmentation and monitoring of strategies which\\nmay affect them. \\naccountability, transparency, democracy and\\ngood governance, are essential ingredients to\\n\\naddressing poverty and ill-health. legal rights\\n\\nand obligations, at the domestic and interna-\\ntional level, demand accountability: effective\\n\\nlegal remedies, administrative and political\\n\\naccountability mechanisms at the domestic\\nlevel, as well as human rights monitoring at the\\ninternational level.(68)overall, human

thus have \\nsimilar underpinnings. humanitarian law,\\n\\nhowever, has profoundly different origins and\\n\\nuses different mechanisms for its implementa-\\n\\ntion. all branches of law have, however, a \\n\\nfundamental common objective: the respect for\\n\\nhuman dignity without any discrimination\\nwhatsoever as to race, colour, religion, sex,\\n\\nbirth or wealth, or any similar criteria. in \\naddition, they share a great number of detailed\\n\\nobjectives and conceptual similarities. efforts are under way to ensure that interna-\\ntional human rights and humanitarian law\\nprinciples provide the standard and reference\\n\\nfor humanitarian action by the united nations\\nand its agencies as well as other actors. health\\npractices in preparing for, assessing, imple-\\n\\nmenting, and evaluating the impact of health\\nassistance in the context of an armed conflict\\nneed to be grounded within a framework of\\n\\ninternational law. the sick and wounded,\\n\\nhealth workers, medical equipment, hospitals\\nand various medical units (including medical\\ntransportation) are all protected under humani-\\n\\ntarian law principles. moreover, denying access\\n\\nto medical care in some circumstances could\\n\\nconstitute a war crime.(77) see paper by uwe\\nkracht, development\\n\\nconsultant and \\nco-coordinator of the\\n\\nworld alliance

acts to protect refugees\\nby spelling out specific legal provisions\\n\\nprotecting the human rights of refugees\\n\\nmost notably through the united nations\\n\\nconvention relating to the status of refugees\\n\\n(1950) and its protocol (1966).\\nhumanitarian law is the law of armedconflict or the law of wars: a body of rules\\nwhich in wartime protect persons who are\\n\\nnot or no longer participating in the hos-\\n\\ntilities and which limit methods and\\nmeans of warfare. the central instru-\\n\\nments of humanitarian law are the four\\n\\n1949 geneva conventions and their two\\n\\nadditional protocols of 1977.\\n© helena nygren-krug2925 questions & answers on health and human rights\\n25 questions & answers on health and human rights\\n30overall, humanitarian action in the field ofhealth represents action towards the fulfilment\\n\\nof the right to health in situations where the\\nthreats to health are greatest. moreover, in the\\n\\nprovision of health care in emergency situa-\\n\\ntions, consideration of the human rights\\ndimension can help ensure that strategies pay\\n\\nparticular attention to vulnerable groups. the\\n\\nparticular vulnerability of refugees, internally\\n\\ndisplaced, and migrants requires a special\\n\\nemphasis on human rights. within these\\n\\ngroups, women as single heads of households,\\n\\nunaccompanied minors, persons with disabil-\\nities, and the elderly are in need of special\\n\\nattention. specific human rights principles\\nexist that provide guidance in ensuring pro-\\n\\ntection in emergencies against exposure of\\n\\nvulnerable groups to risk-factors of disease\\n\\nand ill-health.(78)q.25how does human\\nrights relate to\\n\\nhealth development\\n\\nwork in countries?human rights are upheld as a cross-cutting issue\\nin the united nations™ development work at\\ncountry level.(80)the common country assess-\\nment (cca) and the united nations develop-\\nment assistance framework (undaf) provide\\n\\nthe major principles upon which a human rights-\\nbased approach to development is founded. the\\n\\nccaand undaf guidelines refer to the imple-\\n\\nmentation of united nations conventions and\\ndeclarations and underscore the importance of\\n\\ntaking full account of human rights in both these\\nprocesses. the ccathus helps to facilitate efforts\\n\\nfor coherent, integrated and coordinated united\\n\\nnations support to government follow-up to the\\nconferences and the implementation of conven-\\n\\ntions at the field level.this parallels the principles enunciated in theworld bank™s comprehensive development\\nframework (cdf), the joint world bank/imf\\n\\npoverty reduction strategy paper (prsp) initia-\\ntive, the formal design of which reflects human\\n\\nrights concepts and standards. aproject of the\\n\\nohchr to produce guidelines for the integra-\\n\\ntion of human rights in poverty reduction strate-\\n\\ngies, including poverty reduction strategy\\npapers (hrprs guidelines), has highlighted the\\nclose correspondence between ﬁthe realities of\\n\\npoor people,ﬂ as identified by voices of the\\n\\npoor(81)and other poverty studies, and the inter-national human rights normative framework.\\nthus, attention to human rights will help to\\nensure that the key concerns of poor people\\n\\nbecome, and remain, the key concerns of pover-\\n\\nty reduction strategies. for example, the integra-\\n\\ntion of human rights into anti-poverty strategies\\nwill help to ensure that vulnerable individuals\\n\\nand groups are not neglected; that the active and\\n\\ninformed participation of the poor is provided\\n\\nfor; that key sectoral issues (e.g. education, hous-\\ning, health and food) receive due attention; that\\n\\nimmediate and intermediate (as well as long-\\nterm) targets are identified; that effective moni-\\n\\ntoring methods (e.g. indicators and benchmarks)\\nare established; and that accessible mechanisms\\n\\nof accountability, in relation to all parties, are\\n\\ninstituted. furthermore, human rights provide\\n\\npoverty reduction strategies with norms, stan-\\n\\ndards and values that

deaths.\\n  environmental factors are important con\\n-tributors to diarrhoea, malaria, and respira\\n-\\ntory infections (among the greatest causes of \\ndeath in children under ˝), as well as injury \\nand malnutrition. about a third of all disease \\n\\nin children can be attributed to modi˘able \\n\\nenvironmental factors such as water quality \\n\\nand access, air pollution, unsafe sanitation, \\n\\nexposure to chemicals, and climate change.\\nbetter female education, reduced fertility \\nrates, urbanisation, women™s access to \\nresources, and infrastructure improvements \\n\\n(roads,

to reach \\n\\nrmncah outcome targets, as wts \\n\\nto increase coverage of healthcare interven\\n-tions. identifying why some groups have \\n\\nlower health service coverage, even in coun\\n-tries with overall strong performance, \\n\\nrequires a focus on, and measurement of, \\ndeterminants such as discrimination, pov\\n-erty, and gender inequality. all providers of \\n\\nhealthcare (including

\\n\\nneglectedša recent review of healthcare \\n\\n% lacked water \\n\\nhad no sanitation, and ˝% lacked water and \\n\\nsoap for handwashing.\\ninvestment in institutions to advocate \\nfor, pioneer new approaches, or regulate \\n\\nmultisectoral work has also been inade\\n-quate. working across sectors for health has \\n\\nproved challenging, especially in settings \\nwith a high rmncah burden. the challenge \\n\\nis not just how to identify the key interven\\n-tions in non-health sectors but how to \\n\\ncatalyse work with other sectors and con\\n-tribute to policies and interventions that are \\n\\nof core concern to other sectors but that can \\nbe shaped to maximise positive health out\\n-comes. this requires building the capacity \\n\\nof the health sector to work with other \\n sectors and identify areas of mutual con\\n-cern. issues of governance, ˘nancing (and \\n\\nco-˘nancing across sectors), implementa\\n-tion, and monitoring will need to be \\n\\naddressed to change the status quo.\\none obstacle to engaging other sectors has \\nbeen the lack of clear mechanisms for public \\n\\nand social accountability for rmncah. \\n\\ndespite progress in accountability within the \\n\\nhealth sector at global and national levels \\n\\n(including through the commission on infor\\n-mation and accountability for women™s and \\n\\nchildren™s health), little attention has been \\npaid to increasing the accountability of other \\n\\nsectors. this gap reˇects how responsibility \\n\\nfor maternal, child, and adolescent health is \\n\\nstill perceived as the interest of the health \\n\\nsector only.\\nwhat is now needed for action on determinants of rmncahensuring multisectoral action on determi\\n-nants of rmncah will require prioritisation \\nand resources to overcome the obstacles dis\\n-cussed above. global and national strate\\n-gies, including ewec ˚.˛, can contribute by \\n\\nintegrating a focus on determinants as ﬁcore \\nbusiness.ﬂ we propose four key steps for \\n\\ninclusion in such strategies.\\n˜. framing determinants and multisectoral \\nactionthe health sector often lacks conceptual \\nand practical understanding of determi\\n-nants of rmncah and multisectoral action. \\n\\nnew global and national strategies need \\ntclarify the different types of action \\n\\nrequired:\\n\\naddressing structural forces and social \\n\\nand g, \\n\\nincluding those that drive disparities, \\n\\nwhich require wide ranging cross sectoral \\n\\npolicies driven by heads of government \\n\\nand championed by key societal agents of \\n\\nchange\\nsupporting actions within single sectors \\n\\nthat form their core business (such as \\n\\nensuring children attend school and learn \\n\\nwell for the education sector, access to \\n\\nsafe water for the water and sanitation \\n\\nsector, or access to clean power for the \\n\\nenergy sector)\\nensuring the health sector recognises its \\n\\nown role in generating health disparities \\n\\n(such as discrimination and abuse, provi\\n-ential quality of care t\\n-ent groups, and inadequate water and \\n\\nenergy supplies to health facilities) and \\nmaximises its key role in primary preven\\n-tionidentifying, promoting, and co-˘nancing \\nactions that require collaboration between \\n\\ntwo or more sectors (intersectoral work) \\n\\ntoproduce joint or ﬁco-bene˘tsﬂ and to \\n\\nmaximise health bene˘ts (such as the use \\n\\nof cleaner stoves to reduce indoor air \\n pollution, or sexuality education in \\nschools).\\nalthough work on determinants often \\n\\nfocuses on intersectorts, the greatest \\n\\nbene˘ts often lie in the ˘rst two activities \\n\\nabovešaddressing structural forces and \\n\\nsocial and gender norms (for example, \\n\\nreducing poverty or increasing gender equal\\n-ity) and single sectors doing their own core \\n\\nbusiness well. for example, for the educa\\n-tion sector, keeping adolescent girls in \\n\\nschool and providing a good education that \\nenables their economic empowerment has \\n\\ngreater health impact than collaborative \\n\\nactivities to increase health literacy or \\n\\nundertake school based health clinics.\\n ˜˜ ˜\\n when considering multisectoral action, the \\n\\nhealth sector has too often focused on mar\\n-ginal collaborations at the expense of recog\\n-nising the impact of the core work of other \\n\\nsectors.\\ndeterminants also inˇuence global and \\nnational leadership, accountability, and the \\n\\nactions of the health and other sectors. \\n\\nstructural inequities in power at global, \\n\\nnational, district, and community levels \\n\\nobstruct the policy and implementation \\n\\nchoices needed for equitable delivery of \\n\\nessential services and for harnessing the \\n\\nresources needed for multisectoral imple\\n-mentation. the mdgs were not explicitly \\n\\naimed at reducing these imbalances in \\npower, and although the sdgs focus on \\n\\ninequality more explicitly, it is unclear how \\n\\nvely global targets can deal with such \\n\\nstructural challenges. global and national \\n\\nstrategies can draw from existing concep\\n-tual frameworks for determinants, such as \\n\\nthat of the commission on social determi\\n-nants of health,\\n˚˛  and recent adaptations, \\nsuch as for child wellbeing,\\n˚˜ to consider \\nhow implementation can account for these \\n\\nobstacles.\\nbox ˚: \\ndeterminants o\\nf healththe determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, and \\nthe distribution of power, money, and resources that affect these conditions.\\n˜  they encompass social, \\neconomic, political, environmental, and cultural dimensions. here, we use ﬁdeterminantsﬂ to cover all \\n\\nof these factors (ﬁsocial determinants of healthﬂ\\n˜  or ﬁunderlying determinantsﬂ\\n˚ are sometimes used \\nin a similar way).\\ndeterminants crucially influence the health of women, children, and

scientific knowledge on the links between exposure to air pollution \\nand adverse health effects in children. it is intended to inform and motivate individual and collective \\naction  by health  care\\n  \\n\\n \\nair\\n \\npollution. air pollution is a major environmental \\nhealth threat. exposure to fine par\\nticles in both the \\nambient environment and in the household causes \\nabout seven million premature deaths each year \\n(1,2)\\n. \\nambient air pollution (aap) alone imposes enormous \\ncosts on the global economy, amounting to more \\n \\nthan\\n \\nus$ 5 trillion in total welfare losses in 2013 \\n(3)\\n.\\n \\nthis public health crisis is receiving more attention, but one critical aspect is often overlooked: how \\nair pollution affects children in uniquely damaging ways. recent data released by the world health \\norganization (who) show that air pollution has a vast and terrible impact on child health and \\nsurvival. globally, 93% of all children live in environments with air pollution levels above the who \\nguidelines (see annex 2). more than one in every four deaths \\nof children under 5 years is directly or \\nindirectly related to environmental risks \\n(4)\\n. both aap and household air pollution (hap) contribute \\nto respiratory tract infections that resulted in 543 000 deaths in children under 5 years in 2016 \\n(1)\\n.\\n \\nalthough ai\\nr pollution is a global problem, the burden of disease attributable to particulate matter in \\nair is heaviest in low\\n-\\n \\nand middle\\n-\\nincome countries (lmics), particularly in the who african, \\nsouth\\n-\\neast asia, eastern mediterranean and western pacific regions \\n(1\\n,5)\\n. lmics in these regions \\n\\n \\nespecially the african region \\n\\n \\nhave the highest levels of exposure to hap due to the widespread  \\nuse of polluting fuels and technologies for basic daily needs, such as cooking, heating and lighting \\n(6)\\n. poverty is correlated \\nwith high exposure to environmental health risks. poverty can also \\ncompound the damaging health effects of air pollution, by limiting access to information, treatment \\nand other health care\\n \\nresources.\\n \\nthe enormous toll of disease and death revealed by these\\n \\nnew data should result in an urgent call to \\naction for the global community \\n\\n \\nand especially for those in the health sector. strong action to \\nreduce exposure to air pollution offers an unparalleled opportunity to protect the health of children \\neverywhere.\\n \\nhealth professionals have a central role to play in this effort. health effects experienced \\n\\nwho is exposed to unsafe levels of pollution early in life c\\n\\nhealth professionals are well positioned to communicate with families, communities and decision\\n-\\n \\nmakers about these and other serious risks of exposure to air\\n \\npollution.\\n \\nthe sustainable development goals (sdgs) \\nrecognize the importance of social and environmental \\nfactors as determinants of health. all the sdgs are clearly linked to health\\n-\\nrelated targets, reflecting \\nthe growing awareness that health, environmental and poverty alleviation are interconnected \\n\\nthat \\nensuring healthy lives for all (sdg 3) and making cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable \\n(sdg 11) require universal access to energy (sdg 7) and hinge upon combating climate change \\n(sdg 13). the launch of the 2030 agenda for sustainable developm\\nent offers an unparalleled \\n\\nimplementing evidence\\n-\\nbased policies and health practices to protect children from air pollution will, \\nin turn, be essential to\\n \\n\\ncan have enormous benefits due to avoided disease, reduced mortality and improved well\\n-\\nbeing. \\nreducing air pollution can also improve health and well\\n-\\nbeing by slowing climate chang\\ne. it is \\nestimated that, by 2030, climate change will be responsible for 250 000 deaths each year \\n(7)\\n. as \\nmany of the same pollutants that threaten health, such as black carbon and ozone (o\\n3\\n), are also \\nimportant agents of atmospheric warming, interventions\\n \\nthat reduce their emissions are likely to \\n\\n \\nclimate.\\n \\nwe must seize this opportunity to create healthy, sustainable environments for our children.  \\neveryone has a role to play, at every level: individuals\\n, families, paediatricians, family doctors, \\nnurses, obstetricians and gynaecologists, primary health care providers and other community \\nworkers, communities, medical students, national governments and international agencies. their \\nefforts should be guided \\nby the best available evidence on the health effects of air pollution \\non \\nchildren\\n \\nand\\n \\non\\n \\neffective\\n \\ninterventions\\n \\nto\\n \\ncounter\\n \\nthem.\\n \\nthis\\n \\ndocument\\n \\nis\\n \\ndesigned\\n \\nto\\n \\nsupport\\n \\nthis\\n \\nthe evidence is clear: air \\npollution has a devastating

both policy\\n-\\nmakers and health professionals. as \\nchildren \\nexperience the consequences of air pollution in special, specific ways, they deserve to be \\nassessed in a special way. this publication provides practical, reliable information for health \\nprofessionals, paediatricians and other clinicians in all countries. \\nit will be a useful reference for \\n\\nhealth and a source

how air pollution affects\\n \\n\\ns already ample evidence to justify strong, swift \\naction to prevent the damage it clearly produces. health professionals must come together to address \\nthis threat as a priority, through collective, coordinated efforts. for the millions of children exposed \\nto polluted air every day, there is little time to waste and so much to be\\n \\ngained.\\n \\n

high\\n-\\nincome countries (hics) \\n\\n \\nespecially in low\\n-\\n \\nincome communities within those countries \\n\\n \\nthe vast majority of child deaths from exposure to \\nparticula\\nte matter air pollution occur in lmics.\\n \\nexposure to air pollution from particulate matter occurs both outdoors and indoors. aap is primarily \\nderived from fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, waste incineration, agricultural practices \\nand natural \\nprocesses such as wildfires, dust storms and volcanic eruptions. the main sources of air \\npollution may vary from urban to rural areas, but no area is, strictly speaking, safer. aap was \\nresponsible for 4.2 million premature deaths in 2016; of these, almost \\n300 000 were children under 5 \\nyears \\n(1,2)\\n.\\n \\nthe risks associated with breathing hap can be just as great. breathing clean air at home is essential \\n\\ncooking, heating\\n \\nand lighting results in far too many children living in terribly polluted home \\nenvironments. about three billion people worldwide still depend on polluting fuels and devices for \\ncooking and heating \\n(3)\\n. women and children spend most of their time around t\\nhe hearth, exposed to \\nsmoke from cooking fires, resulting in indoor concentrations of some pollutants that are five or six \\ntimes the levels in ambient air. the widespread lack of access to clean household energy has tragic \\nconsequences on a vast scale: hap\\n \\nwas responsible for 3.8 million premature deaths in 2016, \\nincluding over 400 000 deaths of children under 5 years \\n(4)\\n.\\n \\n \\nexposure to ambient air pollution\\n \\n \\nthe proportions of children exposed to levels of fine particulate matter (pm\\n2.5\\n) higher than the who\\n \\nair quality guideline levels (fig. 1) are as follows:\\n \\n\\n \\n93% of all children and about 630 million children under 5 years in the\\n \\nworld;\\n \\n\\n \\nin lmics, 98% of all children under 5\\n \\nyears;\\n

for cooking is almost exclusively a problem \\nin lmics, as 83% of \\nthe population in the african region, 59% in the south\\n\\neast asia region and \\n42% in the western pacific region rely primarily on polluting cooking fuels. the eastern \\nmediterranean region follows, with 31% of its population relying primarily on polluting fue\\nls and \\ndevices, while the proportions in the region of the americas and the european region are 13% and \\n6%, respectively.\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\nair pollution is a global public health crisis. exposure to pollutants \\nin the air threatens the health of \\npeople of all ages, in every part of the world, in both urban and rural areas, but it affects the most \\nvulnerable among us \\n\\n \\nchildren \\n\\n \\nin unique ways. children are at greater risk than adults from the \\nmany adverse health\\n \\neffects of air pollution, owing to a combination of behavioural, environmental \\nand physiological factors. children are uniquely vulnerable and susceptible to air pollution,  \\nespecially during fetal development and in their earliest years. their lungs, org\\nans and brains are still \\nmaturing. they breathe faster than adults, taking in more air and, with it, more pollutants. children \\nlive closer to the ground, where some pollutants reach peak concentrations. they may spend much \\ntime outside, playing and engagin\\ng in physical activity in potentially polluted air. new\\n-\\nborns and \\ninfants, meanwhile, spend most of their time indoors, where they are more susceptible to hap. \\nchildren spend much time near their mothers while the latter cook with polluting fuels and\\n \\ndevices.\\n \\nchildren have a longer life expectancy than adults, so latent disease mechanisms have more time to \\nemerge and affect their health. their bodies, and especially their lungs, are rapidly developing and \\ntherefore more vulnerable to inflammation and o\\nther damage caused by pollutants. in the womb, they \\n\\ncan also impose latent risks on the fetus. even after birth, they often remain powerless to change their\\n \\nenvironment: the very youngest cannot simply get up and walk out of a smoke\\n-\\nfilled room. the \\nconsequences of their exposure \\n\\n \\nthrough inhalation, ingestion or in utero \\n\\n \\ncan lead to illness and \\nother health burdens that last a lifetime. but children depen\\nd entirely on us \\n\\n \\nadults \\n\\n \\nto protect them \\nfrom the threat of unsafe air.\\n \\n11\\n \\n \\nlmic, low\\n-\\n \\nand middle\\n-\\nincome country; hic,

action plan for the prevention and \\ntreatment of pneumonia and diarrhoea, the every newborn action plan a\\nnd the nurturing care \\nframework for early childhood development (see annex 1).\\n \\n \\n \\nsources of air pollution\\n \\nambient air pollution: health toll, sources and solutions\\n \\naap caused about 4.2 million premature deaths in 2016 (\\n2\\n). it is estimated that, in 2016, 286 000 \\nchildren under 15 years of age died from exposure to unhealthy levels of aap \\n(\\nsee annex 2\\n)\\n. \\nambient air is polluted from many different sources, both anthropogenic and natural, which differ in \\nurban to rural areas.\\n \\nin urban settings, the main sources are fossil fuel combustion for energy \\nproduction, transport, residential cooking, heating and waste incineration. rural communities in \\nlmics are exposed to pollution emitted primarily from household burning of kerosene,\\n \\nbiomass and \\ncoal for cooking, heating and lighting, from agricultural waste incineration and from certain agro\\n-\\n \\nforestry activities \\n(7)\\n. these processes produce complex mixtures of pollutants that can interact \\nchemically. they typically include carbon mon\\noxide (co), nitrogen oxides (no\\nx\\n), lead, arsenic, \\nmercury, sulfur dioxide (so\\n2\\n), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and particulate matter \\n(pm). the last affects more people than any other air pollutant, and it is commonly used as a proxy \\nindicator of\\n \\nair pollution more\\n \\nbroadly.\\n \\naddressing aap is a high priority for governments and multilateral agencies around the world. many \\nproven solutions are available to reduce emissions of dangerous pollutants, including cleaner \\ntransport, cleaner cooking and hea\\nting fuels and technologies, energy\\n-\\nefficient housing and urban \\nplanning, low\\n-\\n \\nor zero\\n-\\nemission power generation, cleaner, safer industrial technologies and better\\n \\n15\\n \\n \\nmunicipal waste management \\n(8)\\n. the who air quality guidelines \\n(8) \\nprovide r\\necommended \\nthresholds and limits for key ambient air pollutants that must be met in order to protect health; an \\nupdated version will be published in 2020.\\n \\n \\n \\nhousehold air pollution: health toll, sources and solutions\\n \\nhap \\n\\n \\nthe single largest environment\\nal health risk factor worldwide \\n\\n \\nis produced mainly by the \\nincomplete combustion of polluting fuels for cooking, heating and lighting \\n(3, 7)\\n. in 2016, who \\nestimated that about three billion people \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nused polluting cooking \\nso\\nurces, most of them in lmics \\n(3)\\n. this number has remained largely unchanged for the past three \\ndecades. the damage to health caused by such widespread dependence on polluting energy sources is \\nsevere and extensive: in 2016, hap from solid fuel use resulte\\nd in an estimated 3.8 million premature \\ndeaths\\n. \\nthis toll is equivalent to 6.7% of global mortality, greater than that from malaria, tuberculosis \\n(tb) and hiv/aids combined. of these deaths, 403 000 were among children under 5 years of age \\n(4)\\n. hap is also\\n \\nan important source of aap, as residential cooking contributes as much as 12% of \\nglobal pm\\n2.5 \\nto ambient air \\n(7)\\n.\\n \\nin many parts of the world, children are especially vulnerable to hap because they spend a great deal \\nof time in the home and with their moth\\ners as the latter tend the hearth. smoke emitted from burning \\nbiomass, coal, charcoal and kerosene to meet the basic needs of cooking, heating and lighting is the \\nprimary contributor to hap \\n(3)\\n. burning these fuels in inefficient devices produces complex m\\nixtures \\nof contaminants. in dwellings with poor ventilation, emissions of fine particulate matter and other \\npollutants from stoves can reach 100 times the maximum exposure level recommended by who \\n(7)\\n.\\n \\nin 2014 who issued \\nguidelines for indoor air quality: \\nhousehold fuel combustion (9)\\n, the first \\nguidelines to define fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting that are clean for health \\nat the point of use, including electricity, liquefied petroleum gas (lpg), biogas, ethanol and solar \\nstoves, as\\n \\nwell as some high\\n-\\nperforming biomass stoves. the guidelines discourage household use of \\nkerosene and unprocessed coal because of the serious associated health hazards. unfortunately, \\nkerosene is still used for lighting by many of the about one billion peo\\nple who lack access to \\nelectricity. achieving universal access to clean, safe household energy is a top priority on the global \\n\\nsustainable and modern energy for all\\n\\n \\n \\n \\nother indoor sources\\n \\nmany other air pollutants that are risks to health are beyond the scope of this report. these include \\nvolatile organic compounds from household products and building supplies, asbestos, pesticides, \\nmercury (e.g. from broken thermo\\nmeters), radon and biological pollutants. tobacco smoke is another \\nsignificant source of indoor air pollution and a health risk for children; the health effects of tobacco \\nsmoke have been reviewed extensively in other who documents.\\n \\n \\n \\nsocial determinants \\n\\n \\npoverty is strongly correlated with exposure to air pollution. children in lmics and in low\\n-\\nincome \\ncommunities within hics disproportionately suffer the effects of air pollution. poverty causes people \\nto rely on polluting energy source\\ns for their basic needs, and poverty compounds the health risks \\n\\nthey raise their children. air pollution is often a chronic problem in poor\\n-\\nquality housing\\n \\nand \\ntemporary settlements. the exposure of people living in refugee camps can be particularly high, as \\nthey are forced to scavenge for nearby wood and other fuels or to rely on kerosene stoves for heating \\nand cooking.\\n \\nwomen and girls are the primary users\\n \\nand procurers of household energy around the world. \\ndependence on the energy sources that produce the most hap (e.g. wood and other solid fuels) used \\nin inefficient stoves also poses other important health and safety risks. in many lmics, children have \\nth\\ne daily or weekly task of fuel collection, often walking long distances with heavy loads of wood \\nand other fuels. a who analysis of survey data from 16 african countries in 2016 found that girls in \\nhouseholds\\n \\nthat\\n \\nused\\n \\npolluting\\n \\nfuels\\n \\nand\\n \\ntechnologies\\n \\nspen\\nt\\n \\nabout\\n \\n18\\n \\nhours\\n \\neach\\n \\nweek\\n \\ncollecting\\n \\n16\\n \\n \\nwood or water, whereas girls in households in which clean fuels and technologies were used \\nprimarily spent 5 hours each week in those tasks \\n(7)\\n. this work robs children of time sp\\nent for \\nplaying and studying. it also leads to musculoskeletal disorders and can expose children, particularly \\ngirls, to higher risk of violence as they venture far from their household \\n(7,\\n \\n10)\\n.\\n \\n \\nhealth effects\\n \\nthere is compelling evidence that exposure to\\n \\nair pollution damages the health of children in \\nnumerous ways. the evidence summarized in this report is based on a scoping review of relevant \\nstudies published within the past 10 years and input from dozens of experts around the world. it \\ncovers adverse \\nbirth outcomes, infant mortality, neurodevelopmental disorders, childhood obesity, \\nlung function, alri, asthma, otitis media and childhood cancers.\\n \\nadverse birth outcomes\\n. numerous studies have shown a significant association between exposure \\nto aap and a\\ndverse birth outcomes, especially exposure to pm, so\\n2, \\nno\\nx, \\no\\n3 \\nand co. there is  \\nstrong evidence that exposure to ambient pm is associated with low birth weight. there is also \\ngrowing evidence that maternal exposure, especially to fine pm, increases the ri\\nsk of preterm birth. \\nthere is emerging evidence for associations between exposure to air pollution and other outcomes, \\nsuch as stillbirth and infants born small for gestational\\n \\nage.\\n \\ninfant mortality\\n. there is compelling evidence of an association between a\\nir pollution and infant \\nmortality. most studies to date have focused on acute exposure and aap. as pollution levels \\nincrease, so too does the risk of infant mortality, particularly from exposure to pm and toxic\\n \\ngases.\\n \\nneurodevelopment. \\na growing body of re\\nsearch suggests that both prenatal and postnatal exposure \\nto air pollution can negatively influence neurodevelopment, lead to lower cognitive test outcomes and \\ninfluence the development of behavioural disorders such as autism spectrum disorders and attenti\\non \\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder. there is strong evidence that exposure to aap can negatively affect \\n\\n \\nchildhood obesity. \\na limited number of studies have identified a potential association between \\nexposure to aap a\\nnd certain adverse metabolic outcomes in children. the findings include positive \\nassociations between exposure to air pollution in utero and postnatal weight gain or attained body\\n-\\n \\nmass index (bmi) for age, and an association has been reported between traf\\nfic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution \\nand insulin resistance in children.\\n \\nlung function. \\n\\nfunction and impedes their lung function growth, even at lower levels of exposure. studies have \\nfound compelling evidence that prenatal exposure to air pollution is associated \\nwith impairment of \\nlung development and lung function in childhood. conversely, there is evidence that children \\nexperience better lung function growth in areas in which ambient air quality has\\n \\nimproved.\\n \\nalri, including pneumonia. \\nnumerous studies offer com\\npelling evidence that exposure to \\naap \\nand hap increases the risk of alri in children. there is robust evidence that exposure to air \\npollutants such as pm\\n2.5\\n, nitrogen dioxide (no\\n2\\n) and o\\n3 \\nis associated with pneumonia and other \\nrespiratory infections in \\nyoung children. growing evidence suggests that pm has an especially strong \\neffect.\\n \\nasthma. \\nthere is substantial evidence that exposure to aap increases the risk of children for \\ndeveloping asthma and that breathing pollutants exacerbates childhood asthma as\\n \\nwell. while \\nrelevant there are fewer studies on hap, there is suggestive evidence that exposure to hap from use \\nof polluting household fuels and technologies is associated with the development and exacerbation of \\nasthma in\\n \\nchildren.\\n \\notitis media. \\nthere is\\n \\nclear, consistent evidence of an association between aap exposure and the \\noccurrence of otitis media in children. although relatively few studies have examined the association \\nbetween non\\n-\\ntobacco smoke hap and otitis media, there is suggestive evidence th\\nat combustion\\n-\\n \\nderived hap may increase the risk of otitis media.\\n \\nchildhood cancers. \\nthere is substantial evidence that exposure to traffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution is \\nassociated with increased risk of childhood leukaemia. several studies have found associati\\nons \\nbetween prenatal exposure to aap and higher risk of retinoblastomas and leukaemia in children.\\n \\n17\\n \\n \\nbe informed.\\n \\nrecognize exposure and related health conditions. \\nresearch,

contains many known classified \\ncarcinogens.\\n \\nrelation between early exposure and later health outcomes. \\nchildren exposed to air pollution \\nprenatally and in early life is more likely to experience adverse health outcomes as they mature and\\n \\nthrough adulthood. exposure to air pollution early in life can impair lung development, reduce lung \\nfunction and increase the risk of chronic lung disease in adulthood. evidence suggests that prenatal \\nexposure to air pollution can predispose individuals t\\no cardiovascular disease later in life.\\n \\naltogether, there is clear, compelling evidence of significant associations between exposure to air \\npollution and a range of adverse health outcomes. the evidence suggests that the early years, starting \\nin pregnancy\\n\\nenvironment and reduce their exposure to pollutants. this window of time offers, in effect, a great \\nopportunity: precisely because children are most vulnerable and sensitive\\n \\nto environmental influences \\nin their earliest years, action taken during this critical phase can yield immense health benefits.\\n \\n \\n \\nrecommended actions for health professionals\\n \\nthe scientific evidence outlined above suggests many clear, concrete steps that \\ncan be taken now to \\nreduce the exposure of pregnant women, children and adolescents to air pollution.\\n \\nhealth professionals are trusted sources of information and guidance. they play an important role not \\nonly in treating ill health caused by air pollution \\nbut also in educating families and patients about \\nrisks and solutions and communicating with the broader public and decision\\n-\\nmakers (fig. 5). the role \\nof health professionals in the management of childhood exposure to air pollution must be amplified, \\nthrou\\ngh improved methods of care and prevention and collective action. health professionals can \\nprovide evidence to shape public health policy and advocate for effective policies to reduce  \\n\\ncome more engaged in \\ndeveloping a comprehensive approach to addressing this\\n \\ncrisis.\\n \\n \\n \\nfig. 5. critical role of health professionals\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nbe informed\\n. all health professionals should consider air pollution a major risk factor for their \\npatients \\nand understand the sources of environmental exposure in the communities they serve. they \\nshould be informed about existing and emerging evidence on the ways in which air pollution may \\n\\n \\n \\nrecognize exposure and health related conditions. \\nhealth professionals have an important role in \\nidentifying causative risk factors in order to prevent disease. a health care provider can identify air \\npollution\\n-\\nrelated risk factors by asking pertinent ques\\n\\nenvironment.\\n \\n \\nresearch, publish and disseminate knowledge. \\nhealth professionals can conduct research on the \\n\\n \\n18\\n \\n \\nmechanisms and effects of environmental exposure of children, as well as potential treatment, \\nprevention and management. they can also use this evidence to inform social and behaviour change \\ncommunication strategies.\\n \\n \\nprescribe solutions\\n \\nand educate families and communities. \\n\\nsolutions to air pollution\\n-\\nrelated problems, such as switching to clean household fuels and devices. in \\ncontexts in which there are significant barriers to adopting clean household\\n \\nenergy, health care \\n\\nthey can provide resources and information on relevant government and non\\n-\\nprofit programmes to \\nhelp reduce exposure.\\n \\n \\neducate colle\\nagues and students. \\nby training others in the health and education fields, health \\nprofessionals can increase the reach of their messages on the health risks of air pollution and \\nstrategies to reduce exposure. health professionals can engage their colleague\\ns in their workplace, \\nlocal health care centres, conferences and professional associations. they can support the inclusion of \\n\\n-\\nsecondary institutions and particularly in \\nmedical, nursing and midwifery\\n \\nsch\\nools.\\n \\n \\nadvocate solutions to other sectors, policy\\n-\\n \\nand decision\\n-\\nmakers\\n. health professionals are well \\npositioned to share their knowledge with decision\\n-\\nmakers, including members of local governments \\nand school boards and other community leaders. health pr\\nofessionals can accurately convey the \\nhealth burden of air pollution to decision\\n-\\nmakers, conduct health\\n-\\nbased assessments, support \\nimproved standards and policies to reduce harmful exposures, advocate for monitoring and \\nemphasize the need to protect childr\\nen at\\n \\nrisk.\\n \\n \\nthe need for collective action, equity and access\\n \\n \\nlow\\n-\\nincome families have limited options to improve the air quality in their homes. because of \\nmarket and other forces beyond their control, clean fuels and technologies may not be affordable,\\n \\navailable or accessible. outside the household, individuals and families have even less control over \\nwhat is emitted into the air that surrounds them. individual protective measures such as use of clean \\nstoves for cooking may mitigate hap and improve the \\nhealth of the whole family; however, reducing \\naap requires wider action, as individual protective measures are not only insufficient, but neither \\nsustainable nor equitable. to reduce and prevent exposure to both hap and aap, public policy is\\n \\nessential.\\n \\n \\nair pollutants do not recognize \\npolitical borders but travel \\nwherever the wind and prevailing \\nweather patterns take them. \\ntherefore,\\n \\nregional\\n \\nand \\ninternational\\n \\n \\ncooperative

vulnerable, voiceless citizens: \\nchildren who have little or no control over the air they breathe. individual efforts can add up to \\ncollective action that changes minds, changes policies and

levels of air pollution. the \\nresult is a global public health emergency. air pollution, whether encountered outdoors or \\nindoors, \\n\\n\\n \\nincluding 630 million children under 5 \\n\\n \\nwere exposed to ambient levels of fine pm (pm\\n2.5\\n) pollution \\nthat exceed the annual mean who air qualit\\ny guideline (see annex 2). about three billion people \\nwere exposed to hap from the use of polluting fuels for cooking in 2016 \\n(1)\\n.\\n \\n\\nresponsible for an estima\\nted 26% of all child deaths worldwide \\n(2)\\n. alri are the second leading \\nkiller of children under 5 years worldwide \\n(3)\\n. together, aap and hap cause more than 50% of all \\nalri in children under 5 in lmics \\n(4)\\n. in 2016, aap and hap were together responsible fo\\nr \\napproximately 543 000 deaths among children under 5 from alri, accounting for almost 10% of all \\nchild deaths that year \\n(5)\\n. over 99.9% of those deaths were in lmics. in 2016, alri caused by \\nhap \\nwas\\n \\nresponsible\\n \\nfor\\n \\n441\\n \\n000\\n \\ndeaths\\n \\nand\\n \\naround\\n \\n40\\n \\nmillion\\n \\ndalys\\n \\nin\\n \\nchildren\\n \\nunder\\n \\n15\\n \\n(6)\\n.\\n \\namong\\n \\nchildren aged 5\\n\\n15 years, 52 000 deaths were \\nattributed to the joint effect of hap and aap \\nin 2016 \\n(7)\\n. these deaths and lost years of \\nhealthy life could largely be prevented by \\nimproving the environmental conditions to \\nwhich children are exposed.\\n \\n \\n \\nthe he\\naviest burden on the smallest shoulders\\n \\nair pollution cuts so many lives short, but it can also lead to health burdens that last a lifetime. \\nexposure increases the risks of adverse birth outcomes, neurodevelopmental disorders and reduced \\nlung function. in \\naddition to respiratory infections, it is also clearly linked to a higher risk of \\ndeveloping asthma, a major cause of morbidity in children.\\n \\nthe toll is perhaps most severe on the very youngest. fetuses and infants have long been recognized \\nas especially v\\nulnerable to the effects of exposure to environmental agents such as air pollutants, with \\npossible lifelong consequences \\n(8)\\n\\nhealthy years of life \\n(9)\\n. a child exposed in the first month\\ns of life can suffer lifelong effects, \\nincluding increased risks of heart disease, stroke and cancer. a growing body of evidence suggests \\nthat air pollution can adversely affect cognitive and behavioural development in children and that \\nearly exposure migh\\nt lead to the development of chronic disease in adulthood \\n(4)\\n. better \\nunderstanding of the effects of air pollution on fetal and childhood growth and disease development \\nis critically important to inform actions and policies to protect public\\n \\nhealth.\\n \\nchild\\nren live, learn and grow in various contexts and environments: the home, school, the \\nplayground, the neighbourhood, the community, the country and the world at large. in these settings, \\nthey encounter pollutants from a wide range of sources, with varying e\\nffects on their health. for \\ninstance, young children in lmics often spend much of their time with their mothers around the \\nhome and hearth and are thus exposed to high levels of smoke emitted from cooking and heating \\nstoves. in poorly ventilated homes, the\\ny may breathe polluted air at levels that far exceed who \\nguidelines, while their sensitive airways, lungs and immune systems are still developing \\n(10)\\n. \\ncompounding these risks is the fact that children are at the mercy of their environment, with little to \\nno control over their living conditions. air pollution has not only effects on physical health effects \\nbut can add psychological burdens of stress and anxiety\\n \\n(10)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nclear and mounting evidence\\n \\nthere is a large body of research on the effects of air pollu\\ntion on child health, which is reviewed in \\nthis report, including effects on fetal growth and birth outcomes, lung development and function, \\nasthma, respiratory infection and otitis media. the links between air pollution and \\nneurodevelopmental disorders (i\\nncluding autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity \\ndisorder) are also reviewed, as are associations between air pollution and obesity or insulin resistance \\nin children (conditions that can develop into metabolic syndrome or diabetes mell\\nitus in later life).\\n \\nair pollution causes over half of all \\ndeaths from acute lower respiratory \\ninfections in children under 5 in low\\n-\\n \\nand middle\\n-\\nincome countries.\\n \\n21\\n \\n \\nthe report focuses on exposure to aap and hap from the combustion of polluting fuels. it does not \\ninclude the evidence for all sources of indoor air pollution, such as second\\n-\\nhand tobacco smoke, \\nwhich are beyond the scope of this document. the evidence of \\nthe harm done by tobacco smoking \\nand second\\n-\\nhand smoke to people of all ages is well established. the who framework convention \\non tobacco control and other initiatives (e.g. the tobacco free initiative) were created to reduce \\nexposure to tobacco smoke. the\\n \\nfinal section of this document gives suggestions for actions by \\nclinicians and other health care professionals to address the health effects of air pollution, some of \\nwhich include actions to reduce exposure to tobacco\\n \\nsmoke.\\n \\nsince publication of the mon\\n\\ndevelopment by the who regional office for europe in 2005 \\n(11)\\n, many studies have been \\npublished that strengthen the evidence of links between aap and hap and health effects in children. \\nthis \\nreport summarizes the findings of the latest peer\\n-\\nreviewed research on a number of health \\neffects. as there are many studies, the report is based on systematic reviews, meta\\n-\\nanalyses and \\nrecent studies (published in the past 10\\n \\nyears).\\n \\nevidence of causal l\\ninks is lacking for many exposures, as epidemiology cannot prove causation. \\naction is warranted, however, when there is sufficient evidence from epidemiological studies and \\nexperimental research that strongly suggests causality. a significant number of stu\\ndies have \\nestablished associations between air pollution and various health outcomes. for outcomes for which \\n\\nsuggested.\\n \\nfor certain health outcomes, studies prov\\nide strong evidence of the effects of exposure to aap, but \\nthere are relatively few studies of the links with hap. as the sources of aap and hap often overlap \\nsignificantly, the evidence for aap could be considered indirect evidence for the health effects \\nof \\n\\nsensitive, developmental stages of early life, should take precedence over establishing near\\n-\\ncertainty \\nabout the full extent of the risk and the mechanisms involv\\ned. preventive strategies could be based on \\nthe evidence for aap on the assumption that hap has similar\\n \\neffects.\\n \\n \\n \\ninforming action\\n \\nscientific understanding of the serious risks posed by air pollution early in life is robust and growing. \\nthis knowledge mus\\nt be translated into action. taken together, the body of evidence provides ample \\nsupport for strong action and effective policy measures. the closing section of this review \\naccordingly suggests specific, concrete actions for paediatricians, obstetricians, \\nhealth care providers, \\ncommunities and families responsible for protecting fetuses, infants

\\n \\n2.\\n \\nroutes of exposure to air\\n \\npollution\\n \\nfetuses, infants and children have unique vulnerability and \\nsusceptibility to the risks of exposure to \\nair pollution, including subsequent development of adverse health outcomes. these heightened risks \\nare due to a combination of behavioural, environmental and physiological factors. (note: detailed \\ninformation on t\\nhe sources of ambient and hap can be found in section 4 below.)\\n \\n \\n2.1\\n \\ninhalation\\n \\ninhalation is the primary means by which air pollutants enter the human body, through the lungs and \\nalveoli (tiny air\\n-\\nfilled sacs located at the end of the bronchioles in the lungs\\n \\nwhere oxygen exchanges \\nwith carbon dioxide in the blood). during the first few years of life, the numbers of alveoli increase \\nrapidly, after which the volume begins to increase; this is therefore a critical window of growth, \\nwhich may be affected by inhal\\ned pollutants \\n(1)\\n. the lungs grow throughout childhood and \\nadolescence and may be exposed to many airborne pollutants that harm growth and function \\n(1)\\n. as \\nchildren\\n \\nbreathe\\n \\nat\\n \\ntwice\\n \\nthe\\n \\nrate\\n \\nthat\\n \\nadults\\n \\ndo,\\n \\nthey\\n \\ninhale\\n \\nlarger\\n \\namounts\\n \\nof\\n \\nair\\n \\npollutants\\n \\n(2)\\n.\\n \\n23\\n \\n \\nparticles are also moved through the respiratory system faster, allowing them to reach the lungs, the \\nalveoli and the bloodstream more rapidly \\n(3)\\n. in addition, children are more physically active than \\nadults, so that their ventilation i\\ns even greater; and they are closer to the ground, where the levels of \\npollutants are often more concentrated \\n(4)\\n. in the case of particulate pollution, the \\nsize of the particle \\ndetermines how far into the body it penetrates and where it is deposited. part\\nicles < 10 µm in \\ndiameter (pm\\n10\\n) are typically filtered out through the nose, whereas smaller particles, such as pm\\n2.5 \\n(particles < 2.5 µm in diameter) can penetrate deeper and reach the lower airways\\n. \\nas children \\ntypically breathe through their mouths, th\\ne nasal filtration mechanism is often bypassed, \\nso that more \\nparticles move into their lungs than is the case for adults \\n(3)\\n. \\n\\nventilation rate also increases \\n(5,6)\\n, increasing both her own exposure and that of her\\n \\nfetus.\\n \\nch\\nildhood exposure to air pollution by inhalation is associated with disease later in life. exposure to \\nvarious pollutants, including black carbon, no\\n2\\n, pm\\n2.5 \\nand pm\\n10\\n, is linked to the development of \\nasthma in children \\n(7\\n\\n9)\\n, presumably due in large part to\\n \\nthe generation of oxidative stress and \\nairway inflammation \\n(10)\\n. research also indicates that pm may cause systemic inflammatory and \\nimmunological responses and remodelling in the lung\\n \\n(11)\\n.\\n \\nother authors have found that ultrafine particles (< 0.1 µm in d\\niameter) can cross the alveoli, enter \\nthe bloodstream and cause cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease \\n(12\\n\\n15)\\n. research shows that \\npm\\n10 \\nstimulates alveolar macrophages to release the prothrombotic cytokine il\\n-\\n6, which can cause \\naccelerated arterial th\\nrombosis and increase the risk of cardiovascular events\\n \\n(16)\\n.\\n \\n \\nfig. 6. smaller particles of particulate matter penetrate deeper into the\\n \\nlungs\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nsource: reference \\n(17)\\n \\n \\ninhalation of co can also have significant health consequences (boxes \\n1 and 2). once absorbed, co \\nquickly binds the haemoglobin of red blood cells (which have a high affinity for co), creating \\ncarboxyhaemoglobin, which displaces oxygen, potentially leading to tissue hypoxia \\n(18)\\n. \\nenvironmental exposure to co has been linked \\nto cardiovascular illness and elevated levels of \\ncarboxyhaemoglobin in adults. evidence suggests that chronic exposure to co may cause changes to \\nthe structure and function of the heart that could leave it more susceptible to stress \\n(19)\\n.\\n \\n \\nbox 1. dangers o\\nf carbon monoxide\\n \\nco is a colourless, odourless, tasteless toxic gas produced by incomplete oxidation during the combustion of \\nfuels. it can be emitted from household cooking and heating systems, vehicle exhaust, industrial processes and \\nfires \\n(20)\\n. co \\ninhalation can be deadly. breathing is the only pathway for co to enter the body, where it \\ncombines with haemoglobin in the blood and reduces oxygen\\n-\\ncarrying capacity of the blood. children are most\\n \\n24\\n \\n \\nsusceptible to co toxicity due to their\\n \\nhigher metabolic rates \\n(21)\\n. symptoms of co intoxication can include \\nheadaches, irritability, dizziness, fatigue, weakness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, loss of consciousness, skin \\npallor, dyspnoea, palpitations, confusion and irrational behaviour \\n(21)\\n.\\n \\nlow levels of co can be found in ambient air near roads and parking areas. common indoor sources of co \\nvary across high\\n-\\n, low\\n-\\n \\nand middle\\n-\\nincome countries. in high\\n-\\nincome countries, the main indoor source of co \\nis emissions from defective appliances for co\\noking or heating. if they \\nare \\nnot properly maintained, gas burners, \\nwood\\n-\\nburning fireplaces, clogged chimneys and supplementary heaters can all be potential sources of co. high \\nlevels of co have also been measured in both public and residential garages. in\\n \\nlow\\n-\\n \\nand middle\\n-\\nincome \\ncountries, the most important sources are the burning of biomass fuels, especially in poorly ventilated kitchens, \\nand tobacco smoke\\n \\n(22)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nbox 2. case study: carbon monoxide: an invisible threat at home\\n \\nafter moving into a new hou\\nse, a 9\\n-\\nyear\\n-\\nold child began experiencing recurring headaches and gastrointestinal \\ndiscomfort. these symptoms were followed by an episode of loss of

suffered an episode of loss of consciousness. the ultimate diagnosis \\n\\n-\\nburning stove used \\nfor \\nheating during winter.\\n \\ncase report by amalia laborde, professor of toxicology, university of the republic, uruguay\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2.2\\n \\nin\\n \\nutero\\n \\nthe placenta plays a crucial role in the growth and development of the fetus, providing nutrients and \\noxygen and removing \\nwaste and toxicants throughout pregnancy \\n(23\\n\\n25)\\n. because the placenta is so \\nimportant in the exchange of substances between the mother and the fetus, it is also a pathway for \\nexposure of the fetus when the mother is exposed to air pollution \\n(26, 27)\\n.\\n \\ncertain inhaled or ingested pollutants that are small enough to penetrate the alveolar wall, including \\n\\n(26,28\\n\\n31)\\n. they can then cross \\nthe placental barrier and reach the fetus, affecting gr\\nowth and development by a variety of \\nmechanisms \\n(29,32,33)\\n. they can cause oxidative stress, damage dna and reduce absorption of \\nnutrients by the fetus \\n(30,34)\\n. one study suggested that alteration of placental mitochondrial dna \\ncontent may be the mediator \\nbetween exposure to air pollution and low birth weight \\n(35). \\nexposure  \\n\\nto allergies and asthma \\n(29)\\n. maternal exposure to lead has been linked to increase\\nd fetal lead levels \\nand adverse effects on neurodevelopment later in life \\n(36). \\na recent study also shows that maternal \\nexposure to hap during pregnancy leads to chronic hypoxia in the placenta; fetal development under \\nthese conditions may be associated wi\\nth adverse pregnancy outcomes \\n(37)\\n. inflammation is another \\nimportant mechanism, as both maternal and intrauterine inflammation have been observed in \\nresponse to air pollution, a factor that is believed to play an important role in adverse birth outcomes \\na\\nnd poor neurodevelopment\\n \\n(38,39)\\n.\\n \\nthe direct consequences of air pollution on maternal health present additional risks to the fetus. for \\nexample, both aap and hap have been linked to hypertension in pregnancy \\n(40\\n\\n42). \\nhypertensive \\ndisorders in pregnancy ar\\ne a leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide \\n(43) \\nand are associated \\nwith adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth and low birth weight \\n(44,45)\\n. children whose \\nmothers experience preeclampsia during pregnancy are also at increased risk of healt\\nh complications \\nlater in life, including endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases \\n(46)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n2.3\\n \\ningestion\\n \\nair pollutants can settle on surfaces in the home, where an infant or child can ingest them. because \\npollutants can persist in the environment for som\\ne time after their release, their impact is not always \\nshort\\n-\\nlived. some substances that are released into the air, such as mercury and pesticides, can enter \\nthe hydrological cycle as a result of atmospheric dispersion and precipitation and can then  be \\nin\\ngested during contact with contaminated water, food, soil or vegetation\\n \\n(20,47)\\n.\\n \\n25\\n \\n \\nbreastfeeding is the best source of nutrition for infants, as it provides them with an optimal balance  \\nof nutrients while strengthening their immune systems\\n \\nand forming a bond between the mother and \\nthe child \\n(48)\\n. there is, however, evidence that air pollutants accumulate in breast milk, resulting in \\nexposure of the child. pollutants from industrial sources, such as pesticides, fossil fuels, chemical by\\n-\\n \\npro\\n\\ncirculation by inhalation or, more commonly, ingestion before being passed into breast milk \\n(49,50)\\n. \\nfor instance, pahs have been reported at high levels in breast\\n \\nmilk samples in the mediterranean \\n(51). \\npahs are classified as carcinogenic, and exposure through breastfeeding may result in adverse \\ndevelopmental outcomes \\n(52,53)\\n. nevertheless, the advantages of breastfeeding still far outweigh any \\nrisks from most cont\\naminants. who recommends exclusive breastfeeding for up to 6 months of age, \\nwith continued breastfeeding and appropriate complementary foods up until 2 years of age\\n \\n(50,54)\\n.\\n \\nexposure to air pollutants during the pre\\n-\\nconception period may also affect the\\n \\nhealth of both the \\nmother and the fetus. a recent study showed that maternal exposure to no\\nx \\nand so\\n2 \\nin the months \\nbefore pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for gestational diabetes mellitus, a condition \\nt\\nhat is associated with adverse birth outcomes and risks to maternal health \\n(55)\\n. studies also indicate \\nthat exposure to so\\n2 \\nbefore pregnancy may play a role in the formation of orofacial clefts \\n(56)\\n. \\npaternal exposure is also important. a study of persiste\\nnt organic pollutants indicated that exposure \\nof the mother and/or the father before conception resulted in lower birth weight\\n \\n(57)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nreferences \\n\\n \\nroutes of exposure to air pollution\\n \\n1.\\n \\ncalogero c, sly pd.

rapidly, \\nchildren are more vulnerable to permanent damage. at birth, the immune, respiratory and central \\nnervous systems are immature and highly sensitive to environmental stimuli \\n(15)\\n, and many \\nmechanisms have been proposed whereby exposur\\ne to air pollutants is linked to health effects in \\nchildren. oxidative stress and inflammation are predominant and probably play an important role in \\nperinatal outcomes and childhood asthma \\n(16,17)\\n. air pollutants may also impact endothelial \\nfunction, coag\\nulation, and maternal hemodynamic responses during pregnancy \\n(16)\\n.\\n \\nexposure to air pollution during pregnancy, a particularly critical period of development, has been \\nlinked to various health outcomes. exposure before 18 weeks of gestation has been linked \\nto \\ndiminished development. various pollutants are passed from mother to fetus with oxygen and \\n\\nthe respiratory and cardiovascular systems, cognitive impairme\\nnt, intrauterine growth restriction and \\neven compromise the development of vital organ systems \\n(2,18\\n\\n20)\\n. exposure during this critical \\nperiod has also been linked to permanent changes in the structure of the lungs, which can have \\nlifelong health consequen\\nces \\n(11,21)\\n. the timing of environmental exposure during pregnancy \\ndetermines the effect on the developing fetus: earlier exposures tend to affect development of the \\nairway tree and major pulmonary vessels, whereas later exposure can influence lung volume,\\n \\nalveoli \\nand pulmonary capillaries \\n(11)\\n.\\n \\n\\ninflammation from exposure to air pollutants can result in proportionately greater airway obstruction \\n(2,6,10,22)\\n. exposure to air pollutants can exacerbate existing health conditions in children and cause \\nadditional complications \\n(4,23)\\n. children with respiratory or cardiovascular conditions are at \\nparticular risk \\n(24)\\n.\\n \\nchildren may also be more susceptible than adu\\nlts to the effects of air pollution because of their \\nbehaviour. children spend their days closer to the floor than adults, and some pollutants in household \\nand ambient air are found in the highest concentrations in this zone, where children breathe and pla\\ny \\n(25,26)\\n\\nheight near heavy traffic \\n(23,27)\\n. in the home, children are often with or near their mothers as they\\n \\n29\\n \\n \\ncook, exposing them to additiona\\nl air pollutants. infants are often unable to move away from sources \\nof air pollution, and older children may not recognize the hazards, further compounding the risks \\n(26)\\n. older children spend more time outside, running, playing and breathing hard, and th\\nis increased \\nventilation exposes them to larger doses of aap \\n(28)\\n. infants are likely to place objects in their \\nmouth, placing them at risk of ingestion of air pollutants \\n(28)\\n. children with pica behaviour, who \\ncompulsively put objects in their mouths, are\\n \\nat particular\\n \\nrisk.\\n \\nchildren have a longer life expectancy than adults, rendering them more vulnerable to the potential \\nhealth effects of air pollution in yet another way \\n(8,12,29)\\n. they have more time to manifest a disease \\nwith a long latency period and \\nwill potentially live longer with negative health consequences \\n(15)\\n. \\nthus, the earlier their exposure, the longer the potential chronic illness or disability they will \\nexperience. this kind of cumulative exposure to air pollution can become a life sentence\\n, imposed \\njust

\\nair pollution from particulate matter is a problem that transcends geographical and political \\nboundaries. it affects people in all countries, in every type of hum\\nan settlement. it flows between \\nnations and over oceans, from outdoors to indoors to outdoors, from the upwind countryside into the \\ncity and then on to the countryside again. pollutants can be found equally in high, unsafe \\nconcentrations in the most remote\\n, rural village and on the busiest, high\\n-\\ntraffic urban streets. children \\nare threatened by this pollution in every region of the world.\\n \\nhap and aap are strongly interconnected: the former is a major, often underestimated source of the \\nlatter \\n(1,2)\\n. in this\\n \\nsection, aap and hap are treated separately, as they have been considered \\ndistinct phenomena by both scientists and policy\\n-\\nmakers. hap consists of emissions from all \\nhousehold energy, including lighting and heating. because most of the relevant research t\\no date has \\nfocused on cooking and much of the data on energy use are from surveys on cooking fuel and \\ntechnology, hap is generally perceived as a risk mostly for rural lmics \\n(3)\\n. while this is broadly \\ntrue, reliance on polluting household fuels also persis\\nts in many urban areas as well. for instance, \\nwith growing awareness of the health threat posed by aap, heating fuels are gaining attention as an \\nimportant source of air pollution, including in\\n \\nhics.\\n \\n \\n \\n4.1\\n \\nambient air\\n \\npollution\\n \\naap is a global health crisis. t\\nhe vast majority of people live in places where it is unsafe to breathe \\n\\n\\n \\nand 93% of its children \\n\\n \\nare exposed to fine pm at \\nlevels that exceed the who\\n-\\nrecommended limit (fig. 8 and 9) \\n(4)\\n. the distribution of\\n \\nthe crisis is \\nalso becoming less equal: in more than 4300 settlements monitored by who, pollution levels have \\nimproved in cities in some hics but worsened in poorer regions \\n(5)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nfig. 8. annual average concentrations of ambient pm\\n2.5 \\n\\n3\\n, 2016.\\n \\n31\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nsource: who global ambient air quality

were available. few data were available for some areas, including highly polluted \\nsettlements.\\n \\n \\naap caused about 4.2 million premature deaths in 2016 \\n(6)\\n. in 2016, an estimated 286 000 children \\nunder 15 years of age died from exposure \\nto aap (see annex 2). the sources of pollution differ in \\nurban and rural contexts \\n(7)\\n, the main sources in urban settings being fossil fuel combustion for \\nenergy production, transport, residential cooking and heating (household fuel use) and waste \\nincinera\\ntion \\n(8)\\n. use of polluting fuels persists in some higher\\n-\\nincome countries; in some countries in \\neurope and the arabian gulf, for example, coal is still used for household heating, posing a risk of \\nco poisoning for both children and adults \\n(9)\\n. the main sou\\nrce of pollution in rural communities in \\nlmics, however, is burning of kerosene, biomass and coal for cooking, heating and lighting, \\nagricultural waste incineration and certain agro\\n-\\nforestry activities \\n(8)\\n.\\n \\ninterventions to improve the quality of the air i\\nn rural areas must target these and other major  \\nsources, including excessive use of agrochemicals like fertilizers and pesticides, deforestation, small\\n-\\n \\nscale industries such as charcoal production and spontaneous forest fires, fog and dust storms \\n(10,11)\\n. \\ngeographical and meteorological factors influence the transport and chemistry of air\\n \\npollutants.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n

can affect downwind rural areas, just as rural activities \\n\\n \\nsuch as agricultural burning \\n\\n \\ncan affect air quality in nearby cit\\nies. for these reasons, interventions to improve air quality in any \\nlocality require cooperation at many levels, including regional and international (\\n1,12\\n).\\n \\npoverty is closely associated with high exposure to air pollution. lmics generally experience higher \\nlevels of exposure to pm, particularly in the who african, south\\n-\\neast asian and western pacific \\nregions \\n(4)\\n, where the annual mean levels of pm\\n2.5 \\nare 5\\n\\n10\\n \\ntimes greater than the who guideline \\nlimit \\n(13)\\n. even in regions in which pm\\n2.5 \\nlevels are lower and closer to the who limit values, such \\nas europe and latin america, the levels in lmics are almost twice those in hics. it should be noted \\nthat national est\\nimates of exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nare averages and that, even within hics, low\\n-\\nincome \\ncommunities have disproportionately higher exposure to air pollution, as they tend to be located \\ncloser to major sources, such as industrial facilities, high\\n-\\ntraffic roads and \\npower

fossil fuel combustion to crop burning to \\nwildfires, all of which produce a complex mixture of pollutants t\\nhat can interact chemically. they \\nusually include co, nitrogen oxides (no, no\\n2\\n, no\\nx\\n), lead, arsenic, mercury, so\\n2\\n, pahs and pm \\n(pm\\n2.5, \\npm\\n10\\n, and ultrafine particulate matter) \\n(16)\\n. air pollution from a combination of agricultural \\nactivities, urban emission\\ns and atmospheric conditions contributes to annual periods of extreme air \\npollution in parts of south\\n-\\neast asia \\n(2)\\n.\\n \\ncertain pollutants react in

air pollution and its health effects since 1958, including work \\nthat led to the\\n \\nfirst air quality guidelines, in the mid\\n-\\n1980s \\n(22)\\n. since the release of the current \\nversion of the who air quality guidelines in 2005, more evidence has become available on the health \\neffects of ambient air pollutants, even at relatively low concentrati\\nons. the guidelines are therefore \\nbeing revised to reflect the latest available evidence, and an updated version with recommended \\nthresholds for key air pollutants will be published in 2020.\\n \\n \\n \\n4.2\\n \\nhousehold air pollution\\n \\npolluted air inside homes, schools, \\nworkplaces and recreation facilities \\n\\n \\nspaces where pregnant \\nwomen, mothers, infants and children spend much of their time \\n\\ncause and contribute to a wide range \\nof negative health outcomes. tragically, excessive air pollution can turn the very places that \\nare \\nmeant to shelter and nurture children into places of\\n \\nrisk.\\n \\nhap is produced mainly by incomplete combustion of polluting fuels used for cooking, heating and \\nlighting and is the single largest environmental health risk factor worldwide \\n(8)\\n. hap is also a\\nn \\nimportant source of aap \\n(23)\\n. in 2016, who estimated that about three billion people \\n\\n \\n41% of the \\n\\n\\n \\nstill used polluting fuels for cooking, mostly in lmics (fig. 10) \\n(24)\\n, and this \\nnumber has remained largely unchanged for the past thr\\nee decades. the damage to health caused by \\ndependence on polluting energy sources is severe and extensive: in 2016, hap from solid fuel use \\nresulted in 3.8 million premature deaths, equivalent to 6.7% of global mortality, greater than the toll \\ndue to malar\\nia, tb and hiv/aids combined. of these deaths, 403 000 were among children under 5 \\nyears of age \\n(8,18)\\n. the risks of children are not limited to direct exposure, as there is emerging \\n\\nure to high levels of hap is linked to higher risks of adverse \\nbirth outcomes such as low birth weight \\n(25)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nfig. 10. proportions of households that used polluting fuels for cooking, 2016\\n \\n34\\n

for cooking, heating \\nand lighting is the primary contributor to hap; other signi\\nficant sources are tobacco smoke, candles, \\nincense and mosquito coils \\n(8)\\n. burning produces complex mixtures of contaminants, the \\ncomposition of which depends on the type of fuel used and on the temperature and phase of \\ncombustion \\n(26\\n\\n29)\\n. for instance, em\\nissions from the combustion of coal can contain pm, co, no\\nx\\n, \\nso\\n2\\n, benzene, pahs, carbon and several heavy metals \\n(30)\\n. kerosene combustion can emit co, no\\nx\\n, \\npm, so\\n2\\n, formaldehyde and pahs \\n(31)\\n. kerosene smoke is also extremely rich in black carbon, a \\nmajor\\n \\ncomponent of fine pm and a potent climate\\n-\\nwarming pollutant\\n \\n(32)\\n.\\n \\nin some regions, children are especially vulnerable to hap because they spend so much time in the \\nhome and with their mothers as they tend the hearth. women and girls are the main users of \\nhousehold energy around the world. they also spend significant time and effort gathering, \\ntransporting, preparing and using fuels like biomass, coal and charcoal to cook food in inefficient \\nstoves or open hearths and to heat their homes. in dwellings with \\npoor ventilation, emissions of fine \\npm and other pollutants from these stoves can exceed the maximum exposure recommended by \\nwho by 100 times\\n \\n(8)\\n.\\n \\n\\nguidelines\\n \\nfor household fuel combustion \\n(31) \\nclassify kerosene as a polluting fuel and discourage its \\nuse as a household fuel. nevertheless, kerosene is still used for lighting by many of the around one \\nbillion people who lack access to electricity. kerosene lamps \\nare often the only means of lighting \\nhouses at night, allowing children and adolescents to study in areas without electricity. use of \\nkerosene not only pollutes the air inside houses but also increases the risks for fires, burns and co \\npoisoning.\\n \\nalthough \\nsignificant numbers of urban dwellers in lmics still use polluting fuels and devices for \\ncooking, heating and lighting, the vast majority of those who use polluting household energy live in \\nrural areas (fig. 11) \\n(3)\\n. reliance on polluting fuels is especial\\nly prevalent in rural areas of the who \\nafrican, south\\n-\\neast asian and western pacific regions \\n(8)\\n. persistent use of polluting cooking, \\nheating and lighting fuels by more than three billion people \\n\\n \\nand the resulting health risks \\n\\n \\nis due \\nlargely to lack of\\n \\naccess to clean, affordable, convenient alternatives \\n(33)\\n. despite\\n \\nrecent progress in \\nall who regions in increasing access to clean fuels and technologies (fig. 12), the number of people \\nwho use polluting fuels did not change appreciably between 1990 and 2016 (fig. 13) \\n(24)\\n. given this \\ntrend, better coordinated and conce\\nrted action is required to meet the sdg 7 target of

(see also \\nannex 1.)\\n \\n \\n \\nbox 5. air pollution is a child rights issue\\n \\nno group is more vulnerable to environmental harm than children. yet, a\\n \\nhealthy environment is essential for \\nchildren to fully enjoy their right to health. the convention on the rights of the child \\n(37)\\n, the universally \\nratified human rights treaty, requires states parties to pursue full implementation of the right to health \\nby \\nappropriate measures that include the provision of nutritious foods and clean drinking\\n-\\nwater, taking into \\nconsideration the dangers and risks of environmental pollution (art. 24 (2) (c)). air pollution in particular \\n\\nh. countless children suffer disease and disability from air pollution, often \\nwith lifelong effects, as it can disrupt their physical and cognitive development.\\n \\nstates have heightened their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of children,\\n \\nwho are often unable \\nto protect themselves from environmental harm, including air pollution. the obligations include:\\n \\n37\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nstrengthen their \\ncapacity to respond to environmental\\n \\nchallenges;\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\napproved;\\n \\n\\n \\ncollecting information on sources of environmental harm to children and making the information publi\\ncly \\navailable and accessible;\\n \\n\\n \\nfacilitating the

\\ntheir\\n \\nrights.\\n \\nstates should adopt and implement environmental standards that are consistent with the best available evidence \\nand relevant international health and safety standards. \\nthus, states should implement recommendations from \\n\\n-\\nbeing from \\nenvironmental harm. a good example of concrete guidance is the report of the united nations special \\nrappo\\n\\nwell\\n-\\nbeing in mongolia by air pollution \\n(38)\\n. the rapporteur noted that, in 2017, the committee on the rights \\nof the child expressed serious concern about\\n \\nthe effects of air pollution on mongolian children, particularly in \\nthe capital, ulaanbaatar. each winter, the city has some of the most heavily polluted air in the world, as \\nresidents of \\ngers \\nburn coal in household stoves to stay warm. knox observed that\\n \\nchildren are at particular risk, \\njeopardizing their rights to life and\\n \\nhealth.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nother sources of indoor air\\n \\npollution\\n \\nmany other air pollutants are also important health risks, but fall beyond the scope of this report, \\nwhich addresses primarily source\\ns of air pollution arising from combustion. contaminants present in \\nurban and rural indoor air include volatile organic compounds, asbestos, pesticides, mercury (e.g. \\nfrom broken thermometers), radon and biological pollutants. volatile organic compounds pr\\noduce \\nvapours readily at room temperature and are emitted by thousands of household products, including \\npaints, varnishes, solvents, building materials, disinfectants, personal care products, air fresheners, art \\nand hobby supplies and vehicles used in atta\\nched garages \\n(20)\\n.\\n \\ntobacco smoke is a significant source of indoor air pollution and a health risk for children \\n(39)\\n. as \\nmany as 4000 chemicals may be present in tobacco smoke alone \\n(40)\\n. asbestos is a known \\noccupational carcinogen, and its use in \\nresidential and education buildings can contaminate indoor air \\n(30)\\n. pesticides such as insecticides and antimicrobial disinfectants are often sprayed near the ground \\nand can persist in indoor air or settle on surfaces \\n(41)\\n. radon, a radioactive carcinogen\\nic gas naturally \\npresent in some soil and rock, can enter houses, buildings and other enclosed spaces \\n(42\\n-\\n44)\\n. this \\ndocument primarily addresses sources of air pollution arising from combustion.\\n \\n \\nvarious biological pollutants are present in indoor air: dus\\nt mites, droppings and urine from pests, \\ninsects and rodents, pollen from indoor plants and outdoor air, viruses and bacteria and fungi, \\nincluding mould and mildew, or their by\\n-\\nproducts \\n(41,44,45)\\n. build\\n-\\nup of certain biological \\npollutants can trigger \\nasthma or cause allergic reactions \\n(46,47)\\n, and others are linked to the spread of \\ninfectious diseases\\n \\n(45)\\n.\\n \\n \\nworking toward solutions\\n \\n \\nwho has published a series of indoor air quality guidelines (table 3) \\n(22)\\n. there are many solutions \\nto reducing exposur\\ne to other air pollutants. in general, indoor environments can be made healthier  \\nby a few key actions: avoiding tobacco smoking, improving ventilation and reducing humidity in \\nhouses (to reduce mould and mites), storing chemicals safely and avoiding the u\\nse of unnecessary \\nchemicals and pesticides. asbestos and lead paint should no longer be used in building or renovating \\nhouses\\n \\n(21,43,48,49)\\n.\\n \\n

usa) have adopted guideline levels lower than those of \\nwho.\\n \\n \\n \\n4.3 social determinants of exposure and health\\n \\nsocial determinants of health play a central role in the effects of hap and \\naap \\non health. the \\ncircumstances in which we live powerfully influence our lives, beginning at conception \\n(51)\\n. social \\ninequalities negatively affect infant health and are associat\\ned with increased rates of infant mortality \\nrates \\n(52)\\n. studies suggest that social status, especially poverty, influences the risk of environmental \\nexposure. thus, less affluent populations are at greater risk of a variety of exposures; for example,  \\nthe \\ncombined effects of socioeconomic inequality and reduced air quality can contribute to increased \\ninfant mortality \\n(53)\\n. it has been estimated that, in 2010, 2.7\\n\\n3.4 million preterm births globally were \\nassociated with exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nduring gestation\\n \\n(53\\n).\\n \\npoverty and pollution are closely linked. poverty may force people to rely on polluting fuels for their \\nbasic needs, and poverty compounds the health risks associated with their use. poverty also limits \\n\\nenvironment in which they raise their children; for \\nexample, low\\n-\\nincome families cannot just decide to move away from a heavily polluting industrial \\nsite. air pollution is often a chronic problem in poor\\n-\\nquality housing and temporary settlements. the \\nexpos\\nure of people living in refugee camps can be particularly high, as they have to scavenge for \\nwood and other fuels or rely\\n \\non\\n \\nkerosene\\n \\nstoves\\n \\nfor\\n \\nheating\\n \\nand \\ncooking.\\n \\ndependence on the energy sources \\nthat produce most hap \\n\\n \\nsolid fuels \\nsuch as wood \\n\\n \\nalso contributes to \\nother important health risks. children, \\noften at the expense of their schooling \\nor playt\\nime, are sometimes given the \\ntasks\\n \\nof\\n \\ncooking\\n \\non\\n \\ninefficient\\n \\nstoves\\n \\nor gathering fuel. fuel collection obliges them to walk long distances with heavy loads. this work \\ncan lead to musculoskeletal disorders and can put children, particularly girls, at higher\\n \\nrisk of violent \\nattack, rape or injury as they venture far from the household \\n(8,34)\\n. the risk of attack while\\n \\ngathering\\n \\npoverty and pollution are closely \\nlinked. the poor often have higher \\nexposure to air pollution and more \\nlimited access to treatm\\nent and \\ninterventions.\\n \\n40\\n \\n \\nfuel is especially high for girls living in refugee camps \\n(54,55)\\n. an analysis of survey data in 16 \\nafrican countries \\nin 2016 showed that girls in households in which polluting fuels were used spent \\nabout 18 hours each week collecting wood or water, whereas girls in households in which clean fuels \\nwere used primarily spent 5 hours each week in such tasks \\n(8)\\n.\\n \\ngender \\nalso determines exposure of children to hap and aap. as they move through childhood, \\ntheir exposure to hap and aap may change according to their gender. in some cultures, girls are \\nkept in the kitchen with their mother for longer than boys because of socia\\nl and cultural attitudes \\ntowards the role of women \\n(56)\\n. girls are therefore more exposed to hap and boys potentially more \\nexposed to aap \\n(57)\\n. this obviously varies, as some parents have a social preference for male \\nchildren and spending more time looking\\n \\nafter them, so that they have greater exposure to hap \\n(58)\\n. \\nthe role of gender in exposure to hap and aap is complex and depends on social and cultural \\nattitudes.\\n \\n \\n \\nreferences \\n\\n \\nsources of air pollution\\n \\n1.\\n \\namman m, purohit p,

effects on \\nneurodevelopment, childhood obesity, effects on lung function, acute lower respiratory infection, \\nasthma, otitis media and childhood cancers, demonstrating the diverse range of

\\nco.\\n\\n \\na growing body of evidence shows that air pollution, particularly pm\\n2.5\\n, is associated with low\\n \\nbirth weight, and aap is associated with preterm\\n \\nbirth.\\n\\n \\nfew studies have examined the role of hap, but there is moderate \\nevidence of an association \\nbetween solid fuel combustion and low birth\\n \\nweight.\\n\\n \\n \\nthe health impacts of exposure to air pollution during the prenatal period are often overlooked but \\ncan be quite significant. a growing body of research provides evidence of \\nan association between \\nmaternal exposure to air pollution and adverse birth outcomes, including stillbirth, preterm birth, low \\nbirth weight and being small for gestational age (sga) \\n(2\\n\\n19)\\n. exposure before conception can also \\naffect the fetus, with emergin\\ng evidence of a link between exposure to air pollution from traffic and \\nother sources of aap and reproductive disease in women. a systematic literature review provides \\nsuggestive evidence of associations between exposure to aap and the incidence of reprodu\\nctive and \\ngynaecological diseases, including infertility and endometriosis, although the number of studies to \\ndate is limited\\n \\n(20)\\n.\\n \\n\\nweeks of gestation \\n(21)\\n. in 2015, an estimated 2.6 million infants were stillborn, and 98% of the \\ndeaths occurred in lmics \\n(22)\\n. preterm birth is defined by who as infants born alive before 37 \\nweeks of gestation; an estimated 15 million infants are born preterm worldwide each ye\\nar \\n(7)\\n. health \\ncomplications resulting from preterm birth are the leading cause of death among children < 5 years of \\nage, resulting in over one million deaths in 2016 \\n(7, 23, 24)\\n.\\n \\nlow birth weight is a major public health issue worldwide and is associated \\nwith a range of short\\n-\\n \\nand long\\n-\\nterm health effects. low birth weight is defined by who as a weight at birth of < 2500 g \\n(2)\\n. it has been estimated that 15\\n\\n20% of all infants born worldwide have a low birth weight, \\ncorresponding to more than 20 million bir\\nths per year \\n(3)\\n. sga is commonly defined as having a \\nweight below the 10th percentile of the recommended sex\\n-\\nspecific birth weight for gestational age \\n(10)\\n. sga and low birth weight are also associated with preterm birth \\n(18)\\n. thus, preterm birth and \\nsga \\ncan occur independently or together and can result in low birth weight \\n(18, 25)\\n. these outcomes \\nhave been associated with increased risks for premature death and disability, including cardiovascular \\nmorbidity, chronic lung disease, obesity and metabolic sy\\nndrome \\n(18, 26)\\n. there is also emerging \\nevidence suggestive of an increased risk for developmental delays and poorer cognitive performance \\n(11, 18)\\n. children who had adverse birth outcomes may require more health care after birth, placing \\ndemands on health\\n \\nfacilities and resources, with wider social impacts\\n \\n(18)\\n.\\n \\nthe evidence for links between air pollution and stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight and sga is \\ndiscussed below.\\n \\n \\nstillbirth\\n \\nambient air pollution\\n \\nseveral studies have been published on the\\n \\neffect of aap, particularly pm\\n2.5\\n, and stillbirth. in a meta\\n-\\n \\nanalysis \\n(27)\\n, one study on the effect of \\npm\\n2.5 \\non risk of stillbirth found a statistically nonsignificant \\n\\n3\\n \\nincrease in pm\\n2.5 \\n(28)\\n. green and colleagu\\nes identified a \\nsmall, statistically significant increase in risk per \\n10 µg/m\\n3\\n \\nincrease in pm\\n2.5 \\nin a birth cohort in \\ncalifornia, usa \\n(\\n29)\\n. other studies reported modest increased risks associated with exposure to \\npm\\n2.5 \\nthroughout pregnancy \\n(30) \\nor at specific stages, such as the third trimester \\n(31) \\nor the week \\nbefore delivery \\n(32)\\n. ebisu and colleagues \\n(33) \\nrecommended that the chemical components of pm\\n2.5 \\nand the specific cause of stillbirths (fetal growth, maternal complications) be determined\\n \\nto ensure \\naccurate\\n \\nresults.\\n \\n44\\n \\n \\nother studies have reported increased risks of stillbirth with exposure to total aap \\n(34)\\n, pm\\n2.5 \\n(30)\\n, \\npm\\n10 \\n(30, 35, 36)\\n, \\nco \\n(28, \\n30)\\n, \\nso\\n2 \\n(28, 30\\n, 36)\\n, \\nno\\n2 \\n(28\\n\\n30\\n) \\nand o\\n3 \\n(29, 37)\\n. some publications\\n \\nreported nonsignificant or no associations \\n(38, 39)\\n, and some \\nwere limited by distance at which air \\npollution monitors were located from birth address or by failure to adjust for change of address \\nduring pregnancy \\n(28)\\n. the strongest effect for pm\\n10\\n, \\nso\\n2\\n, \\nco, and o\\n3 \\nin most studies was in the \\nthird trimester \\n(29, 30, 35, 36, 40)\\n. as for pm\\n2.5\\n, evidence indicates that exposure to no\\n2 \\nthroughout \\npregnancy increases the risk of stillbirth \\n(\\n29,\\n \\n30)\\n.\\n \\nacute exposure to aap in the week before delivery has been the\\n \\nsubject of relatively few studies. \\nnew evidence suggests that such exposure increases the risk of stillbirth. faiz and colleagues \\n(32) \\nfound an increased risk of stillbirth when mothers were exposed to high levels of \\nco\\n, \\nso\\n2\\n, \\nno\\n2 \\nor \\npm\\n2.5 \\nin the 6 days be\\nfore delivery. \\nin a retrospective cohort study of 223 375 births in the usa, \\nexposure to o\\n3 \\nduring the week before delivery increased the risk of stillbirth by 13\\n\\n22% \\n(37)\\n.\\n \\nhousehold air pollution\\n \\npope et al. \\n(41) \\nidentified four studies of the relation b\\netween hap from solid fuel use and stillbirth: \\nthree in india \\n(42\\n\\n44) \\nand one in pakistan \\n(45)\\n. three of the studies found a significant association \\nbetween exposure to hap and increased risk of stillbirth; the fourth found an increased risk, which \\nwas not\\n \\nstatistically significant. the review \\n(41) \\nfound an overall 51% increase in risk of stillbirth \\nwith exposure to hap. the studies differed in design, particularly with respect to the method for \\nexposure assessment. two of the studies considered kerosene to\\n \\n\\n(43, 44), \\nand one considered that exposure to kerosene led to medium exposure to hap \\n(45)\\n, which  \\ncontradicts current understanding of the adverse health effects of kerosene. who guidelines for \\nindoor air quality associated with \\nhousehold fuel combustion \\n(46) \\ndiscourage use of kerosene in the \\nhome. the review of health effects for the guidelines concluded that the findings of these four studies \\nwere consistent and that a causal association was possible but could not be confirmed, \\ngiven the  \\nsmall number of studies. a more recent review \\n(47) \\nincluded an additional study and found a 29% \\nincrease in the risk of stillbirth but found that kerosene was categorized inconsistently in the studies, \\n\\n\\n(48) \\n\\n(43, 49)\\n; in \\ntwo studies, information on kerosene use was not collected. different classification of kerosene may \\naffect the interpretation of these results and also the findings of studies on other health\\n \\neff\\nects.\\n \\n \\n \\npreterm birth\\n \\nambient air pollution\\n \\nmaternal exposure to individual air pollutants during pregnancy has been linked with preterm birth \\n(8, 9, 14)\\n. a number of studies have found a positive association between maternal exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nand preterm birth \\n(50\\n\\n52)\\n, and it has even been estimated that, in 2010, 2.7\\n\\n3.4 million preterm \\nbirths globally were associated with exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nduring gestation \\n(53)\\n. one review found a \\nnonsignificant association between exposure to pm\\n10 \\nand preter\\nm birth \\n(52)\\n. preterm birth has been \\nconsistently associated with so\\n2 \\nlevels \\n(54, 55)\\n, while the evidence for associations with co, no, \\nno\\n2 \\nand o\\n3 \\nremains inconclusive \\n(50,\\n \\n53)\\n.\\n \\nit is important to distinguish between very early and later preterm birth (e.g\\n. before 26 weeks, 26\\n\\n32 \\nweeks and after 32 weeks), because each has different effects on health and probably different causes. \\nmany studies do not distinguish between very early and later preterm birth, although this distinction \\nwould be useful, particula\\nrly for evaluating the effects of different levels of aap.\\n \\nhousehold air pollution\\n \\nvery few studies have been undertaken of hap and preterm birth. a systematic review by amegah \\nand colleagues \\n(47) \\ncovered three studies \\n(44, 49, 56) \\nand found an increased risk \\nof preterm birth \\nwith household solid fuel use. \\none of the studies \\n(44)\\n, conducted in india, gave an adjusted odds ratio \\nof 1.43 for preterm birth in houses in which solid fuel was used as compared with those in which \\nlpg or ker\\nosene was used. the literature review for the who guidelines on indoor air quality \\nassociated with household fuel combustion did not include an assessment of the quality of the \\nevidence for associations between polluting fuel use and preterm birth, because\\n \\nof the small number \\nof studies \\n(46)\\n.\\n \\n45\\n \\n \\nbox 6. air pollution and congenital anomalies\\n \\ncongenital anomalies, also known as birth defects, are structural or functional abnormalities that occur during \\nintrauterine life \\n(57). \\nthey may be identi\\nfied before birth, at birth or later in life. congenital anomalies, \\nincluding metabolic disorders, account for an estimated 11% of global neonatal deaths, 6% of infant deaths and \\nlifelong morbidity \\n(24)\\n. examples of congenital anomalies linked to environme\\nntal factors include congenital \\nheart disease, limb reduction, kidney or urinary tract malformation, cleft lip and palate defects, cryptorchidism \\nand hypospadias. while there is evidence that certain birth defects are associated with exposure of nonsmoking\\n \\npregnant women to second\\n-\\nhand tobacco smoke, the results of studies of aap and hap have been inconsistent.\\n \\nthere is a growing body of literature on the relations between aap and congenital anomalies, and associations \\nof varying strength have been found. \\na cohort study conducted in wuhan, china \\n(58)\\n, found a significant \\nassociation between maternal exposure to atmospheric pm\\n2.5 \\nduring early pregnancy and congenital heart \\ndefects in the offspring. this study of 105 988 live births, stillbirths and fetal \\ndeaths was based on 1\\n-\\nweek \\naverage concentrations from nearby air pollution monitors and showed a significant association with risk of \\ncongenital heart defects, which increased monotonically as pm\\n2.5 \\nconcentration increased. a study of traffic \\npollutants (\\npm\\n10 \\nand benzene) in a community in northern italy showed an association between exposure to \\npm\\n10 \\nand birth defects \\n(59)\\n. a systematic review of 10 epidemiological studies that included a meta\\n-\\nanalysis of \\nfour studies of associations between the risk of co\\nngenital anomalies and concentrations of various air \\npollutants found statistically significant increased risks of coarctation of the aorta and of tetralogy of fallot with \\nexposure to no\\n2 \\nand so\\n2 \\n(60)\\n. it also showed an association between exposure to pm\\n10\\n \\nand an increased risk of \\natrial septic defects. another systematic review and meta\\n-\\nanalysis showed a significant association between \\nexposure to no\\n2 \\nand coarctation of the aorta\\n \\n(61)\\n.\\n \\nbecause of the paucity of studies, there is insufficient evidence of an\\n \\nassociation between congenital anomalies \\nand hap other than tobacco smoke. a population\\n-\\nbased case\\n\\ncontrol study in shanxi province, china \\n(62) \\non \\nthe link between neural tube defects and hap from coal combustion demonstrated a dose\\n\\nresponse trend, \\nwhereb\\n\\ncombustion pollutants.\\n \\n \\n \\nlow birth weight\\n \\nambient air pollution\\n \\nevidence has emerged in the past decade that ambient pm affects birth weight \\n(5, 6, 15\\n\\n1\\n7, 63)\\n. \\nseveral meta\\n-\\nanalyses performed between 2012 and 2016 consistently showed positive associations \\nbetween exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nduring pregnancy and low birth weight and suggest that late pregnancy \\nmay be a critically vulnerable time \\n(50, 52, 64\\n\\n66)\\n.\\n \\nind\\nividual chemical elements of pm may be involved in its toxic effect. in a large study of eight \\npooled european cohorts, an increased amount of sulfur in pm\\n2.5 \\nwas associated with an increased \\nrisk of low birth weight \\n(17)\\n. as the chemical components of pm \\ndiffer widely by source, this may \\nexplain some of the inconsistencies in the findings of different studies \\n(64)\\n. in an extensive \\nsystematic review of studies in china \\n(55)\\n, so\\n2 \\nwas consistently associated with low birth weight. \\nthere is less evidence of as\\nsociations between exposure during pregnancy to pm\\n10\\n, pah (benzene, \\ntoluene, ethyl benzene, m\\n-\\n \\nand p\\n-\\nxylene, and o\\n-\\nxylene) and other elements of aap, such as co and \\nno\\n2\\n, and low birth weight \\n(4, 52,\\n \\n65)\\n.\\n \\n \\nhousehold air pollution\\n \\nseveral studies have tested the association between hap, particularly from use of solid fuels, and a \\nlower mean birth weight. these studies found an increased risk of low birth weight between 21% and \\n35% with exposure to hap \\n(25, 41, 47, 67, 68)\\n.\\n \\nthe revie\\nw of health effects for the 2014 who guidelines led to the conclusion that there \\nwas \\nmoderate evidence of an association between exposure to solid fuel combustion and low birth weight \\n(46)\\n. the review comprised seven studies, which had consistent findings \\n(44, 49, 69\\n\\n73)\\n. an earlier \\nreview by pope and colleagues \\n(41) \\nincluded many of the same studies from guatemala, india, \\npakistan and zimbabwe, all of which reported higher risks of low birth weight after maternal \\nexposure to solid fuel combustion in the ho\\nme. the review found that maternal exposure to hap \\nincreased the risk of low birth weight by 38%, for an average reduction in birth weight of 96.6 g. a \\nrecent systematic review by amegah and colleagues \\n(47) \\nfound a 35% increase in risk and an average \\nreduc\\ntion in birth weight of 54 g, after adjustment for publication\\n \\nbias.\\n \\n46\\n \\n \\nbox 7. air pollution and adverse birth outcomes: new evidence from cohort studies in india\\n \\nair pollution is one of the leading risk factors for the national burden of di\\nsease in india \\n(74)\\n. exposure to \\npm\\n2.5 \\nin aap and hap has been associated with low birth weight in many studies but in few studies in the \\nhigh\\n-\\nexposure settings that are common in lmics such as india. balakrishnan et al. \\n(75) \\ninvestigated whether \\nexposure \\nto pm\\n2.5 \\nduring pregnancy was associated with low birth weight in an integrated rural\\n\\nurban, mother\\n\\n \\nchild cohort in tamil nadu. the researchers recruited 1285 women in the first trimester of pregnancy in \\nprimary health care centres and urban health posts \\nand followed them until the birth of their child to collect data \\non maternal health, prenatal care, exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and the birthweight of the child. \\n\\n3\\n \\nincrease in exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nduring pregnancy was a\\nssociated with a decrease in \\nbirth weight of 4 g and a 2% increase in the prevalence of low birth weight (after adjustment for gestational  \\nage, sex, maternal bmi, maternal age, history of a previous low\\n-\\nbirth\\n-\\nweight child, birth order and season of \\nconcep\\ntion). by applying the exposure\\n\\nresponse estimates of the median differences in pm\\n2.5  \\nconcentration\\n \\n(of\\n \\n\\n3\\n) between households in which biomass and clean fuel were used, a 70 g decrease in birth weight \\nwas\\n \\nestimated\\n \\nto\\n \\nbe\\n \\nassociated\\n \\nwith\\n \\nsolid\\n \\nfuel\\n \\nuse\\n \\n(76)\\n.\\n \\nthis\\n \\nstudy\\n \\nprovided\\n \\nsome\\n \\nof\\n \\nthe\\n \\nfirst\\n \\nquantitative\\n \\nestimates of the effects of exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nin india to birth weight. it contributed evidence of this association \\nthat is relevant for high\\n-\\nexposure settings in lmics that experience the d\\nual health burdens of aap and hap. \\nthe findings indicate that maternal exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nshould be considered with other risk factors for low \\nbirthweight in india. the study also provided baseline information for a new multi\\n-\\ncountry hap intervention \\ntrial \\nunder way in guatemala, india, peru and rwanda on the effects of clean fuel (in this case, lpg) use on \\nmaternal and child health \\n(\\nwww.hapintrial.org\\n).\\n \\n \\n \\nsmall for gestational age\\n \\nambient air pollution\\n \\nfew studies have explored the association between exposure to air pollution and infants born small \\nfor gestational age (sga), defined as \\nbirth weight below \\n\\n \\n2 standard deviations of the mean or \\nbelow the 10th percentile according to local intrauterine gro\\nwth charts \\n(77)\\n. maternal exposure to \\npm\\n2.5 \\nand pm\\n10 \\nhas been associated with sga births \\n(15, 50)\\n. le and colleagues \\n(8) \\ninvestigated the \\nassociation between sga at term and exposure to so\\n2\\n, co, no\\n2\\n, o\\n3 \\nand pm\\n10 \\nduring the first month \\nand the third trimest\\ner of pregnancy. they found an association between sga at term and exposure \\nto high co and no\\n2 \\nlevels in the first month and with exposure to o\\n3 \\nand pm\\n10 \\n\\n3\\n \\nduring  \\nthe third trimester. additional evidence confirms the link between elevated no\\n2 \\nlev\\nels and sga. a \\nstudy of 2.5 million births in canada between 1999 and 2008 found that exposure to no\\n2 \\nduring \\npregnancy was significantly associated with infants born sga at term. the association was \\nindependent of pm\\n2.5\\n, and a dose\\n\\nresponse relation was fo\\nund. this information and evidence that \\nno\\n2 \\nis a key component of traffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution led the authors to suggest that exposure to \\ntraffic is an important factor in adverse pregnancy outcomes such as sga\\n \\n(54)\\n.\\n \\nsocial situation strongly affects bir\\nth outcome. a population\\n-\\nbased study in the usa linked exposure \\nto both \\no\\n3 \\nand pm\\n2.5 \\nto sga. the authors noted that more socially disadvantaged populations are at \\ngreater risk of infants born sga, particularly \\nin the case of exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\n(12)\\n. overall, there is \\ngrowing evidence of an association between sga and ambient air pollution.\\n \\nhousehold air pollution\\n \\nassociations between hap and infants born sga have been identified in several studies. in india, \\ninfants born to women who used biomass fu\\nels such as \\nwood and/or dung as the primary cooking fuel \\nin the home during pregnancy were more likely to be sga \\n(44)\\n. in a study of pregnant women in \\nzambia, household air monitors were used to measure exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nand volatile organic \\ncompounds duri\\nng the first trimester \\n(78)\\n. the authors found that increasing levels of pollutants were \\nassociated with poor birth outcomes, and both pm\\n2.5 \\nand vocs were associated with sga. the \\nprimary sources of pollution identified were biomass fuels (wood, charcoal, \\ncrop residues and cow \\ndung) used for cooking. garbage burning was also common.\\n \\n \\nbiological mechanisms\\n \\nit is difficult to determine the association between air pollution and adverse birth outcomes because \\nso\\n \\nmany\\n \\nfactors\\n \\ncan\\n \\ninfluence\\n \\nthe\\n \\nsensitive\\n \\nperiods\\n \\nof\\n \\ndevelopment.\\n \\nseveral\\n \\nplausible\\n \\nmechanisms\\n \\n47\\n \\n \\nhave been proposed, including oxidative stress, which m\\nay affect the embryo directly in its early \\nstages of development or induce dna damage, pulmonary and placental inflammation, changes in \\nfetal blood coagulation or endothelial function, and altered maternal haemodynamic response \\n(79)\\n.\\n \\nthe placenta is centra\\nl to the health of the fetus, and airborne pollutants that reach the placenta may \\ncause significant damage. pahs and co can cross the placenta, triggering a number of effects \\n(63, \\n80)\\n. researchers found that maternal exposure to fine particulate matter (pm\\n2.5\\n) and co in household \\nair during pregnancy increases the risk of fetal thrombotic vasculopathy, a disorder characterized by \\nclots on the fetal surface of the placenta that block vascular flow, and also stillbirth and low birth \\nweight \\n(81)\\n.\\n \\nstudies ha\\nve identified epigenetic changes in the expression of maternal and fetal dna in cases in \\nwhich air pollution has been indicated as a factor in preterm birth, suggesting a new mechanism of \\naction \\n(82)\\n. increased methylation of umbilical cord blood and place\\nntal dna has been noted, \\nalthough more research is needed \\n(82)\\n. studies in experimental animals showed that high maternal \\nexposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nduring pregnancy can cause epigenetic changes that interfere with the cerebral \\ndevelopment of the embryo \\n(83)\\n.\\n \\npm ca\\nn also stimulate maternal inflammatory responses, reduce maternal immunity and increase the \\nrisk of infection \\n(84)\\n. infection may cause intrauterine growth restriction or preterm labour \\n(84)\\n. \\nmaternal health is critical to fetal health; therefore, if the m\\n\\nby air pollutants\\n, the transport and delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus may be reduced\\n \\n(85)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nbox 8. clarion call: the figo opinion on the effects of exposure to toxic environmental chemicals on \\nreproductive health.\\n \\n\\n\\nobstetrics (figo), th\\ne leading voice of reproductive health professionals, with member societies in 125 \\ncountries and territories. in 2015, figo published an opinion by an international group of obstetricians, \\ngynaecologists and scientists, formally endorsed or supported by 12\\n \\nreproductive health professional \\norganizations worldwide \\n(86)\\n\\n\\nexposure to \\n\\nopinion states. figo recommends that health professionals advocate for policies to prevent exposure to toxic \\nchemicals in the environment, including air\\n \\npollution.\\n \\n \\n \\nconclusions\\n \\npregnancy is a highly vulnerable time. a growing body of evidence shows a link between exposure  \\nto air pollution and adverse birth outcomes, which may have lasting health consequences. there is \\nrobust evidence that exposure to air pollution\\n, especially ambient pm, is associated with low birth \\nweight. likewise, there is growing evidence that maternal exposure to aap, especially to fine pm, \\nincreases the risk of preterm birth. while the reported strength of association between stillbirth and \\ne\\nxposure to air pollutants (e.g. pm, co) depends on the individual pollutant, several studies have \\nshown an increased risk of stillbirth linked to higher exposures. there is evidence suggestive of a link \\nbetween exposure to ambient and household air polluti\\non and infants born sga. while additional \\nresearch will advance knowledge, the harmful effects of air pollution on fetal development and birth \\nare clear, and efforts must be made to protect future\\n \\ngenerations.\\n \\n \\n \\nknowledge gaps and research needs\\n \\n \\na substant\\nial number of studies have examined the link between air pollution and various birth \\noutcomes. the studies differ widely in the populations studied, the method and the levels of \\nexposure to air\\n \\npollution.\\n\\n \\nmore studies should be conducted on the association\\n \\nbetween exposure to ultrafine pm and birth \\noutcomes and also on exposure to air pollution and preterm\\n \\nbirth.\\n\\n \\nas many studies on birth outcomes and air pollution are based on general estimates of exposure, \\nstudies\\n \\nshould\\n \\nbe\\n \\nconducted\\n

mortality have \\nprovided compelling evidence of a positive association\\n \\nglobally.\\n\\n \\nmost studies have addressed acute exposure to aap with relatively few on the effects of \\nhap \\non the risk of infant\\n \\nmortality.\\n\\n \\n \\ninfant mortality refers to deaths that occur in the first year of life. in 2016, the global infant mortality \\nwas 4.2 million, rep\\nresenting 75% of all deaths of children under the age of 5 years \\n(1)\\n. while many \\nstudies have shown a link between air pollution and mortality in adults, less research has been done \\n\\nre particularly vulnerable to \\nairborne exposure, and more research is required. the available evidence indicates a link between \\ninfant mortality and exposure to hap and aap. the links between climate change, air pollution and \\ninfant and child health are al\\nso increasingly being studied, with growing concern for the health and \\nwell\\n-\\nbeing of future generations\\n \\n(2)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nambient air pollution\\n \\nearly studies of the effect of aap on infant mortality consistently found associations of different \\nstrengths. several stud\\nies included in a systematic review in 2005 \\n(3) \\nfound strong correlations\\n \\n52\\n \\n \\nbetween air pollution and infant mortality. the studies were conducted in many geographic areas, on \\na range of pollutants, including total suspended particles: so\\n2\\n,\\n \\no\\n3\\n, no\\n2\\n, no\\nx\\n, pm\\n2.5 \\nand pm\\n10\\n. a \\nsimilar review in 2004 found that the results differed by subgroup of infants \\n(4)\\n. while inconsistent \\nfindings were noted for pm and both total infant mortality and neonatal mortality, the authors found a \\npositive associati\\non between exposure to pm and post\\n-\\nneonatal mortality. this was especially \\npronounced for deaths due to respiratory causes and sudden infant death syndrome. although the \\nreason for this trend was not clear, the authors suggested links between exposure to p\\narticulate air \\npollution and some causes of infant\\n \\ndeath.\\n \\nseveral studies examined the effects of aap on infant mortality in more detail. a large study in \\njapan was conducted of infant deaths in urban tokyo between 2002 and 2013 to examine the \\nassociati\\non with acute exposure to pm\\n2.5\\n, suspended pm (< 7 µm in diameter) and coarse particles \\n(pm\\n7\\n\\n2.5\\n) \\n(5)\\n. the mortality rates associated with increases in the concentration of each pollutant of \\n\\n3 \\nwere compared. infant mortality was categorized by age a\\nt death (infant, neonate and post\\n-\\n \\nneonate) and cause of death. infant and post\\n-\\n\\n3 \\nincrease in pm\\n2.5 \\nand was linked with respiratory diseases. an increase in exposure to coarse particles \\nwas associated with a 2\\n1% increase in the risk of post\\n-\\nneonatal mortality; and the risks of post\\n-\\n \\nneonatal mortality and mortality due to respiratory diseases increased by 10% and 25%, respectively, \\nwith increased concentrations of suspended pm. the risk of infant mortality was \\nincreased even \\nwhen pm concentrations were below the japanese air quality guideline of a daily average of 35  \\nµg/m\\n3\\n \\nfor pm\\n2.5\\n. these results highlight the importance of evaluating infants separately from other \\nage groups, as they may be uniquely susceptibl\\ne to air\\n \\npollution.\\n \\na study with satellite estimates and data from household surveys on the location and timing of almost \\n1 million births in 30 countries in africa was conducted to estimate the effect of exposure to ambient \\npm\\n2.5 \\non infant mortality \\n(6)\\n. \\nthe authors found that infant mortality increased by 9% with a 10 \\n\\n3\\n \\nincrease in pm\\n2.5 \\nand estimated that exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nabove minimum threshold levels was \\nresponsible for 22% of infant deaths in those 30 countries in\\n \\n2015.\\n \\nin an affluent, densely po\\npulated area of flanders, belgium in close proximity to traffic, industry and \\nagriculture, researchers investigated acute exposure to pm\\n10 \\nand infant mortality between 1998 and \\n2006 \\n(7)\\n. daily infant mortality, pollutant level and cause of death were recor\\nded. neonates aged 2\\n\\n4 \\nweeks were the most vulnerable to air pollution, with an 11% higher risk of death with every increase \\n\\n3\\n \\nin pm\\n10\\n. when pm\\n10 \\n\\n3\\n, these neonates were 1.75 times more \\n\\n3 \\n\\n3 \\non more than 3 days per year (\\n8\\n). thus, adherence to local pollution \\nstandards may significantly affect infant mortality rates. i\\nn this study, infant mortality due to  \\nperinatal circumstances (e.g. maternal conditions, complications of pregnancy and birth, adverse birth \\noutcomes) and congenital and chromosomal abnormalities also increased with rising daily pm\\n10 \\nlevels.\\n \\nmost studies \\n\\nfew considered longer exposures, although the extent of exposure to pollutants in the weeks and \\nmonths before death may be critical. for example, a correlation has been\\n \\nfound between the average \\nlevel of pm\\n2.5 \\nduring the time between birth and post\\n-\\nneonatal death \\n(9)\\n. in a study in a highly \\npolluted part of california, usa, the average co, no\\n2\\n, o\\n3 \\nand pm\\n10 \\nlevels experienced by infants 2 \\nweeks and 1, 2 and 6 months befor\\ne death were measured \\n(10)\\n. in infants 28 days to 3 months old, \\nthe risk of death from respiratory causes increased significantly with rising co levels in the 2 weeks \\nbefore death; a moderate increase in risk was seen for infants 4\\n\\n12 months old with incre\\nasing pm\\n10 \\nlevels in the 2 weeks before death; and, for infants 7\\n\\n12 months old, the risk more than doubled when \\nthey had been exposed to high levels of pm\\n10 \\nin the 6 months before death. in another study in the \\nsame region, the risk of sudden infant death\\n \\nsyndrome increased by 15\\n\\n19% when average no\\n2  \\nlevels were elevated during the 2 months before death \\n(11)\\n. in a cohort study in the republic of \\nkorea of the association between long\\n-\\nterm exposure, including during pregnancy and postnatally, to \\npm and infa\\nnt mortality \\n(12)\\n, gestational exposure to increasing levels of pm\\n10, \\ntotal suspended \\nparticulates and pm\\n2.5 \\nincreased the risk of infant mortality from all causes and from respiratory \\ncauses in infants with a normal birth weight. the first trimester was t\\nhe only period during which this \\npattern was found independently, indicating an effect of air pollution in early pregnancy on infant \\ndevelopment and mortality.\\n \\n53\\n \\n \\npolicy affects human health and perhaps most significantly that of infants. in\\n \\na quasi\\n-\\nexperiment, \\ntanaka \\n(13) \\nstudied changes in infant mortality in 175 chinese prefectures before and after the \\nintroduction of stringent air pollution regulations. in 1998, the power industry, which was heavily \\nreliant on coal and a major source of e\\nmissions (particularly so\\n2\\n), dramatically reduced its emissions. \\nthis reduction was associated with a 20% decrease in the rate of infant mortality, with a 63% \\nreduction during the neonatal period, particularly from deaths associated with the nervous and \\nci\\nrculatory systems. the author proposed that the drastic improvement in neonatal survival with \\nreduced maternal exposure to pollutants benefitted fetal development and increased probability of \\nsurvival.\\n \\n \\n \\nhousehold air pollution\\n \\nmost of the research on \\nhap\\n \\nhas been on the effects of ambient air pollutants, although infants spend \\nmost of their time indoors. in a study in rural india, the risk of infant mortality was 21% higher in \\nhouseholds with indoor burning of biomass fuels (wood or dung) than in those in\\n \\nwhich kerosene or \\nbiogas was used \\n(14)\\n. in ecuador, the infant mortality rate increased with the amount of biomass \\nfuels burnt \\n(15)\\n. in these studies, households in which biomass fuels were used were compared with \\nthose in which fuels considered by the au\\n\\nused. (as noted above, this categorization contradicts current understanding of the adverse health \\nimpacts of kerosene use.) in another study, infants born to women exposed to polluting cooking fuel\\ns \\n(kerosene, charcoal, coal, wood, straw, crop waste and dung) during pregnancy were found to be at \\nincreased risk of neonatal mortality within 0\\n\\n2 days of birth \\n(16)\\n, indicating the danger of exposure \\nto hap both in utero and in the domestic\\n \\nenvironment.\\n \\n \\n \\nbiological mechanisms\\n \\nthe biological mechanisms through which air pollution increases infant mortality are not clearly \\nunderstood. it has been proposed that infants are likely to die when exposed to air pollution because \\ntheir immature lungs and immune s\\nystem leave them unable to cope with the reactive inflammation \\nthat occurs in response to such exposure \\n(17)\\n. pope et al. \\n(18) \\nproposed that pm damages the lung, \\nresulting in respiratory distress and hypoxaemia. neonatal rats exposed to pm had reduced cell\\n \\nproliferation and increased oxidative stress in the lungs \\n(19)\\n, but toxicological evidence for humans is \\nlacking. co poisoning is a well\\n-\\nknown cause of infant death \\n(20)\\n.\\n \\nthe association between exposure to pm and adverse birth outcomes, including low bir\\nth weight, \\npreterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction, is relevant to infant mortality. the possible \\nmechanisms of these outcomes have been studied in more detail. they may include adverse effects  \\non the cardiovascular system, such as oxidative \\nstress, inflammation, impaired coagulation and \\nendothelial function and faulty haemodynamic responses \\n(21)\\n. these adverse effects add to the \\nchallenges faced by vulnerable infants as they grow and develop during their first year of\\n \\nlife.\\n \\n \\n \\nconclusion\\n \\na cor\\nrelation has been found between exposure to hap and aap and infant mortality, which \\nincreases with increasing pollution levels. infants are at particular risk from exposure to pm and toxic \\ngases. although inconsistent classification of kerosene in studies \\nof hap and infant mortality may \\naffect the interpretation of certain findings, hap is clearly a risk factor for child mortality.\\n \\n \\nknowledge gaps and research needs\\n \\n \\nmost of the studies addressed acute exposure, and more research is needed to understand the \\nlong\\n-\\nterm cumulative effects of air pollution, from gestation to\\n \\ndeath.\\n\\n \\nfew studies to date have been conducted on hap. better understanding of the effects of indoor \\npollutants on infant mortality will improve understanding of the interaction between expos\\nures \\nand risk. studies of the different constituents of air pollution and the biological mechanisms by \\nwhich they act will improve understanding of how air pollution affects infant\\n \\nmortality.\\n\\n54\\n \\n \\n \\nalthough sufficient data are available to supp\\nort preventive action, further research on the \\ncomponents of air pollution and their mechanisms of action would provide input for additional \\npreventive policy actions and\\n \\ninterventions.\\n\\n \\n \\nreferences \\n\\n \\ninfant mortality\\n \\n \\n1.\\n \\nlevels and trends in child mortality.\\n \\nreport 2017. estimates developed

resulting in lower cognitive \\ntest outcomes (such as global intelligence quotient) and the development of behavioural \\ndisorders such as autism spectrum and attention deficit hyperactivity\\n \\ndisorders.\\n\\n \\nresearch suggests that both prenatal and\\n \\npostnatal exposure to air pollution represent threats to \\nneurodevelopment.\\n\\n \\noverview\\n \\nneurodevelopment is a fundamental phase of human growth and development, which begins in the \\nearly prenatal period with the proliferation of radial glia and neurons. whi\\nle neurodevelopment \\ncontinues well into the second decade of life, the first three years of age are especially important. \\nvarious processes occur during this period, including proliferation, migration, differentiation, \\nsynaptogenesis, myelination and apopt\\nosis of neuronal cells \\n(1, 2)\\n. if neurodevelopment  is \\ninterrupted or impaired by environmental pollutants, the health consequences for the child can be \\nserious, as this may lead to a number of conditions and symptoms, including cognitive impairment, \\natten\\ntion disorders and autism spectrum disorder, which are difficult to diagnose and treat and may \\nhave lifelong\\n \\nconsequences.\\n \\nambient air pollution\\n \\nthree systematic reviews concluded that there is an association between exposure to aap, especially \\npollutants \\nemitted from vehicles, and impaired neurodevelopment in children \\n(2\\n\\n4)\\n.\\n \\nseveral studies have evaluated the relation between prenatal exposure to air pollution and \\nneurodevelopment in children and suggested that air pollution can negatively affect their men\\ntal and \\nmotor development. lertxundi et al. \\n(5) \\nfound that prenatal exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nand no\\n2 \\nwas  \\n\\nthe age of 15 months. in a study of birth cohorts in the r\\nepublic of korea, prenatal exposure to pm\\n10 \\nand no\\n2 \\nhad significant effects on cognitive development and motor development at 6 months of age \\nbut not at 12 or 24 months\\n \\n(6)\\n.\\n \\nthe findings of studies on the effects of prenatal exposure to air pollution on co\\ngnitive function and \\nbehaviour have been inconsistent \\n(2)\\n. while one meta\\n-\\nanalysis of cohort studies in europe found no \\nassociation between cognitive development and exposure to no\\n2 \\nand pm from traffic\\n-\\nrelated air \\npollution, an association was seen between\\n \\nprenatal exposure to no\\n2 \\nand deficits in overall \\npsychomotor function in children aged 1\\n\\n6 years \\n(7, 8)\\n.\\n \\nprenatal exposure to air pollutants can have various effects on development throughout childhood. in \\njapan, yorifuji and colleagues \\n(9) \\nreported an association between prenatal exposure to air pollution \\nand deficits in verbal and fine motor development at the age of 2.5 years. they also found an \\nassociation with problems of attention, inhibition and impulsivity at 5.5 years. in the same co\\nhort, the \\nrisks of attention problems and aggressive behaviour were found to have increased by 8 years of age \\n(10)\\n. other studies indicate that exposure in specific periods during pregnancy is associated with \\ncertain stages of neurodevelopmental deficit, w\\nith differences by gender. chiu et al. \\n(11) \\nreported an \\nassociation between exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nat 31\\n\\n38 weeks of gestational age and reduced intelligence \\nquotient among boys and an association between exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nat 12\\n\\n20 weeks of gestational age \\nand \\ndecreased general memory index among girls.\\n \\nwhere children live and grow has a powerful effect on their lives. there is increasing evidence that, \\npostnatally, childhood exposure to traffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution is linked to neurodevelopmental \\noutcomes such\\n \\nas anxiety and depression \\n(12) \\nand impaired cognitive function \\n(13, 14)\\n. in a study of \\n2715 children aged 7\\n\\n10 years in barcelona, spain, sunyer and colleagues \\n(15) \\nfound that children \\nwho attended schools in highly polluted areas had slower growth in cog\\nnitive function, measured as \\nworking memory, than those in less polluted areas.\\n \\nin a prospective study of birth cohort, suglia et al. \\n(16) \\nused black carbon as an indicator of traffic\\n-\\n \\nrelated air pollution and found that increased exposure was associated \\nwith lower scores on \\nintelligence, memory and learning tests in children aged 8\\n\\n11 years. in a one\\n-\\nyear longitudinal study \\nin spain, freire et al. \\n(17) \\nobserved that high exposure to traffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution was associated \\nwith a modest decrease in co\\ngnitive and motor development. a longitudinal study in spain showed \\nthat students exposed to higher levels of traffic\\n-\\nrelated no\\n2\\n\\n\\n \\nand negative\\n \\n56\\n \\n \\nperformance on tests of working memory and attentiveness than those exposed to lower levels. in \\nanother longitudinal study, chiu et al. \\n(18) \\nfound a nonlinear relation between exposure to air \\npollution and attention in child\\nren aged 7\\n\\n14. they also found that children in the second and third \\nquartile of exposure to black carbon made more errors and had a slower reaction time on a  \\ncontinuous performance task than those in the lowest quartile, although the association was less\\n \\nstrong for those in the highest quartile. significant associations were found for both boys and girls, \\nbut stronger associations were found for\\n \\nboys.\\n \\nin the first large study of the effect of air pollution on brain morphology, guxens et al. \\n(19) \\nanalysed \\nbrain imaging scans and cognitive function tests of 783 children in a dutch birth cohort. prenatal \\nexposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nwas found to cause structural alterations to the cerebral cortex, which partially \\nmediates inhibitory control, of children age 6\\n\\n10 years. \\nimpaired ability to control impulses at this \\nage may affect educational achievement and increase the risk of mental disorders.\\n \\nhousehold air pollution\\n \\nthe review of evidence

found to be lower in those who were exposed t\\no open\\n-\\nfire cooking \\n(22)\\n. the reviewers \\nconcluded that, while research to date suggests a relation between exposure to hap and impaired \\ncognitive development, no clear association could be concluded from two studies. indoor exposure to \\nco from cooking with\\n \\ngas or solid fuels may be independently associated with adverse \\nneurodevelopmental outcomes in children \\n(23)\\n, but this conclusion is also based on a limited number \\nof studies.\\n \\n \\n \\nautism spectrum disorders\\n \\nautism spectrum disorders

postnatal exposure to traffic\\n-\\nrelated \\nair pollution and asd in children. becerra et al. \\n(12) \\nreported an increased risk of asd with \\nincreasing prenatal exposure to no\\nx\\n, o\\n3\\n, and pm\\n2.5 \\nin los angeles, california, citing traffic as the \\nprimary source \\n(12)\\n. three other studies found associations, with an increased risk of asd and pre\\n-\\n \\nand postnatal exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\n(13, 14, 25)\\n, pm\\n10\\n, no\\n2 \\nand traffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution \\n(14)\\n. in a \\np\\nrospective cohort study, jung and colleagues \\n(26) \\nidentified an increased risk of asd with rising \\nlevels of co, no\\n2\\n, o\\n3 \\nand so\\n2 \\nin the 1\\n\\n4 years before diagnosis. in a systematic review of 23  \\nstudies, lam et al. \\n(27) \\nfound an increased risk of autism with\\n \\nincreased exposure to air pollution but \\nrated the quality of the evidence as moderate, with a low risk of bias. they concluded that there is \\nlimited evidence of\\n \\ntoxicity.\\n \\nin contrast, two studies in europe found no association between autistic traits and \\nprenatal exposure \\nto no\\n2\\n, pm\\n2.5 \\nor pm\\n10 \\n(28) \\nand no link between pre\\n-\\n \\nand postnatal exposure to no\\nx \\nand pm\\n2.5 \\nand \\nasd \\n(28, 29)\\n. furthermore, a study of birth cohorts in sweden \\n(30) \\nfound no association between \\npre\\n-\\n \\nand postnatal exposure to no\\nx \\nand pm\\n10 \\nan\\nd asd or attention\\n-\\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder, a \\nbrain disorder marked by a continuous pattern of

have shown relatively consistent evidence of \\nan \\nas\\nsociation between aap, especially prenatal exposure to pm, and autism \\n(27, 33\\n\\n36)\\n. more \\nresearch should be conducted to clarify the effects of individual components of aap. there is \\ninconsistent evidence of an association between the critical period of exp\\nosure (pre\\n-\\n \\nor postnatal) and \\nthe occurrence of asd \\n(2, 36,\\n \\n37)\\n.\\n \\n57\\n \\n \\nhousehold air pollution\\n \\nthe review revealed no published studies on hap from use of polluting fuels and the development of \\nasd. asd were not included in the review of the ev\\nidence of health effects for the who guidelines \\non indoor air quality with respect to household fuel combustion in 2014 \\n(20)\\n.\\n \\n \\nbiological mechanisms\\n \\nalthough neurodevelopment is a complex process, studies are beginning to elucidate the mechanisms \\nby wh\\nich air pollution interferes with the normal physiology. a study with magnetic resonance \\nimaging (mri) of children aged 7\\n\\n9 years who had been exposed in utero to pahs showed a \\ndose\\n\\n \\nresponse relation with reductions in white matter surface \\n(38)\\n. the chang\\nes were found almost \\nexclusively in the left hemisphere of the brain and were associated with specific symptoms, including \\nmore severe externalizing behavioural problems, symptoms of \\nattention\\n-\\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder \\nand conduct disorders.\\n \\npujol et \\nal. \\n(39) \\nused mri to document brain structure, membrane metabolites, functional \\nconnectivity in major neural networks and activation/deactivation dynamics during a sensory task. \\nother authors concluded that higher exposure to traffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution \\nin childhood slowed \\nbrain maturation \\n(13)\\n. other research suggests that exposure during fetal life to high levels of air \\npollution causes structural changes in the cerebral cortex \\n(19)\\n.\\n \\nmri also revealed significant differences in white matter volume and c\\nognitive deficits between \\nchildren living in highly polluted areas and those living in less polluted areas \\n(40)\\n. the authors also \\nsaw increased serum inflammatory mediators in these children, suggesting a role for \\nneuroinflammation, and proposed that struc\\ntural brain alterations are a potential response to high \\nlevels of air pollution. \\nother work showed an association between long\\n-\\nterm exposure to air pollution \\n(including ultrafine pm \\nand pm\\n2.5\\n) \\nand neuroinflammation, in addition to an altered innate immune\\n \\nresponse in children and young adults \\n(41)\\n. the authors also noted disruption of the blood\\n\\nbrain \\n\\n-\\n\\n-\\nsynuclein, \\nsuggesting that \\nlong\\n-\\nterm exposure to air pollution should be cons\\nidered a risk factor for degenerative \\ndiseases such as alzheimer and parkinson\\n \\ndiseases.\\n \\n \\nconclusions\\n \\nthere is growing evidence of an association between exposure to aap in the prenatal and postnatal \\nperiods and impaired childhood neurodevelopment. there is strong evidence that exposure to aap \\n\\nthere is suggestive evidence of a \\nlink between prenatal exposure to traffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution and cognitive and psychomotor  \\nfunction and behavioural problems, but the findings have been inconsistent. some studies showed an \\nassociation between exposure\\n \\nto hap and impaired cognitive develoment, but further research is \\nneeded. outdoor air pollution has been linked to an increased risk of asd, especially in studies in the \\nusa in which consistent methods were\\n \\nused.\\n \\n \\nknowledge gaps and research needs\\n \\n \\nfurther\\n \\nresearch should be conducted on the biological pathways of the effects of air pollution \\non neurodevelopment. use of more precise methods for measuring exposure to air pollution, the

between traffic\\n-\\nrelated \\nair pollution and insulin resistance in\\n \\nchildren.\\n\\n \\nair pollution may disrupt the normal development of children, resulting in increased wei\\nght\\n-\\nfor\\n-\\n \\nlength gain and mean bmi and differences in attained bmi at specific ages. potential \\nmechanisms for these effects include regulation of lipid metabolism, fat storage and\\n \\nappetite.\\n\\n \\n\\nt accumulation that may impair \\nhealth, with weight\\n-\\nfor\\n-\\nheight greater than two or three standard deviations above the median who \\nchild growth standard \\n(1)\\n. in practical terms, this means that overweight or obese children are too \\nheavy for their height.\\n \\nchi\\nldhood obesity is increasing worldwide and is now recognized as a major public health challenge \\n(2, 3)\\n. the prevalence of obesity among young people is high in many countries, but the rate of \\nobesity is increasing at a faster rate in developing than in dev\\neloped countries \\n(3, 4)\\n. the problem has \\nreached the proportions of an epidemic: in 2017, 38.3 million children < 5 years and 340 million aged \\n5\\n\\n19 years worldwide were overweight or obese \\n(4 ,5)\\n. childhood obesity is likely to continue into \\nadulthood, wit\\nh increased risks of cardiovascular or metabolic disorders, including diabetes and heart\\n \\n60\\n \\n \\ndisease. increasingly, obese children are presenting with these diseases early in life. the rapid global \\nrise in obesity is due to a variety of facto\\nrs, including overconsumption of energy\\n-\\ndense foods and \\nless physical activity. the environment in which children are raised can also strongly influence their \\nrisk of becoming overweight or obese \\n(6, 7)\\n\\npregn\\nancy must be also be considered. the commission on ending childhood obesity has \\nrecognized the importance of ensuring that pregnant women are protected from environmental \\nhazards to reduce the risk of childhood obesity \\n(3)\\n. there is growing interest among \\nresearchers and \\npolicy\\n-\\nmakers in determining the effects on childhood obesity of environmental conditions such as \\nair pollution\\n \\n(2)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nambient air pollution\\n \\nas indicated in section 5.1, exposure to air pollution in utero may affect birth weight through \\nplacental damage, epigenetic changes and maternal inflammatory responses. longer\\n-\\nterm effects on \\nenergy balance, weight\\n-\\nfor\\n-\\nlength gain and bmi for age in early childhood have also been identified \\nin some studies. in a study of children in the usa, rundle \\net al. \\n(8) \\nreported that prenatal exposure to \\npahs in aap was associated with increased bmi and obesity in childhood. pregnant women in this \\nstudy wore personal air monitoring devices for 2 days during the third trimester of pregnancy. in \\ncomparison with t\\nhe group with lowest exposure, children born to mothers most heavily exposed to \\npah had a higher bmi at 5 and 7 years of age and relative risks of obesity of 1.79 and 2.26, \\nrespectively. adjustment was made for several potentially confounding variables, su\\n\\nsex, ethnicity and birth weight, but did not account for physical activity. fleisch et al. \\n(9) \\nmeasured \\nthe weight and length of infants in the project viva cohort at birth and at 6 months and determined \\nthe association between prenatal e\\nxposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nand black carbon and fetal growth and infant \\nweight gain. infants in the highest quartile of exposure to black carbon in the third trimester had less \\nfetal growth than those in the lowest quartile, and an association was found between expo\\nsure to \\nblack carbon or pm\\n2.5 \\nand weight\\n-\\nfor\\n-\\nlength gain between 0 and 6 months. account was taken of \\npotentially confounding variables, including weight gain, maternal smoking and abnormal glucose \\ntolerance.\\n \\nthere is some evidence that air pollution affects different stages of gestation separately. a cohort \\nstudy was conducted to determine sensitive periods of exposure and sex\\n-\\nspecific effects by modelling \\nthe day and week of exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nduring pregnancy\\n \\n(10)\\n. exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nduring 10\\n\\n29 weeks \\nof gestation resulted in increased waist\\n\\nhip ratios in girls at the age of 4 years. exposure in weeks 8\\n\\n \\n17 and 15\\n\\n22 of gestation increased the bmi z score and fat mass in boys at the age of 4 years. \\nstudies in \\nexperimental animals also indicate specific differences. a study in rodents found \\nsignificant sex\\n-\\nspecific differences in weight gain after exposure to diesel exhaust in utero\\n \\n(11)\\n.\\n \\nmaternal health plays an important role in infant and child health and can\\n \\nmodify the effects of \\nenvironmental exposure. in a study of a cohort of children in the usa, maternal body mass before \\npregnancy and exposure to ambient pm\\n2.5 \\nduring pregnancy were measured. children born  to \\nmothers with a high pre\\n-\\npregnancy bmi and who \\nwere exposed to pm\\n2.5 \\nduring pregnancy and in the \\nfirst 2 years of life had a higher risk of being overweight or obese between 2 and 9 years of age. in \\naddition, children whose mothers were exposed to pm\\n2.5 \\nat levels above the median were at higher \\nrisk of\\n \\n\\n-\\npregnancy bmi\\n \\n(12)\\n.\\n \\nalthough there have been few epidemiological studies on the link between exposure to air pollution \\nand childhood obesity, seven studies were identified in a recent review in w\\nhich an association was \\nfound between aap and obesity and metabolic outcomes in children \\n(13)\\n. two prospective birth \\ncohort studies on air pollution and insulin resistance in children found positive associations between \\nexposure to traffic\\n-\\nrelated no\\n2 \\nand \\npm\\n10 \\nand insulin resistance in 10\\n-\\nyear\\n-\\nold children \\n(14). \\nan \\nincrease in proximity to the nearest major road by 500 metres increased insulin resistance by 7.2%. \\nobese or overweight children are thus at increased risk for insulin resistance and other metabo\\nlic \\ncomplications. insulin resistance is associated with risks for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular \\ndisease, which can have profound lifelong effects. in a 4\\n-\\nyear longitudinal study, jerrett et al. \\n(15) \\ninvestigated the relation between exposure to traff\\nic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution and changes in bmi in \\nchildren aged 5\\n\\n11 years in 13 communities in southern california. no\\nx \\nlevels were used as an \\nindicator of traffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution (which can contain black carbon, ultrafine particles and many \\npm compone\\nnts). exposure had a significant effect on bmi growth and bmi level at the age of 10\\n \\n61\\n \\n \\nyears. the average annual rate of bmi growth was associated with exposure to no\\nx \\nin children with \\nthe highest exposure. in another longitudinal study in \\ncalifornia \\n(16)\\n, children exposed to higher \\nlevels of no\\nx \\nfrom traffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution had significantly increased bmi growth over 8 years \\nand a higher attained bmi at 18 years of age as compared with the group with lower exposure.\\n \\nin a cohort study \\nin italy \\n(17)\\n, no association was found between exposure to no\\n2\\n, no\\nx\\n, pm\\n10\\n, pm\\n2.5\\n, \\ncoarse pm or total traffic load within 100 metres of the residence and characteristics including bmi \\nat

influence childhood obesity and metabolic \\ndysfunction. air pollution may influence metabolic development prenatally, as elevated levels of \\nleptin and adiponectin were found in\\n \\nthe umbilical cord blood of infants whose mothers  were \\nexposed to no\\n2\\n, pm\\n2.5 \\nand no during pregnancy \\n(18, 19)\\n, and these adipokines have been linked to \\nobesity\\n-\\nrelated outcomes in childhood \\n(18)\\n. in another study, increased levels of leptin and \\nadiponect\\nin were associated with increased weight gain in infant girls at 6 months of age, suggesting \\na pathway for air pollution\\n-\\nmediated risk of obesity in children\\n \\n(19)\\n.\\n \\nthe causes of metabolic dysfunction in childhood are complex. in a metabolic profiling study\\n \\nof \\noverweight or obese young people aged 8\\n\\n18 living in a highly polluted urban environment, air \\npollution was associated with higher insulin resistance and secretion and higher glycaemia \\n(20)\\n, \\nindicating air pollution is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes\\n. in another study, it was reported that \\nchildren living in mexico city, where the levels of air pollution (particularly pm\\n2.5 \\nand o\\n3\\n) are high, \\nhad altered appetite\\n-\\nregulating peptides, high blood leptin and endothelin\\n-\\n1 and vitamin d deficiency \\n(21)\\n. eve\\nn when the bmi\\n-\\nfor\\n-\\nage of the children was below the cut\\n-\\noff for obesity, the analysis \\nindicated potentially increased risks of insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes, addiction\\n-\\nlike \\nbehaviour and premature cardiovascular disease in adulthood.\\n \\nbox 9 \\nprovides information on stunting and air pollution.\\n \\n \\nbox 9. air pollution and stunting\\n \\na child who has a low height\\n-\\nfor\\n-\\nage is considered to be stunted. \\nin 2012, who adopted a global target to \\nreduce the number of stunted children under the age of 5 by 40%\\n \\nby 2025 \\n(22)\\n. \\nin 2017, 150.8 million children \\nunder the age of 5 years were stunted \\n(5)\\n. stunting has both immediate and long\\n-\\nterm effects on health and \\nwell\\n-\\nbeing, as, in addition to poor physical growth, stunted children are more susceptible to infectio\\nns and have \\nan increased risk of neurodevelopmental effects, which can affect their school and work performance \\n(23)\\n. \\nchildren who are stunted often remain shorter than their peers in adulthood and are at increased risk of \\nbecoming overweight as they grow \\nolder. stunted growth is due mainly to prolonged insufficient caloric intake \\nor other nutritional deficiencies, but a link with exposure to air pollution has also been proposed in a growing \\nbody of literature on the association between aap and stunting.\\n \\na study of maternal exposure to aap in bangladesh showed a strong link between aap and child stunting \\n(24)\\n. the study was based on outcome data from four waves of the nationally representative bangladesh \\ndemographic and health survey, conducted between 200\\n4 and 2014. maternal exposure to aap (pm\\n2.5\\n) was \\nestimated from high\\n-\\nresolution satellite data. over half of all children in the study were exposed to an annual \\nambient pm\\n2.5 \\nlevel > 46 µg/m\\n3\\n, which is over four times the who air quality guideline value of\\n \\n10 µg/m\\n3\\n. \\nthese children were significantly more likely to be stunted. it was concluded that reducing aap in bangladesh \\ncould significantly reduce child\\n \\nstunting.\\n \\nhap is also strongly linked to stunting. a population\\n-\\nbased cohort study of exposure to indo\\nor biomass fuel \\nand tobacco smoke and the risks of various adverse health outcomes in newborn infants in south india \\n(25) \\nfound that infants exposed to hap were at a 30% higher risk of being stunted at 6 months of age. the link \\nbetween hap and child stunti\\nng is further supported by the results of a systematic review and meta\\n-\\nanalysis of \\nthe\\n \\nlink\\n \\nbetween\\n \\nhap\\n \\nand\\n \\nvarious\\n \\nadverse\\n \\nhealth\\n \\noutcomes,\\n \\nincluding\\n \\nstunting\\n \\n(26)\\n.\\n \\na\\n \\nstatistically\\n \\nsignificant\\n \\n62\\n \\n \\nprotective association was found between red\\nuced exposure to hap and stunting in children under 5 years. the \\nauthors suggested that switching from polluting to clean fuels could substantially reduce the risk of child \\nstunting and other adverse health outcomes.\\n \\n \\nconclusions\\n \\nsome studies indicate a \\npotential association between exposure to aap and certain adverse metabolic \\n\\nexposure to chemical compounds during development can increase susceptibility to\\n \\ngaining weight, \\nand also the links between childhood obesity, insulin resistance and exposure to air pollution. \\nbecause of the limited number of epidemiological studies of exposure to air pollution and obesity and \\ninsulin resistance, it would be premature\\n \\nto draw conclusions about\\n \\ncausality.\\n \\n \\n \\nknowledge gaps and research needs\\n \\n \\na review of the literature suggests an association between exposure to aap and childhood \\nobesity or insulin resistance, but relatively little research has been done on the \\nassociations \\nbetween childhood overweight and obesity, insulin resistance and air\\n \\npollution.\\n\\n \\nthe effect of hap on childhood overweight and obesity has not been studied, even though \\nchildren spend a

even at exposures below united states national ambient air quality \\nstandards.\\n\\n \\nprenatal exposure to air pollution is associated with impairment of lung development and lung \\nfunction in\\n \\nchildhood.\\n\\n \\nthere is \\nevidence that lung function development improves in children in urban areas where \\nambient air quality has been\\n \\nimproved.\\n\\n \\n \\nlung function is a measure of how effectively the lungs move air in and out of the body in order to \\nexchange oxygen with the blood an\\nd remove co\\n2\\n. more simply, lung function indicates how well a \\nperson breathes. the lungs go through dramatic changes during the embryonic and fetal stages and \\ncontinue to develop after birth, until late adolescence. anything that affects the structure of \\n\\nstill\\n-\\nmaturing lungs can affect their lung function later in life. children exposed to air pollution in \\nutero or in early childhood are thus at risk of compromised lung function for the rest of their lives.\\n \\n \\n \\nambient air pollution\\n \\nmany studies h\\nave shown that exposure to air pollution has negative effects on lung function, \\nalthough the effects vary. in the european study of cohorts for air pollution effects (escape), \\ngehring et al. \\n(1) \\nfound an association between pm\\n2.5 \\nlevels at the current addr\\ness and a small \\ndecrease in lung function in children aged 6\\n\\n8 years. a prospective cohort study of children in \\ntaiwan\\n \\nshowed\\n \\nthat\\n \\nincreased\\n \\nexposure\\n \\nto\\n \\nambient\\n \\npm\\n2.5\\n \\nwas\\n \\nassociated\\n \\nwith\\n \\nlower\\n \\nrates\\n \\nof\\n \\n64\\n \\n \\ndevelopment in some measures of lung function, including forced vital capacity (fvc) and forced \\nexpiration volume in 1s (fev1) and with reduced development of fvc \\n(2)\\n. \\nreduced lung function \\nwas also seen in schoolchildren in hong kong who had long\\n-\\nterm exp\\nosure to higher levels of aap \\n(3)\\n. in four cities in china, chongqing, guangzhou, lanzhou and wuhan, exposure to ambient pm \\nwas associated with decreased development of lung function in children \\n(4)\\n.\\n \\nthe magnitude of the effects on lung function differs by\\n \\nstudy, perhaps because of spatial differences \\nin the mass, number and composition of pm. in a study of five european birth cohorts, eeftens et al.\\n \\n(5) \\nfound a more consistent association between increased pm mass and reduced lung function than \\nwith indivi\\ndual components of pm. they also found small adverse effects associated with exposure \\nto nickel and sulfur in pm. overall, these findings suggest that pm mass, rather than specific \\ncomponents, is more useful for assessing risks from exposure to air polluti\\non to lung development \\nand function in\\n \\nchildren.\\n \\ntraffic\\n-\\nrelated pollution is a subject of widespread concern. no\\n2 \\nis commonly used as a reliable \\nmarker of traffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution. in a meta\\n-\\nanalysis of 13 studies, increased levels of no\\n2 \\nwere \\nassoc\\niated with a higher prevalence of children with abnormal lung function (measured in terms of \\nfev1) \\n(6)\\n\\nbetween regional and traffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution and lung function\\n \\n(7)\\n. these authors suggested that \\nthe differences in the strength of the associations reported among studies was due to differences  in \\nthe exposure assessment methods used, which included roadway proximity, traffic count and density \\nmeasures instead of v\\nalidated\\n \\nmethods.\\n \\nsome studies reported adverse effects on lung function of pollution at levels below the national \\nambient air quality standards of the environmental protection agency in the usa. in a study of the \\neffect of relatively low exposure to pollu\\ntion on childhood lung function \\n(8)\\n, 614 mother\\n\\nchild pairs \\nin the boston area were studied. long\\n-\\nterm exposure to aap (fine particulate matter and black \\ncarbon) during pregnancy was associated with lower lung function in mid\\n-\\nchildhood.\\n \\nthere is evidence t\\nhat children with asthma are more vulnerable to the effects of air pollution. in \\nsome subgroups of asthmatic children, prenatal and early\\n-\\nlife exposure to co, pm\\n10 \\nand no\\n2 \\nhad \\nnegative\\n \\neffects\\n \\non\\n \\npulmonary\\n

pollution was linked to elevated airway oxidative stress and reduced \\nsmall airway function. in another study in north america \\n(11)\\n, exposure of children with asthma to \\nair pollution had adverse effects on bo\\nth lung function and methacholine responsiveness, which is a \\nmeasure used to evaluate the degree of bronchial response to external\\n \\nstimulation.\\n \\nprenatal exposure to air pollution can impair organogenesis and lung growth, leading to long\\n-\\nterm \\ncomplications \\n(12)\\n. newborns whose mothers were exposed to high levels of pm\\n10 \\nduring pregnancy \\nhad increased minute ventilation and higher respiratory rate and tidal breathing flow \\n(13)\\n. \\njedrychowski et al. \\n(14) \\nfound that children aged 5 years whose mothers had been e\\nxposed to high \\nlevels of pm\\n2.5 \\nduring pregnancy had reduced fvc and fev1. morales and colleagues \\n(15) \\nreported \\nlung function deficits in preschool\\n-\\nage spanish children who had been exposed to traffic\\n-\\nrelated no\\n2 \\nand benzene during the second trimester of p\\nregnancy.\\n \\nin southern california, pollution levels have been decreasing steadily over the past several decades as \\na result of air pollution control policies, and there are indications these long\\n-\\nterm reductions may \\nimprove the respiratory health of childre\\nn. a study of lung function measured annually in 2120 \\nchildren in three cohorts in three separate periods (1994\\n\\n1998, 1997\\n\\n2001 and 2007\\n\\n2011) indicated \\nan association between reduced exposure to no\\n2\\n, pm\\n2.5 \\nand pm\\n10 \\nand improved lung function \\n(measured as \\nfev1 and fvc) over 4 years \\n(16)\\n. the study also showed that the proportion of \\nchildren with low fev1 values decreased as air pollution levels fell. in a study of the same cohort \\n(17)\\n, children who moved from the study area to areas with higher air pollutio\\nn had lower lung \\nfunction growth at follow\\n-\\nup, and children who moved to areas with lower pollution had increased \\nlung function growth.\\n \\n \\n \\nhousehold air pollution\\n \\nfewer studies have been published on hap and lung function or lung function development in \\nchildren. a randomized controlled trial was performed in rural guatemala in households with \\npregnant women or infants to measure the effects of an intervention to improve indoor air quality on\\n \\n65\\n \\n \\nchildhood respiratory health \\n(18)\\n. households\\n \\nin which cooking was traditionally done over an open \\nfire were randomly selected to receive a chimney stove to improve ventilation of combustion \\nproducts from cooking, at the beginning or at the end of the 18\\n-\\nmonth trial. at the end of the trial, \\nchildren\\n \\nin houses that had received the chimney stove had significantly lower longitudinal peak \\nexpiratory flow growth and a large but non\\n-\\nsignificant decrease in fev1 growth. box 10 describes an \\nintervention in nigeria to improve the respiratory health of women \\nand children by the introduction \\nof improved\\n \\ncookstoves.\\n \\n \\nbox 10. cleaner stoves, easier breaths \\n(19)\\n \\nin nigeria, more than 70% of the population uses solid fuel stoves for cooking. most household cooking is  \\ndone by women, often in poorly ventilated \\nkitchens. this results in high exposure of both women and children \\nto hap. a community\\n-\\nbased pilot study was conducted in which low\\n-\\nemission stoves were substituted for \\ntraditional biomass stoves in three rural communities: ajibade, eruwa and olorisaoko. a\\nssessments were \\nconducted before and 1 year after the intervention in households with a mother aged \\n20\\n\\n60 \\nyears and one or \\nmore children aged 5\\n\\n17 years. before substitution of the stove, the pm\\n2.5 \\nlevels were found in several cases to \\nbe 60 times greater \\nthan the who standard, and almost half the mothers and children had diminished \\nrespiratory function. after the intervention, a remarkable decrease was found in the frequency of exposure\\n-\\n \\nrelated respiratory symptoms, such as cough, chest tightness, difficu\\nlty in breathing and rhinitis, as well as \\nheadaches, fever and\\n \\ndizziness.\\n \\n \\n \\nin cohorts of children in chongqing, guangzhou, lanzhou and wuhan, use of coal in houses without \\nappropriate ventilation was associated with deficits in lung function growth \\n(20)\\n. \\nthe fvc and fev1 \\nof exposed children were 27% and 61%, respectively, below the average annual growth levels of the \\ncohort.\\n \\nin a small study of lung function in women and children aged 7\\n\\n15 years in ecuador, who were \\nexposed to biomass fuel smoke in the hom\\ne \\n(21)\\n, exposed children had reduced fvc and fev1.\\n \\n \\n \\nbiological mechanisms\\n \\n \\ninhaled particles can be deposited in the bronchioles and the alveoli, where they may affect gas \\nexchange \\n(22)\\n. small particles, particularly pm\\n2.5\\n, are of interest because their size allows them to \\npenetrate deep into the lungs, where they cause irritation and induce oxidative stress and \\ninflammation, damaging lung cells \\n(23)\\n. pm is a mixture of physical and chemical components (e.g. \\nnitrates, sulfates, ammonium, pahs, allergens, microbial compounds, metals) that can contribute to \\nlung dysfunction \\n(22, 24)\\n.\\n \\n \\nprenatal exposure to air pollution can alter lung function and develo\\npment by various plausible \\n\\nrespiratory health \\n(25)\\n. a prospective birth cohort study of children exposed prenatally to pahs \\nindicated that lung function was better\\n \\nwhen antihistamine medication was used \\n(26)\\n, which supports \\nthe theory that the mechanism of fetal pah\\n-\\ninduced alterations in lung function is initiated by the \\nallergic inflammatory response to pollutants in the lungs.\\n \\n \\n \\nconclusion\\n \\nthere is robust evidenc\\n\\ntheir lung function growth. even at lower levels of exposure, children \\n\\n \\nwhose lungs are still \\nmaturing and therefore especially vulnerable to pollution \\n\\n \\ncan have lasting defici\\nts in their lung \\nfunction. there is also compelling evidence that policies and interventions to improve ambient or \\n\\nfunction negatively affects quality of life and \\nis

cause of child mortality worldwide. lower respiratory \\ninfections caused 878 829 deaths in children under 5 years in 2016, accounting for 15.55% of all \\nchild deaths \\n(30, 31)\\n. hap from cooking with solid fuels, aap and second\\n-\\nhand tobacco smoke were \\nthe causes of 57% of the burden of disease (in dalys) from lower respiratory infections in children \\nunder 5 years in 2012 \\n(32\\n\\n34)\\n. hap is the leading risk factor for lower \\nrespiratory infections in \\nchildren in lmics\\n, \\nand 13% of lower respiratory infections are attributable to hap and aap in

that there is substantial evidence that solid\\n-\\nfuel hap \\nincreases the risk of alri and\\n \\nthat the risk of severe and fatal alri may be more than doubled. the \\nauthors concluded, however, there is relatively limited evidence on the mechanisms by which hap \\ncauses pneumonia in children.\\n \\n \\n \\nbox 11. breathing lessons: a randomized control trial in g\\nuatemala yields insights on clean cooking and\\n \\n\\n \\nthe respire study, the first randomized controlled trial on the health effects of cooking interventions, was \\nconducted in the rural highlands of san marcos in guatemala between october 2002 \\nand december 2004. the \\n\\n-\\nterm exposure to \\nhap, particularly for women and children. the aim of the study was to determine whether reducing smoke \\nfrom a \\nplancha \\nchi\\nmney stove would reduce the risk of pneumonia in children < 18 months of age. after \\nvisiting more than 5000 households, those in which there was a pregnant woman or children under 4 months of \\nage were selected for the trial. the intervention consisted of p\\nroviding some households with a closed chimney \\nplancha\\n. levels of co in the home were monitored, and the children were followed for 18 months at periodic \\nvisits by field workers and underwent medical examinations, which included monitoring of hypoxaemia an\\nd \\nchest x\\n-\\nrays if pneumonia was diagnosed. the researchers found a 33% reduction in diagnosed cases of severe \\npneumonia in children living in households with the improved stoves, suggesting that exposure to pollution \\nfrom household fuel combustion plays a \\nrole in the pathogenesis of pneumonia and that substitution of clean \\nfuels and devices for cooking and heating may reduce the incidence of pneumonia in children\\n \\n(50)\\n.\\n \\nseveral studies in the same cohort were performed in parallel. one found that exposure in\\n \\nutero to smoke from \\nopen wood stoves increased the risk of adverse neurodevelopment outcomes over that of children in households \\nwith a stove that had an enclosed combustion chamber, such as a \\nplancha (51)\\n. another found a lower \\nincidence of children born\\n \\nwith low birth weight to mothers living in households with a \\nplancha\\n \\n(52)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nbiological mechanisms\\n \\npollutants contribute to respiratory infections by several mechanisms. inhaled pm can damage the \\nnormal defence mechanisms of the respiratory tract by causi\\nng inflammation and  oxidative stress, \\nand breathing no\\n2\\n, which is a free radical, can also damage and inflame the respiratory tract. there is \\nsome evidence that combustion\\n-\\nderived pm interferes with alveolar macrophages, which have an \\nessential role in th\\ne response of the immune system to viruses and bacterial infections, therefore \\nincreasing the susceptibility of individuals to infections. laboratory analysis of human macrophages \\nexposed\\n \\nto\\n \\nhap\\n \\nshowed\\n \\nimpaired\\n \\nability\\n \\nto\\n \\nphagocytose\\n \\nstreptococcus\\n \\npneumoniae\\n \\nand\\n \\n68\\n \\n \\nmycobacterium tuberculosis \\nand a lower oxidative burst

carbon alters the biofilm structure, composition  \\nand function of \\nstaphylococcus aureus \\nand \\nstreptococcus pneumoniae \\nand their tolerance to \\nproteolytic degradation and response to antibiotics \\n(54)\\n. furthermore, black carbon caused \\ns. \\npneumoniae \\nt\\no spread from the nasopharynx to the lungs in an animal model. these results have \\nimportant implications for the pathways by which air pollution may cause lung infections in\\n \\nchildren.\\n \\n \\n \\nbox 12. air pollution and tuberculosis\\n \\ntb is an infectious disease ca\\nused by \\nmycobacterium tuberculosis\\n. it affects mainly the lungs but can also \\nspread to other body systems. it is transmitted \\nfrom person to person through the air\\n. disease progression may \\nbe influenced by environmental factors, and air pollution has been i\\ndentified as a potential risk factor for active \\ntb in adults in several studies. there is a growing scientific evidence that both aap and hap are associated \\nwith tb in children, but no systematic reviews specifically on studies in children have been publis\\nhed, and the \\nrisk of childhood tb associated with exposure to aap has not yet been evaluated. an ecological study \\nconducted in north carolina, usa, showed a significant association between pulmonary tb and long\\n-\\nterm \\nexposure to pm. children and adolescents\\n \\naged 0\\n\\n24 years were included in the study, but their risk was not \\nindependently assessed \\n(55)\\n. another study in adults in california, usa, also found a relation between \\nresidential exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nand the presence of smear\\n-\\npositive acid\\n-\\nfast bacilli \\n(5\\n6)\\n.\\n \\nthe association between exposure to hap from solid fuel combustion and tb has been evaluated in a few \\nstudies. exposure to biomass fuel combustion exhaust was found to prevent macrophages in the lung from \\nfunctioning correctly \\n(57)\\n. as macrophages have\\n \\na key role in the immune response to infection, these changes \\nmay increase the vulnerability of individuals to tb and other respiratory infections \\n(58)\\n. a meta\\n-\\nanalysis of \\nstudies in children and adults performed in 2014 \\n(59) \\nshowed a relation between hap\\n \\nfrom solid fuel \\ncombustion and the risk of tb. two of the studies included in the review were specifically of children, and \\nboth found positive but nonsignificant associations. a case\\n\\ncontrol study in india showed a correlation between \\nexposure to hap fro\\nm solid fuel combustion and the risk of contracting tb in children < 5 years \\n(60)\\n. the \\nevidence suggests a positive association between exposure to air pollution and tb infection in children, \\nalthough further research is\\n \\nneeded.\\n \\n \\n \\nconclusions\\n \\nmany studies \\noffer consistent, compelling evidence that exposure to aap or hap is a major risk \\nfactor for alri in children. it is clear that exposure to air pollution increases the incidence of alri, \\nincluding pneumonia. while a range of pollutants has been found to ex\\nacerbate respiratory infections, \\nthere is growing evidence that pm has an especially strong effect.\\n \\n \\nknowledge gaps and research needs\\n \\n\\n \\nthere is a lack of studies on associations between exposure to specific chemical components of \\nambient particulate matter\\n \\nand alri such as pneumonia in young\\n \\nchildren.\\n \\n\\n \\nresearch on the mechanisms through which air pollution induces lung infection will aid in \\nidentification of

both aap and hap have long been suspected of contributing to childhood asthma,  \\nand a growing body of research \\nsuggests that exposure to air pollution both causes and exacerbates \\nthe condition. as children have narrower airways and higher breathing rates than adults, they are \\nparticularly vulnerable to airborne pollution. furthermore, children tend to spend much ti\\nme doing \\nphysical activity outdoors and breathe through their mouths more frequently than adults, allowing \\nmore unfiltered air pollutants to affect their still\\n-\\ndeveloping\\n \\nlungs.\\n \\n

decades as a result of air pollution controls, show that decreases in aap levels were \\nassociated with statistically significant decreases in bronchitic symptoms among children with  \\nasthma

between exposure\\n \\nto\\n \\naap and the occurrence of otitis media in\\n \\nchildren.\\n\\n \\nhap from combustion may increase the risk of otitis\\n \\nmedia.\\n\\notitis media, inflammation of the middle ear, is a common childhood infection \\n(1)\\n. viral and \\nbacterial ear infections are the primary causes of \\notitis media, which often occurs with upper \\nrespiratory tract infections \\n(2)\\n. environmental exposures also play a role. exposure to second\\n-\\nhand \\ntobacco smoke is a known risk factor \\n(3, 4)\\n, and evidence suggests that exposure to aap and \\nhap \\nmay have a simil\\nar effect on the development of otitis media. a child with recurrent otitis media can \\nhave long\\n-\\nterm consequences, such as hearing loss, and potential difficulties in learning and \\ncommunication \\n(5,\\n \\n6)\\n.\\n \\n \\nambient air\\n \\npollution\\n \\naap has been strongly linked to otitis media in children. a review \\n(2) \\nof five cross\\n-\\nsectional, two \\ntime\\n-\\nseries and three cohort studies found a higher prevalence of otitis media in children living in \\nareas with high levels of aap \\n(7\\n\\n10)\\n. traffic\\n-\\nrelated a\\nir pollution was associated with risk for otitis \\nmedia \\n(2) \\nand with higher risks for ear, nose and throat infections \\n(11)\\n. in a study of over 7000 \\nchildren in germany \\n(12)\\n, the prevalence of otitis media decreased over a 7\\n-\\nyear period in areas in\\n \\n76\\n \\n \\n4\\n \\nwhich air quality improved. strong conclusions could not be drawn from the review because of the \\nlimited number of studies.\\n \\na systematic review of 24 studies \\n(1) \\nfound limited but increasing evidence of a link between \\nexposure to aap and\\n \\notitis media in children. all the studies found evidence of a positive association \\nwith aap, but the results were inconsistent for most pollutants, except no\\n2\\n.\\n \\nother studies have reported a higher incidence of otitis media among children exposed to air \\np\\nollutants, especially no\\n2 \\nand pm\\n2.5\\n. brauer et al. \\n(13) \\nobserved an association between exposure to \\ntraffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollutants (no\\n2\\n, pm\\n2.5 \\nand elemental carbon) and the incidence of otitis media in \\nthe first 2 years of life in two large birth cohorts i\\nn germany and the netherlands. zemak and \\ncolleagues \\n(3) \\nanalysed emergency department visits by children aged 1\\n\\n3 years for otitis media over \\n10 years in canada and found an association with exposure to co and no\\n2\\n. in another study in \\ncanada \\n(14)\\n, 42,413 c\\nhildren born in british columbia were followed until 2 years of age. the \\nauthors found that the average levels of exposure to pollutants (no, co, pm\\n2.5 \\nand wood smoke) in \\ntheir residence 2 months before hospital visits were associated with the occurrence o\\nf otitis media. in \\na study in spain, aguilera et al. \\n(15) \\nreported a significant association between otitis media in early \\nchildhood and exposure to no\\n2 \\nand benzene during pregnancy. a meta\\n-\\nanalysis of 10 european birth \\ncohort studies of the effects of tra\\nffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution (no\\n2\\n, no\\nx\\n, pm\\n2.5\\n, pm\\n10 \\nand pm\\n2.5\\n-\\n10\\n) on \\notitis media \\n(16) \\nshowed an association with the annual average ambient no\\n2 \\nconcentration during \\nthe first year of\\n \\nlife.\\n \\ntime\\n-\\nseries and case\\n-\\ncrossover studies have also reported posit\\nive associations between exposure to \\naap and visits to an emergency department for otitis media. in an analysis of 4815 such visits by \\nchildren aged < 3 years in ontario, canada \\n(17)\\n, the number of visits increased in the days after an \\nincrease in the ambi\\nent levels of o\\n3 \\nand pm. a study of 422 268 emergency department visits for \\notitis media between 2002 and 2008 in georgia, usa, found associations with exposure to co, no\\n2\\n, \\no\\n3\\n, pm\\n10\\n, pm\\n2.5\\n, element carbon, organic carbon ammonium and so \\n2\\n-\\n \\n(18)\\n.\\n \\nthe \\nevidence indicates a consistent association between exposure to air pollution and otitis media.\\n \\n \\nhousehold air pollution\\n \\nan association between parental tobacco smoking and otitis media in young children has been well \\ndocumented \\n(4, 19\\n\\n21)\\n; however, few st\\nudies have been conducted on the associations with other \\nsources of hap, particularly in low\\n-\\nincome countries \\n(20)\\n.\\n \\na systematic review of risk factors for chronic and recurrent otitis media \\n(20) \\nidentified only one \\nstudy on hap \\n(22)\\n, in which indoor cooking was associated with chronic suppurative otitis media. \\nolder studies in high\\n-\\nincome countries gave inconsistent results. in a case\\n\\ncontrol study of 125 otitis \\nmedia patients and 237 controls in a private paediatric practice in new \\nyork, usa, between october \\n1986 and may 1987, exposure to a wood\\n-\\nburning stove was associated with otitis media \\n(23)\\n. a  \\nstudy of more than 900 infants in two states in the usa \\n(24) \\nfound no significant association between \\notitis media and secondary heatin\\ng sources (fireplace, wood stove, kerosene heater and air \\nconditioning).\\n \\namong the few studies from lmics is a case\\n\\ncontrol study in maputo, mozambique \\n(25)\\n, which \\nshowed an association between use of wood and charcoal as household fuels and the occurrence\\n \\nof \\notitis media. a study of 189 children living in urban areas in two nigerian states \\n(26) \\nindicated that \\nindoor cooking was significantly associated with the occurrence of chronic suppurative otitis media; \\nhowever, the type of fuel used was not specified\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nmultiple sources of exposure\\n \\nit is important to consider the timing of exposure to household and ambient air pollutants. deng et al.\\n \\n(26)\\n \\nconducted a retrospective cohort study of 1617 children aged 3\\n\\n4 years in changsha, china. the \\nlifetime prevalence of o\\ntitis media in preschool children was associated with prenatal exposure to an\\n \\nindustrial air pollutant (so\\n2\\n) and postnatal exposure to indoor renovations. both aap from industrial\\n \\nactivities and hap from renovations were associated with development of earl\\ny childhood ear \\ninfection.\\n \\n77\\n \\n \\nbiological mechanisms\\n \\nthe biological pathways through which air pollution contributes to otitis media in children are not \\nclear. epithelial cells of the middle ear had significantly altered gene expression in re\\nsponse to \\nexposure to pm \\n(27)\\n, and the authors noted that some of the genes affected are involved in cellular \\nprocesses, including generation of reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell \\ndifferentiation and inflammatory response. these m\\nay therefore be triggered by exposure to pm.\\n \\nin another study, increased mucin gene expression (which can contribute to chronic infection), \\ndecreased cell viability and an increased inflammatory response were observed as a result of  \\nexposure to diesel ex\\nhaust particles \\n(28)\\n. these findings were supported by the results of a study in \\nexperimental animals. further research will help to confirm whether these processes play a role in the \\ndevelopment of otitis media in\\n \\nchildren.\\n \\n \\n \\nconclusions\\n \\nthere is \\nconsistent evidence of an association between exposure to aap and otitis media in children. \\nthe findings on the effects of individual pollutants are not consistent, and few studies of hap are \\navailable.\\n \\n \\n \\nknowledge gaps and research needs\\n \\n\\n \\nprospective obser\\nvational epidemiological studies on the association between aap exposure\\n \\nand \\notitis media occurrence should be\\n \\nundertaken.\\n \\n\\n \\nevidence from studies of \\nhap \\nis limited. as infants and children spend much of their time in the \\nhome, more studies should be \\nconducted, with detailed

\\nchildhood\\n \\nleukaemia.\\n\\n \\nseveral studies have found associations between prenatal exposure to aap and higher risks \\nof \\nretinoblastoma and leukaemia in\\n \\nchildren.\\n\\n \\nrelatively few studies have been conducted on hap and cancer risk in children. nevertheless, \\nhap is strongly associated w\\nith several types of cancer in adults and commonly contains a \\nvariety of classified\\n \\ncarcinogens.\\n\\nthe incidence of cancer in children is increasing, as shown by data from 68 countries and over 100 \\npopulation\\n-\\nbased registries published by the international a\\ngency for research on cancer (iarc) \\n(1)\\n. in the period 1990\\n\\n2017, an average of 215 000 cases of cancers per year were diagnosed in \\nchildren under 15 years of age, and 85 000 new cases were diagnosed among those aged 15\\n\\n19 years \\n(1)\\n. in view of the lack of\\n \\ncancer registries in several low\\n-\\nincome countries, however, these statistics \\nmay be underestimates of the actual incidence \\n(2)\\n.\\n \\nthe most prevalent types of cancer are different in children and adults \\n(3)\\n. leukaemia and lymphoma \\nare the most common in chil\\ndren, accounting for almost half of all childhood cancers, followed by \\ncentral nervous system tumours and tumours originating in embryonic tissues, such as\\n \\n79\\n \\n \\nneuroblastoma, retinoblastoma and nephroblastoma. children also develop carcinomas\\n, but the \\nincidence is low \\n(2)\\n.\\n \\n \\nambient air pollution\\n \\nchildren are exposed to a wide range of cancer\\n-\\ncausing pollutants in ambient air. diesel exhaust, \\naap and particulate matter have been classified by working groups convened by iarc as group 1 \\ncarcinogens. nitroarenes, which are derived from diesel engine emissions, have been classified \\nas  \\ngroup 2 carcinogens, and gasoline exhaust has been classified as a group 2b carcinogen (possibly \\ncarcinogenic to humans) \\n(4)\\n. traffic exhaust also contains h\\narmful contaminants, such as co, pahs, \\nbenzene, no\\nx \\nand pm \\n(5)\\n. benzene has been classified in group 1 (carcinogenic to humans) \\n(5,\\n \\n6)\\n.\\n \\nleukaemia is the most frequent childhood cancer \\n(2)\\n. although the etiology of at least 90% of cases \\nof leukaemia remain\\ns unknown in \\n(7)\\n, many studies have shown that exposure to traffic\\n-\\nrelated \\npollution (including diesel and gasoline exhaust) is associated with childhood leukaemia \\n(4, 8, 9)\\n. a \\nmeta\\n-\\nanalysis indicated that the development of leukaemia in early childhood is\\n \\nassociated with \\nexposure to traffic during the postnatal period, with a risk increased by 1.5 times \\n(9)\\n. in addition, \\nexposure to pm\\n10 \\nwas independently associated with the risk for leukaemia. in a meta\\n-\\nanalysis on the \\nrole of benzene in the pathogenesis \\nof childhood leukaemia, traffic\\n-\\nrelated exposure to benzene \\nincreased the risk for acute myeloid leukaemia by a factor of 2.07 and the risk for acute \\nlymphoblastic leukaemia by 1.49\\n \\n(10)\\n.\\n \\nthe relation between proximity to highways, urban aap and childhood \\ncancer has also been \\nassessed. a study in a nationwide cohort in switzerland found that the risk for leukaemia of children \\nwho lived < 100 m from a highway was 1.43 times greater than that of children who lived > 500 m \\naway, especially for those < 5 years \\nof age \\n(11)\\n. box 14 illustrates differences in childhood cancer \\nrisk according to\\n \\nresidence.\\n \\n \\nbox 14. location matters: variations in air pollution and childhood cancer risk in a city in turkey\\n \\na study in turkey was conducted to assess the relation between exposure to benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, \\nxylenes, no\\n2 \\nand o\\n3 \\nand childhood cancer risk in two areas of the city of eskisehir \\n(12)\\n. students at two \\nschools participated: one in an urban area known to have high levels of air pollutants and one in a suburban \\nlocation with lower levels of pollution. benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes are volatile organic \\ncompounds considered to be hazardous air \\npollutants; benzene is a group 1 human carcinogen\\n \\n(5)\\n.\\n \\npersonal air sampling and indoor (school and home) and outdoor air sampling was conducted over a \\n24\\n-\\nh \\nperiod. children who lived in smoking and in non\\n-\\nsmoking homes were identified. an activity diary w\\nas given \\nto each child, with a questionnaire on socioeconomic status, family activities and house characteristics (e.g. \\nfloor type, renovations). potential sources of pollutants at residences and schools were identified from a \\nchecklist. personal, exposure\\n \\nto indoor and outdoor concentrations of all air pollutants except o\\n3 \\nwas higher for \\nchildren in the urban school than at the suburban site. personal concentrations were also strongly correlated \\nwith indoor concentrations (except for o\\n3\\n). the responses to \\nthe questionnaire indicated that interactions with \\ntobacco smoke, solvent\\n-\\nbased products and proximity to petrol stations increased exposure to pollutants. the \\nauthors found a higher risk of cancer in the urban school group, particularly for children whose\\n \\nparents smoked, \\nthan in children in the suburban\\n \\nlocation.\\n \\nthe risk assessment in this study focused on chronic exposure to pollutants rather than acute toxic effects. the \\nfindings show that levels of pollution can differ significantly in different parts \\nof a city, as can the health effects \\nof ambient and indoor exposure on children in different areas.\\n \\n \\n \\na number of studies on prenatal exposure to air pollutants indicate associations with cancer. a study \\nin california, usa, of more than 3000 children with \\nvarious types of cancer \\n(13) \\nfound a clear \\nrelation between exposure to traffic pollution during gestation and the first year of life and the risk of \\ncancer by the age of 6 years, not only for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia but also for germ\\n-\\ncell \\ntumours an\\nd retinoblastoma. a study in texas, usa, indicated an increased risk of embryonal \\ntumours in children whose mothers lived < 500 m from a major roadway during pregnancy \\n(14)\\n. the \\nstrongest association was found with retinoblastoma, the risk for which was in\\ncreased 2.57 times. in a \\nstudy of more than two million children followed\\n-\\nup from birth to 4 years of age in canada \\n(15)\\n, \\nprenatal exposure to aap, particularly during the first trimester of pregnancy, was associated with \\nincreased risks of astrocytoma and\\n \\nacute lymphatic leukaemia. in another study in california, usa\\n \\n80\\n \\n \\n(16)\\n, each 25 parts per billion increase in average maternal exposure to no\\nx \\nduring pregnancy \\nincreased the risk for leukaemia in their offspring by 23%. bilateral retinoblas\\ntoma was associated \\nwith exposure to no\\nx \\nduring the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. exposure to pahs during \\npregnancy was associated with a 1.44\\n-\\ntimes increase in risk of medulloblastoma in early childhood \\n(17)\\n.\\n \\n \\nthe exposures of both parents mu\\nst be taken into account in assessing the risk of childhood cancer, in \\naddition to exposure in utero \\n(4)\\n. in a case\\n\\ncontrol study in australia \\n(18)\\n, both maternal exposure \\nduring pregnancy and paternal pre\\n-\\nbirth occupational exposure to diesel and petrol e\\nxhaust were \\nassociated with an increased risk of acute childhood lymphoblastic leukaemia. a study in the united \\nkingdom found a small but statistically significant increased risk of leukaemia in children whose \\nfathers were occupationally exposed to vehicle\\n \\nexhaust fumes and particulate hydrocarbons around \\nthe time of conception \\n(19)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nhousehold air pollution\\n \\nemissions from household combustion of coal have been classified by iarc as a group 1 carcinogen \\n(20)\\n, emissions from household combustion of biomass \\nfuel, in particular wood, are probably \\ncarcinogenic, and the combustion of wood and other biomass fuels can produce toxicants including \\nco, pahs, aldehydes and free radicals that are classified as group 2a carcinogens (probably \\ncarcinogenic to humans). met\\nal compounds present in solid fuel emissions, such as arsenic and \\nnickel, have also been classified as group 1 carcinogens \\n(21)\\n. in some rural areas of china, up to the \\n60% of the population under 30 years of age are exposed to arsenic from household coal \\ncombustion, \\nwhich may account for the higher incidence of cancer in these populations\\n \\n(22)\\n.\\n \\nhap has been strongly associated with several types of cancer in adults, including lung cancer, upper \\naerodigestive tract cancer, kidney and cervical cancer \\n(20, 23\\n\\n27)\\n, but few studies have been \\nconducted on hap and cancer risk in children. a study in australia \\n(28) \\nfound increased risks of \\nchildhood leukaemia by 1.41 times in association with use of a wood burner to heat the home during \\npregnancy and by 1.25 times \\nwhen used after birth. a case\\n\\ncontrol study in california, usa, \\nprovided evidence of an association between lung cancer and exposure to coal\\n-\\nburning during \\nchildhood and adolescence \\n(29)\\n. given the susceptibility of children, the known cancer risks of adul\\nts \\nand the longer time available for cancer to develop in children, further research should be conducted \\non the risk of cancer associated with exposure to hap during\\n \\nchildhood.\\n \\n \\n \\nbiological mechanisms\\n \\nthe pathogenesis of childhood cancer is complex, as it \\ninvolves many genetic and environmental \\nfactors. in most cases, the primary causes remain unknown, although most of the scientific literature \\nsuggests that the immune system plays a role. a prominent hypothesis is that faulty functioning of  \\nthe immune sys\\ntem in response to infections and allergies is the primary cause \\n(8)\\n, and this is \\nsupported by some studies that suggest that environmental exposure to certain chemicals and \\npollutants that are known to alter the immune system can lead to this aberrant res\\nponse  and, \\ntherefore, to the outcome of leukaemia\\n \\n(30)\\n.\\n \\nit has also been proposed that air pollutants contribute to carcinogenesis by damaging dna. \\nparticulate matter contains several genotoxic and mutagenic chemicals that cause single\\n-\\nstrand \\nbreaks, micr\\nonuclei, sister chromatid exchange and oxidative dna damage mediated by reactive \\noxygen species \\n(31)\\n. dna adducts and micronuclei have been identified in the cord blood of women \\nexposed to air pollution during pregnancy; these are important biomarkers of d\\nna damage that can \\nresult in mutations leading to cancer \\n(32)\\n. furthermore, several studies have found that certain genes \\nin xenobiotics pathways (e.g. \\ncyp2e1\\n, \\ngstm1\\n, \\nnqo1\\n, \\nnat2 \\nand \\nmdr1\\n) increase the risk of \\nleukaemia by themselves or in association with \\nexposure to chemicals\\n \\n(33)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nconclusion\\n \\nthe rising rate of cancer in children worldwide is deeply concerning. there is ample evidence that \\nboth prenatal and childhood exposure to aap is associated with increased risk of leukaemia and\\n \\n81\\n \\n \\noth\\ner cancers. there is robust evidence of an increased risk for cancer in adults exposed to hap, but \\nfew studies have examined the association between hap and childhood cancers.\\n \\n \\nknowledge gaps and research needs\\n \\n \\nfew studies have been conducted on the \\nassociation between exposure to hap from polluting \\nfuels and childhood\\n \\ncancers.\\n\\n \\n \\nreferences \\n\\n \\ncancer\\n \\n1.\\n \\nsteliarova\\n-\\nfoucher ecm, ries lag, hesseling p, moreno f, shin hy, stiller ca. lyon: international

lung development, reduce lung function and \\nraise the risk of chronic lung disease in\\n \\nadulthood.\\n\\n \\nevidence suggests that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy can predispose the offspring \\nto cardiovascu\\nlar disease later in\\n \\nlife.\\n\\n \\nthe life course of children can be significantly affected by exposure to toxic air pollutants. children \\nwho are exposed to air pollution during the prenatal period and early life are more likely to \\nexperience adverse health outc\\nomes as they mature and throughout adulthood. exposure not only has \\n\\nevident only in later life. air pollution can contribute to effects on all of the orga\\nns and systems of  \\n\\ndelayed emergence of certain adverse effects are an area of growing scientific interest. several recent \\nstudies have addressed these factors \\nand associated\\n \\ndiseases.\\n \\nimpairment of lung growth and development in childhood is an important risk factor for chronic lung \\ndisease in

\\nestimates were almost as large as those for personal smoking. in a study of a swedish cohort, 2278 \\nchildren were followed up \\n(2)\\n. it was found that exposure to traffic\\n-\\nrelated air pollution in in\\nfancy is \\nassociated with a lower fev1 at the age of 16 years. factors in early life predicted decreased lung \\nfunction decades later, suggesting that some mechanisms related to lung ageing may be established in \\nchildhood or in utero.\\n \\none of the common outco\\nmes of impaired lung function is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, \\nand the link between \\nhap \\nand development of this disease has been addressed. a meta\\n-\\nanalysis \\nfound that people with long\\n-\\nterm exposure to hap from solid fuel combustion had twice the r\\nisk of \\nchronic\\n

\\nexposure to high levels of air pollutants during pregnancy can predispose to cardiovascular diseases \\nlater in life. exposure to pollution as the fetal organs develop during pregnancy can trigger \\nsusceptibility to weight gain and \\nneuroinflammation in adulthood \\n(5, 6)\\n. early exposure to air \\npollutants has also been associated with early cardiovascular phenotypes in young adults. zhang et al.\\n \\n(7) \\nreported an association between higher exposure to pm\\n2.5 \\nduring the third trimester of \\npregnancy\\n \\nand high blood pressure in children at 3\\n\\n9 years of age. breton et al. \\n(8) \\nfound an  association\\n \\nbetween prenatal exposure to ambient pollutants (pm\\n10\\n, pm\\n2.5\\n) and higher carotid arterial stiffness, a\\n \\nbiomarker of endothelial function, in a popula\\ntion of university students. iannuzzi et al. \\n(9) \\nevaluated \\n52 italian children and found that those who lived closer to a main road had higher carotid arterial \\nstiffness than those living further away. thiering et al. \\n(10) \\nconcluded that traffic\\n-\\nrelated ai\\nr pollution \\nmay increase the risk of insulin resistance. in all these studies, confounding variables such \\nas \\neconomic status, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, onset of puberty and height and weight \\nwere accounted\\n \\nfor.\\n \\nhonda et al. \\n(11) \\nreported a \\nprobable relation between early exposure to air pollutants and \\ndevelopment of anaemia later in life. this disorder is highly prevalent in elderly populations and is \\nassociated with numerous

disease, cardiovascular disease and other adverse health outcomes in \\nadulthood. early exposure can sow the seeds of serious long\\n-\\nterm illness, in additio\\nn to heightening \\nthe risks of

at risk \\nof both short\\n-\\n \\nand long\\n-\\nterm \\nhealth outcomes. as summarized above, numerous studies have linked \\nair pollution to adverse birth outcomes, infant mortality, neurodevelopmental disorders, childhood \\nobesity, compromised lung function, pneumonia, asthma and otitis media, with associations \\nof \\nvarying strength. in light of this evidence, major health professional organizations throughout the \\nworld are focusing increasingly on the adverse health impacts of air pollution on children. while \\nfurther research is needed in a number of areas, the sc\\nientific evidence is already sufficient for taking \\nclear, concrete steps now to reduce the exposure of pregnant women and children to air\\n \\npollution.\\n \\nhealth professionals are trusted sources of information and guidance. paediatricians, family doctors, \\ngyna\\necologists, obstetricians, midwives, nurses and community health care workers who interact with \\nchildren can all play significant roles in advocating for policies to reduce childhood exposure to air \\npollution. health care professionals commonly treat the e\\nffects of exposure\\n-\\nrelated illness but rarely \\nreceive training in identifying and managing the underlying causes and are rarely involved in policy\\n-\\n \\nmaking. health professionals should expand their role in the management of childhood exposure to \\nair polluti\\non, with better methods of care and prevention and collective\\n \\naction.\\n \\nthe broader health sector must develop a comprehensive approach to this problem. preventing the \\nhealth impacts of air pollution on children requires action by both decision\\n-\\nmakers and in\\ndividual \\nhealth care professionals, who are best positioned to educate

be achieved with a coordinated, effective policy. southern california \\nused to be one of the most polluted regions in the usa. a persistent \\nbrown haze was a fact of life for residents \\nof los angeles in the 1960s. over the past few decades, however, california has cleaned up its outdoor air \\ndramatically. the state treated its aap problem as a public health crisis that demanded strong action. it\\n \\nintroduced strict emission controls on almost every source of aap, with low\\n-\\nemission vehicle programmes, \\nemissions standards for heavy\\n-\\nduty vehicles and diesel vehicles, requirements for emissions reduction by power \\nplants and refineries and programmes to\\n \\nimprove the energy efficiency of and reduce emissions from consumer \\nproducts and appliances. through the clean air act and its amendments, the federal government also imposed \\nmore stringent air pollution standards and effective, concurrent policies to red\\nuce emissions from vehicles and \\nenergy\\n-\\n\\nlegislation and had huge benefits for californians, as the concentrations of several air pollutants were reduced \\nb\\ny 15\\n\\n65% \\n(24)\\n. children in california now breathe more easily, as the reduction in pollutant levels has \\nresulted in significant improvements in the lung function \\n(25)\\n. california lawmakers took action partly in \\nresponse to strong evidence of the effects of\\n \\nair pollution on health, highlighting the important role of health \\nprofessionals in fostering\\n \\nchange.\\n \\n \\n \\nbox 25. smart subsidies: success in transitioning millions of households to clean fuels\\n \\n\\nassociation and the united nations, is to convince \\nhouseholds to change from polluting fuels for cooking primarily to lpg, a fuel that is much cleaner for health. \\nsuch a change requires access to affordable fuels and technologies and the financial means to\\n \\nobtain them, and \\nthese factors can be influenced by public policy \\n(26)\\n.\\n \\n\\nhouseholds in indonesia were using kerosene, a polluting fuel that is also a maj\\nor risk of poisoning in children, \\nas their main energy source. the government subsidized the purchase of kerosene, at major expense to the \\nstate coffers. in 2007, the government launched a national programme to switch more than 50 million people \\nfrom keros\\nene to lpg. after an extended assessment involving authorities at all levels, conversion packages \\nwere distributed, accompanied by communication and education campaigns to increase awareness. within the \\nfirst 6 years, lpg packages had been distributed to 5\\n4 million households. a large proportion of households \\nhave since switched to this cleaner energy source, reducing the cost to the government of petroleum\\n-\\nrelated \\nsubsidies by more than us$ 6 billion. the programme resulted in a reduction in co\\n2 \\nemissions \\nby 8.4 million \\ntonnes per year and also reduced emissions of other air pollutants, such as pm, methane, co and hydrocarbons. \\na survey after implementation of the policy showed that 99.8% of households preferred using lpg to kerosene, \\nciting greater efficie\\nncy, speed of cooking and cleanliness\\n \\n(27)\\n.\\n \\n\\nintervention, half of the decrease being seen among infants in the early neonatal period. this caref\\nully \\ncoordinated nationwide intervention is a compelling example for other countries that wish to accelerate the \\ntransition from household use of polluting fuels to benefit the health of their children \\n(27\\n\\n29)\\n.\\n \\nfurther evidence of the importance of targete\\nd subsidies in promoting a transition to clean fuels was found in \\nlatin america and the caribbean. use of lpg varies widely across the region, and over 80 million people still \\nrely on polluting fuels as their primary source of household energy. achieving s\\n\\n\\nas it would avert an estimated 82 361 premature deaths and 2 327 146 dalys annually \\n(30)\\n. in latin america \\nand the cari\\n\\nfuels. subsidies for lpg consumption helped bolivia to lower the proportion of the population that used \\npolluting cooking fuels from 36% in 2005 to 23% i\\nn 2013. other countries, such as brazil, used cash transfer \\nprogrammes, which accelerated the transition, from 16% to < 5% in a decade. it has been estimated that \\nsubsidies for natural and lpg gas allowed 39% of the rural population and almost the entire u\\nrban population \\nto switch from polluting fuels to lpg. targeted subsidies should therefore be considered a policy option for \\nachieving the sdg7 on clean\\n \\nenergy.\\n \\neffective programmes to promote adoption of clean fuels can result in meaningful health gains f\\nor children. \\nhealth professionals can play a role, by justifying the health benefits of such interventions to policy\\n-\\n \\nand \\ndecision\\n-\\nmakers, drawing on these success stories.\\n \\n \\nbox 26. moving to cleaner fuels in india

\\nprotect the most vulnerable\\n \\nwhile providing information to families and communities is important, it may not remove other \\nbarriers to access. the poorest communities often face the greatest environmental risks to their  \\nhealth, and their children are especially vulnerable. poverty often underlies these disproportionate \\nrisks, as those living in poor communities may be unable \\nto afford cleaner household fuels, access \\ncare or move to an area with cleaner air. they may also be members of marginalized groups that face \\nsystemic barriers to reducing exposure to air pollution. polluting industries, waste disposal sites, bus \\ndepots an\\nd trucking routes are often situated in low\\n-\\nincome communities, where residents lack the \\npolitical power to limit or remove these harmful sources of\\n \\nexposure.\\n \\nin households that rely on polluting fuels for cooking and heating, women and their children ofte\\nn \\ntravel long distances to collect fuel and spend much time gathering, processing and cooking with \\nthese fuels. removing or reducing the primary sources of pollution is often the best way to protect \\nchildren from the damage it can cause. therefore, low\\n-\\ncos\\nt solutions and approaches are likely to \\nresult in the most progress in affected\\n \\ncommunities.\\n \\nlow\\n-\\nincome families are often constrained in their options to improve air quality in their own homes. \\nbecause of market and other forces beyond their control, cle\\nan fuels and technologies may not be \\naffordable, available or accessible. beyond the household, individuals and families have even less \\ncontrol over the air they breathe. to reduce and prevent exposure to both hap and aap, public \\npolicy is essential. evide\\nnce\\n-\\nbased air quality standards, monitoring pollutant levels over time and \\nproper enforcement mechanisms can reduce exposure and save lives.\\n \\nair pollutants have no political borders; they travel where the wind and prevailing weather patterns \\ntake them. the\\n\\nexposure. like the pollutants, actions to protect children should transcend sectoral, geographical and \\npolitical boundaries. what is needed are approaches to preventing \\nexposure that are complementary \\nand mutually reinforcing, at every scale: in the home, the clinic, the health care institution, the \\nmunicipality, the national government and the global community. collectively, health care \\nprofessionals can push for strong \\naction from decision\\n-\\nmakers to protect their most vulnerable and \\nvoiceless citizens: children who have little or no control over the quality of the air that surrounds \\n\\nm onto a path \\nwith suffering, illness and challenge. in some cases, the damage is irreversible \\n\\n \\nbut it is also \\npreventable. the sources of risk and the health effects are diverse and complex, but the solution is \\n\\nby working together, we can protect millions of \\nvulnerable

our lives. the newborn depends on vision \\nto recognize and bond with its mother; the toddler, to master balance \\nand learn to walk; the schoolboy, to walk to school, read and learn; the \\nyoung woman to participate in the workforce; and the older woman, to \\nmaintain her independence.  \\nyet, as this report shows, eye conditions and vision impairment are \\nwidespread, and far too often they still go untreated. globally, \\nat least \\n2.2 billion people have a vision impairment, and of these, at least 1 \\nbillion people have a vision impairment that could have been prevented \\nor is yet to be addressed. \\nas usual, this burden is not borne equally. it weighs more heavily on \\nlow- and middle-income countries, on older people, and on rural \\ncommunities. most worrying is that projections show that global \\ndemand for eye care is set to surge in the coming years due to \\npopulation growth, ageing, and changes in lifestyle.\\nclearly, we have no choice but to take on this challenge. it is time to \\nmake sure that as many people as possible in all countries can see as \\nwell as current health technologies and health systems allow. \\nbut it is important to recognize and build on the many successes in eye \\ncare of the last decades. one such success has been the who-endorsed \\nsafe strategy for trachoma elimination. implemented in over 30 countries, \\nit has so far resulted in eight countries eliminating trachoma as a public \\nhealth problem. other examples include publicœprivate partnerships to \\nprovide spectacles in pakistan, sri lanka, and south africa. \\nthe \\nworld report on vision\\n sets out concrete proposals to address \\nchallenges in eye care. the key proposal is to make integrated people-\\ncentred eye care, embedded in health systems and based on strong \\nprimary health care, the care model of choice and scale it up widely.  \\npeople who need eye care must be able to receive high-quality \\ninterventions without suffering ˜nancial hardship. including eye care in \\nnational health plans and essential packages of care is an important \\npart of every country™s journey towards universal health coverage.\\nwho is committed to working with countries to improve the delivery of \\neye care, in particular through primary health care; to improving health \\ninformation systems for eye care; and to strengthening the eye care \\nworkforce œthree enabling factors for implementing integrated people-\\ncentred eye care. \\nvibut who cannot achieve this task alone. international organizations, \\ndonors, and the public and private sectors must work together to \\nprovide the long-term investment and management capacity to scale \\nup integrated people-centred eye care. \\nour hope is that, building on past efforts, we can successfully take on \\nthis challenge and help countries prevent eye conditions and vision \\nimpairment more effectively and provide quality eye care services \\naccording to the needs of their populations. \\ndr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus\\n director-general\\n world health organization\\nviiacknowledgements\\nthe world health organization (who) would like to thank the more

care is projected to increase dramatically in the \\ncoming decades posing a considerable challenge to health systems. \\ndespite concerted action during the past 30 years, signi˜cant \\nchallenges remain. the \\nworld report on vision\\n seeks to stimulate action \\nin countries to address these challenges by proposing integrated \\npeople-centred eye care (ipec) as an approach to health system \\nstrengthening that builds the foundation for service delivery to address \\npopulation needs. ipec refers to eye care services that are managed \\nand delivered to assure a continuum of promotive, preventive, \\ntreatment and rehabilitative interventions against the spectrum of eye \\nconditions, coordinated across the different levels and sites of care \\nwithin and beyond the health sector, and according to their needs \\nthroughout the life course. ipec will also contribute to achieving \\nuniversal health coverage (uhc) and sustainable development goal 3 \\n(sdg3): ﬁensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all agesﬂ.\\nvision, eye conditions and vision impairment\\nvision, the most dominant of our senses, plays a critical role in every \\nfacet and stage of our lives. we take vision for granted, but without \\nvision, we struggle to learn to walk, to read, to participate in school, \\nand to work.\\nvision impairment occurs when an eye condition affects the visual \\nsystem and one or more of its vision functions. vision impairment has \\nserious consequences for the individual across the life course. many of \\nthese consequences can, however, be mitigated by timely access to \\nquality eye care and rehabilitation. \\neye conditions that can cause vision impairment and blindness œ such \\nas cataract, trachoma and refractive error œ are, for good reasons, the \\nmain focus of prevention and other eye care strategies; nevertheless, \\nthe importance of eye conditions that do not typically cause vision \\nimpairment œ such as dry eye and conjunctivitis œ must not be \\noverlooked. these conditions are frequently among the leading reasons \\nfor presentation to eye care services all countries.\\nxiglobal magnitude: eye conditions and vision \\nimpairmenteye conditions are remarkably common. those who live long enough \\nwill experience at least one eye condition during their lifetime. globally, \\nat least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness, of \\nwhom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been \\nprevented or has yet to be addressed. more reliable data on the met \\nand unmet eye care needs, however, are required for planning. also, the \\nburden of eye conditions and vision impairment is not borne equally. \\nthe burden tends to be greater in low- and middle-income countries \\nand underserved populations, such as women, migrants, indigenous \\npeoples, persons with certain kinds of disability, and in rural \\ncommunities. population growth and ageing, along with behavioural \\nand lifestyle changes, and urbanization, will dramatically increase the \\nnumber of people with eye conditions, vision impairment and blindness \\nin the coming decades.  \\nthe costs of addressing the coverage gap \\nthe costs of the coverage gap for unaddressed refractive errors and \\ncataract globally are estimated to be $14.3 billion us dollars. these are \\nthe additional costs that would be required to the current health system \\nusing an immediate time horizon. this ˜nancial investment is needed \\nimmediately; it requires appropriate planning and relies on additional \\ninvestment to strengthen existing health systems. \\ntoday, millions of people live with vision impairment or blindness that \\ncould have been prevented but, unfortunately, was not. while the exact \\nnumber is unknown, it is estimated that 11.9 million people globally have \\nmoderate or severe vision impairment or blindness due to glaucoma, \\ndiabetic retinopathy and trachoma that could have been prevented. \\nthe estimated costs of preventing the vision impairment in these \\n 11.9 million would have been us$5.8 billion. this represents a signi˜cant \\nopportunity missed in preventing the substantial personal and societal \\nburden associated with vision impairment and blindness. \\naddressing eye conditions and vision impairment\\na range of effective strategies are available to address the needs \\nassociated with eye conditions and vision impairment across the life \\ncourse. these include health promotion, prevention, treatment and \\nrehabilitation strategies, some of which are among the most feasible \\nand cost-effective of all health care interventions to implement.\\nxiisuccesses and remaining challenges in eye care\\nconcerted action during the past 30 years has yielded many successes: \\nglobal advocacy efforts have been launched; world health assembly \\nresolutions adopted; and actions plans implemented. recent scienti˜c \\nand technological developments promise to further accelerate these \\nadvances. nonetheless, progress is not keeping pace with population \\neye care needs. major challenges lie ahead. firstly, eye care needs \\nglobally will rise sharply due to changes in demographics and lifestyle. \\nsecondly, data are often lacking and health information systems weak, \\nthus hampering planning. thirdly, eye care is frequently poorly \\nintegrated into health systems, for example, in national health strategic \\nplans and health information systems; and the eye care workforce is \\npoorly coordinated.  \\nadvancing uhc through eye care\\nmaking eye care integral to uhc will contribute to reaching sdg target \\n3.8.\\n1 for this to happen quality eye care services need to be provided \\naccording to population needs and the cost of priority eye care \\ninterventions cannot expose the user to catastrophic expenditures. to \\nfacilitate the choices that countries must make when implementing uhc, \\nwho is developing an online data repository detailing who-\\nrecommended interventions and their resource implications. part of this \\nrepository will also be a package of eye care interventions which will \\ncontribute to progressing the agenda of eye care as part of uhc forward.\\nipec\\nipec can help address the signi˜cant eye care challenges that many \\ncountries face. ipec adopts a health-system perspective with four \\nstrategies: (i) engaging and empowering people and communities; (ii) \\nreorienting the model of care based on a strong primary care; (iii) \\ncoordinating services within and across sectors; and (iv) creating an \\nenabling environment, speci˜cally the inclusion of eye care in national \\nhealth strategic plans, the integration of relevant eye care relevant data \\nwithin health information systems, and the planning of the eye care \\nworkforce according to population needs.\\n1 sdg 3.8: ﬁ\\nachieve universal health coverage, including ˜nancial risk protection, access to quality \\nessential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential \\nmedicines and vaccines for all.ﬂ\\nxiiiconclusion and recommendationshealth systems face unprecedented challenges in meeting the current \\nand projected eye care needs of the world™s population. there is no \\nchoice but to take on these challenges. the premise of the world report \\non vision is that integrated people-centred eye care has the potential to \\naccelerate action and meet these challenges. for this to become a \\nreality, this report recommends ˜ve important actions:   \\n1. \\n make eye care an integral part of universal health coverage.\\n2. \\n implement integrated people-centred eye care in health systems.\\n3. \\n  \\npromote high-quality implementation and health systems research \\ncomplementing existing evidence for effective eye care \\ninterventions.  \\n4. \\n  \\nmonitor trends and evaluate progress towards implementing \\nintegrated people-centred eye care.\\n5. \\n  \\nraise awareness and engage and empower people and \\ncommunities about eye care needs.\\nxivintroduction\\neveryone, if they live long enough, will experience at least one eye \\ncondition in their lifetime that will require appropriate care. globally, at \\nleast 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness, of whom \\nat least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been \\nprevented or has yet to be addressed. tens of millions have a severe \\nvision impairment and could bene˜t from rehabilitation which they are \\nnot currently receiving. the burden of eye conditions and vision \\nimpairment is not borne equally: it is often far greater in low- and \\nmiddle-income countries, among older people and in women, and in \\nrural and disadvantaged communities. \\nfortunately, thanks to concerted action taken over the past 30 years, \\nprogress has been made in many areas. in 1999, the global initiative for \\nthe elimination of avoidable blindness, ﬁvision 2020: the right to sightﬂ, \\nintensi˜ed global advocacy efforts, strengthened national prevention of \\nblindness programmes and supported the development of national eye \\ncare plans. this momentum was maintained by four wha resolutions: \\nwha56.26 (2003); wha59.25 (2006); wha62.1 (2009), and wha66.11 \\n(2013). the 2009 and 2013 resolutions were accompanied by who \\naction plans, the most recent of which, ﬁuniversal eye health: a global \\naction plan 2014œ2019ﬂ, called for universal access to comprehensive eye \\ncare services and set an ambitious global target to reduce ﬁprevalence \\nof avoidable visual impairment by 25% by 2019ﬂ. a report presented at \\nthe seventieth wha in may 2017 detailed the considerable progress \\nmade in implementing the 2014œ2019 global action plan (resolution \\nwha66.4). at the same time, there has been a sharp increase in the \\nnumber of population-based surveys undertaken to measure vision \\nimpairment and blindness around the world. importantly, eye care has \\nbecome an area of health care with many highly cost-effective \\ninterventions for health promotion, prevention, treatment and \\nrehabilitation to address the entire range of needs associated with eye \\nconditions and vision impairment across the life course.\\nyet signi˜cant challenges remain. chief among these are inequalities in \\ncoverage; addressing unmet needs and ensuring services are planned \\nand provided according to population needs; uneven quality of eye \\ncare services; workforce shortages; fragmented services that are poorly \\nintegrated into health systems; gaps in data, particularly related to \\nmonitoring trends and evaluating progress; and lack of \\nimplementation, impact and health systems research related to eye \\ncare. in addition, population ageing (a third more people predicted to \\nbe aged over 60 years by 2030), coupled with lifestyle changes (less \\ntime spent outdoors, and increasingly sedentary life-styles and \\nxvunhealthy eating habits), are causing the number of people with eye \\nconditions and vision impairment to increase. available data provide \\nan incomplete picture of the met and unmet needs for eye care; \\nnonetheless, the health systems of countries face considerable \\nchallenges. such challenges include addressing the unmet eye care \\nneeds, continuing to provide eye care for those whose needs are being \\nmet, and preparing for a projected consistent increase in numbers of \\nthose needing eye care.\\nthe \\nworld report on vision\\n, building on achievements to date, aims to \\ngalvanize action to address these challenges. building on who™s \\nexisting framework on integrated people-centred health services, \\nintegrated people-centred eye care (ipec) is the key proposal of the \\nreport. ipec is de˜ned as services that are managed and delivered so \\nthat people receive a continuum of health promotive, preventive, \\ntreatment and rehabilitative interventions to address the full spectrum \\nof eye conditions according to their needs, coordinated across the \\ndifferent levels and sites of care within and beyond the health sector, \\nthat adopts people™s perspectives as participants and bene˜ciaries of \\nthese services, throughout their life course. ipec also has the potential to \\ncontribute to the progress towards uhc in relation to eye care and to \\nachieving sdg 3: ﬁensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at \\nall agesﬂ.\\nthe \\nworld report on vision\\n is directed at policy-makers, practitioners, \\npublic health specialists, researchers, and academics, as well as \\nministries of health, civil society, and development agencies. \\naims \\nthe overall aims of the report are: \\n     to raise awareness of the global magnitude and impact of eye \\nconditions and vision impairment and the need to address gaps in \\ndata, particularly regarding met and unmet eye care needs; \\n     to draw attention to effective strategies to respond to eye care needs; \\n     to take stock of progress, and identify the main challenges facing the \\n˜eld of eye care; \\n     to emphasize the need for making eye care an integral part of uhc;\\n     to make the case for ipec as the way forward; \\n     to make recommendations for action to be implemented by all \\ncountries to improve eye care. \\nxviscope \\nthis report makes the case that integrated people-centred eye care is \\nthe care model of choice and can help meet the challenges faced. \\nchapter 1\\n highlights the critical importance of vision; describes eye \\nconditions that can cause vision impairment and those that typically \\ndo not; reviews the main risk factors for eye conditions; de˜nes vision \\nimpairment and disability; and explores the impact of vision \\nimpairment. \\nchapter 2\\n provides an overview of the global magnitude of \\neye conditions and vision impairment and their distribution. \\nchapter 3\\n presents effective promotive preventive, treatment, and rehabilitative \\nstrategies to address eye care needs across the life course. \\nchapter 4\\n starts by taking stock of global advocacy efforts to date, the progress \\nmade in addressing speci˜c eye conditions and vision impairment, and \\nrecent scienti˜c and technological advances; it then identi˜es the \\nremaining challenges facing the ˜eld. \\nchapter 5\\n describes how making \\neye care an integral part of universal health care (including developing \\na package of eye care interventions) can help address some of the \\nchallenges faced by countries. \\nchapter 6\\n presents ipec and explains the \\nneed for engaging and empowering people and communities, \\nreorienting the model of care based on a strong primary care and the \\nneed for coordinating services within and across sectors; and creating \\nan enabling environment. \\nthe report ends with \\n˜ve recommendations for action\\n that can be \\nimplemented by all countries to improve eye care. \\nmoving forward\\nit is the intention of who and all involved in the preparation of the \\nworld report on vision,\\n that the report will lead to greater awareness and \\nincreased political will and investment to implement its \\nrecommendations for action to strengthen eye care so that the ˜eld \\ncan meet the current and future challenges it faces. \\n1chapter 1\\nvision, eye \\nconditions \\nand vision \\nimpairment\\n2in a global society built on the ability to see, \\nvision impairment has far-reaching consequences \\nfor individuals, their families and carers. \\nwhile some eye conditions cause vision \\nimpairment, many do not and yet can still lead \\nto personal and financial hardships because of \\nthe treatment needs associated to them.\\nvision impairment occurs when an eye condition \\naffects the visual system and one or more of its \\nvision functions. a person who wears spectacles \\nor contact lenses to compensate for their vision \\nimpairment, still has a vision impairment. \\nﬁdisabilityﬂ refers to the impairments, limitations \\nand restrictions that a person with an eye \\ncondition faces in the course of interacting with \\nher or his environment œ physical, social, or \\nattitudinal.\\ntimely access to quality care has a major \\ninfluence on the impact of eye conditions.\\n3vision plays a \\ncritical role in \\nevery facet and \\nstage of life.visionin a global society built on the ability to see, vision plays a critical role in \\nevery facet and stage of life. \\nvision is the most dominant of the ˜ve senses and plays a crucial role in \\nevery facet of our lives. it is integral to interpersonal and social \\ninteractions in face-to-face communication where information is \\nconveyed through non-verbal cues such as gestures and facial \\nexpressions \\n(1, 2)\\n. globally, societies are built on the ability to see. towns and cities, \\neconomies, education systems, sports, media and many other aspects \\nof contemporary life are organized around sight. thus, vision \\ncontributes towards everyday activities and enables people to prosper \\nat every stage of life. \\nfrom the moment of birth, vision is critical to child development. for \\ninfants, visually recognizing and responding to parents, family \\nmembers, and caregivers facilitates cognitive and social development \\nand the growth of motor skills, coordination and balance \\n(3)\\n.  from early childhood to adolescence, vision enables ready access to \\neducational materials and is pivotal to educational attainment \\n(4, 5)\\n. vision supports the development of social skills to foster friendships, \\nstrengthen self-esteem and maintain well-being \\n(6)\\n. it is also important \\nfor participation in sports and social activities that are essential to \\nphysical development, mental and physical health, personal identity \\nand socialization \\n(7)\\n.in adulthood, vision facilitates participation in the workforce, \\ncontributing to economic bene˜ts and a sense of identity \\n(8, 9)\\n. it also \\ncontributes towards the enjoyment of many other areas of life that are \\noften designed around the ability to see, such as sports or cultural \\nactivities. \\nlater in life, vision helps with maintaining social contact and \\nindependence \\n(10-12)\\n and facilitates the management of other health \\nconditions \\n(13-15)\\n. vision also helps to sustain mental health and levels of \\nwell-being, both of which are higher among those with good vision \\n(16-18)\\n. 4eye conditions \\nwhile some eye conditions cause vision impairment, many typically do \\nnot yet can still lead to personal and ˜nancial hardships.  \\neye conditions encompass a large and diverse range of morbidities \\nthat affect different components of the visual system and visual \\nfunction \\n(box 1.1).\\n given their range, classifying eye conditions is a \\nchallenge; one way is to distinguish conditions that do not typically \\ncause vision impairment from those that can (\\ntables 1.1\\n and 1.2)\\n. the importance of eye conditions that typically do not cause vision \\nimpairment should not be understated. these conditions can be \\ntroublesome and painful, and are frequently among the leading \\nreasons for presentation to eye care services in all countries. for \\nexample, published data from the emergency departments of major \\nhealth facilities in the high-income countries of australia, the united \\nstates of america and saudi arabia reveal that conjunctivitis, a \\ngenerally benign and self-limiting condition, is the most common \\nreason for patient presentation \\n(19-22)\\n. data gathered from health \\nfacilities in low- and middle-income countries show similar trends, with \\neye conditions that are typically non-vision-threatening, such as \\nconjunctivitis, lid abnormalities, pterygium and dry eye, consistently \\nranked among the top reasons for clinic attendance \\n(23-27)\\n. eye conditions that can cause vision impairment and blindness are, \\nwith good reason, the main focus of prevention and intervention \\nstrategies. notable, however, is that a considerable proportion of \\npeople with eye conditions in this category who receive timely diagnosis \\nand treatment will not develop vision impairment or blindness. for \\nexample, of the estimated 196 million people globally with age-related \\nmacular degeneration \\n(28)\\n, 10.4˚million (5.3%) have moderate or severe \\ndistance vision impairment or blindness from more severe forms of the \\ncondition \\n(29)\\n. similarly, an estimated 64 million people globally have \\nglaucoma \\n(30)\\n, of which 6.9 million (10.9%) only are reported to have \\nmoderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness resulting \\nfrom more severe forms of the condition \\n(29)\\n.also worthy of mention, is that certain conditions that do not typically \\ncause vision impairment \\n(as described in table 1.1)\\n, may do so, if left \\nuntreated. for example, untreated cases of a form of conjunctivitis \\ncaused by gonococcal infection can result in vision impairment when \\nbacteria penetrates the cornea causing corneal ulceration and scarring \\n(31)\\n. this emphasizes the importance of early identi˜cation and timely \\ntreatment for all eye conditions \\n(as discussed in chapter˚3).\\nsome eye \\nconditions cause \\nvision impairment, \\nmany do not.\\n5box 1.1 the visual system and vision functions\\nvisual system\\nthe visual system encompasses the eyes, optic nerves, and pathways to and \\nbetween different structures in the brain. structures at the front of the eye \\n(the cornea and lens) focus light entering the eye onto the retina. in the \\nretina, light is converted into nerve impulses which travel through the optic \\nnerves and pathways to a speci˜c part of the brain known as the visual \\ncortex. these impulses are then transmitted to many other parts of the brain \\nwhere they integrate with other inputs (such as from hearing or memory) to \\nenable a person to understand the surrounding environment and respond \\naccordingly.\\nvision functions\\nthe visual system enables the vision functions which support a variety of \\nactivities and occupations:\\n švisual acuity is the ability to see details clearly, regardless of the distance \\nof the object. \\n ˜distance visual acuity is used in many everyday situations, such as \\nreading a blackboard, signposts or bus numbers, or when recognizing \\npeople across a room. it is important for many occupations and \\nrecreational activities, such as playing sports. \\n ˜near visual acuity is important for all near tasks, such as reading and \\nwriting. it is also used in many occupations and recreational activities, \\nsuch as tea picking, sorting grains and using mobile phones and \\ncomputers. \\n šcolour vision has a very practical role, allowing differentiation of objects of \\na similar size and shape, such as medication; it is also important for \\noccupations such as electrical work, aviation and fashion. \\n šstereopsis/binocular vision (depth perception) allows judgement of \\ndistances and the speed of approaching objects. it is important for many \\nnear tasks, such as pouring liquids into a glass or threading a needle. \\n šcontrast sensitivity refers to the ability to distinguish an object from its \\nbackground, which may often involve distinguishing shades of grey. it is \\nespecially important in situations of low light, such as driving at night. \\n švision in the peripheral visual ˜elds, as well as the central part of the visual \\n˜eld, assists in moving around safely, by detecting obstacles and \\nmovement in a person™s side vision. it is important for safe driving and for \\nmany occupations and sports.\\n6common eye conditions that do not typically \\n cause vision impairment (table 1.1)\\nblepharitis\\nin˛ammation of the eyelids near the base of the eyelashes characterized \\nby redness and irritation of the eye and eyelid.\\nchalazion and hordeolum (stye) \\ncommon eyelid disorders resulting from a blocked gland or localized \\ninfection that can cause pain.\\nconjunctivitis\\nin˛ammation of the conjunctiva (the clear membrane lining the inside of \\nthe eyelids and covers the white part of the eye) most commonly caused \\nby allergy or infection.\\ndry eye\\ndue to an inadequate tear production that can result in irritation and \\nblurred vision.\\npterygium and pinguecula\\nabnormal growths on the conjunctiva that can cause pain. in advanced \\ncases, pterygium can encroach on the cornea and cause vision loss.\\nsubconjunctival haemorrhage\\nbroken blood vessels underneath the conjunctiva.\\n7common eye conditions that can cause vision impairment \\n including blindness (table 1.2)\\nage-related macular degeneration\\ndamage to the central part of the retina responsible for detailed vision \\nleads to dark patches, shadows or distortion of the central vision. the risk \\nof developing macular degeneration increases with age. \\ncataract\\ncloudiness in the lens of the eye, leading to increasingly blurred vision. the \\nrisk of developing cataract increases with age. \\ncorneal opacity\\na group of conditions causing the cornea to become scarred or cloudy. \\nopacity is most commonly caused by injury, infection or vitamin a \\nde˜ciency in children. \\ndiabetic retinopathy\\ndamage to blood vessels in the retina which become leaky or blocked. \\nvision loss most commonly occurs due to swelling in the central part of the \\nretina which can lead to vision impairment. abnormal blood vessels can \\nalso grow from the retina, which can bleed or cause scarring of the retina \\nand blindness.\\nglaucoma\\nprogressive damage to the optic nerve. initially, loss of vision occurs in the \\nperiphery and can progress to severe vision impairment (this is known as \\nopen angle glaucoma, the most common type and the type generally \\nreferred to in this report). \\nrefractive error\\ndue to an abnormal shape or length of the eye ball; light does not focus \\non the retina resulting in blurred vision. there are several types of refractive \\nerror; those most commonly referred to in this report are:\\nœ  myopia\\n œ dif˜culty seeing distant objects (near-sightedness).\\nœ  presbyopia\\n œ dif˜culty seeing objects at near distance with increasing age \\n(i.e. after 40 years of age).\\ntrachoma\\ncaused by a bacterial infection. after many years of repeated infections, \\nthe eyelashes can turn inwards (known as trichiasis) which can lead to \\ncorneal scarring and, in some cases, blindness.\\n78risk factors for, and causes of, eye conditions \\nrisk factors for, and causes of, eye conditions include ageing, genetics, \\nlifestyle exposure and behaviours, infections, and various health \\nconditions. many eye conditions are multifactorial in origin. \\nmany risk factors increase the likelihood of developing, or contributing \\nto the progression of, an eye condition. these include ageing, lifestyle \\nexposure and behaviours, infections, and a range of health conditions. \\nageing is the primary risk factor for many eye conditions. the \\nprevalence of presbyopia, cataract, glaucoma and age-related \\nmacular degeneration increase sharply with age \\n(28, 30, 32, 33)\\n. genetics also play a role in the development of some eye conditions \\nincluding glaucoma, refractive error and retinal degenerations such as \\nretinitis pigmentosa \\n(34-36)\\n. ethnicity \\n(30)\\n is an example of another \\nnon-modi˜able risk factor that is related to a greater risk of developing \\nsome eye conditions.\\nlifestyle exposures or behaviours are also linked to many eye \\nconditions. smoking is the primary modi˜able risk factor for age-related \\nmacular degeneration \\n(37)\\n and plays a part in the development of \\ncataract \\n(38)\\n. nutrition may also play an important role in eye \\nconditions. for example, vitamin a de˜ciency, resulting from chronic \\nmalnutrition in children, can cause corneal opacity \\n(39)\\n. additionally, \\noccupations and recreational activities, such as farming or mining and \\ncontact sports, are linked consistently to greater risk of ocular injury \\n(40)\\n.ocular infections from bacterial, viral or other microbiological agents \\ncan affect the conjunctiva, cornea, eyelids and, more rarely, the retina \\nand optic nerve; conjunctivitis is the most common of these \\n(41)\\n. trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide, is \\ncaused by the bacterium \\nchlamydia trachomatis\\n (42)\\n. environmental risk \\nfactors, including hygiene, sanitation and access to water, are also \\nimportant in in˛uencing the transmission of the trachoma bacterium \\n(43)\\n. other infections that can cause vision impairment and blindness \\ninclude measles \\n(44)\\n, onchocera volvulus\\n (45)\\n and the \\ntoxoplasma gondii\\n parasites \\n(46)\\n, to name a few.\\ncertain health conditions may lead to a range of ocular manifestations; \\nthese include, but are not limited to, diabetes \\n(47)\\n, rheumatoid arthritis \\n(48)\\n, multiple sclerosis \\n(49)\\n and pre-term birth \\n(50).\\n additionally, some \\nmedications increase the susceptibility of developing certain eye \\nconditions; the long-term use of steroids, for example, increases the risk \\nof developing cataract \\n(51)\\n and glaucoma \\n(52)\\n.the origins of many eye conditions are multifactorial, with a range of \\nrisk factors interacting to increase both the susceptibility to, and the \\nprogression of, a condition. diabetes duration, high haemoglobin a1c, \\nand high blood pressure, for example, are important risk factors for \\ndiabetic retinopathy \\n(53)\\n. another example is myopia, where an \\nageing is the \\nprimary risk \\n factor for many \\neye conditions.\\n9interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors, including \\nintensive near vision activity (as a risk factor) and longer time spent \\noutdoors (as a protective factor), may play an important role in the \\nonset and progression of the condition \\n(36)\\n. access to quality eye care is a signi˜cant factor in the risk of progression \\nof eye conditions and treatment outcomes \\n(54-57)\\n. effective interventions \\nare available to prevent, treat, and manage most major eye conditions \\n(further details are provided in chapter 3)\\n. it is important to note that \\nalthough some conditions, such as trachoma, can be prevented, others, \\nsuch as glaucoma or cataract, cannot, but can be treated to reduce the \\nrisk of vision impairment.\\n10vision impairment \\nvision impairment occurs when an eye condition affects the visual \\nsystem and one or more of its vision functions.\\naccording to the international classi˜cation of functioning, disability \\nand health (icf), an ﬁimpairmentﬂ is a general term used to describe a \\nproblem\\n in the function or structure of a person™s body due to a health \\ncondition \\n(58).\\n this de˜nition is compatible with the international \\nclassi˜cation of diseases 11th edition (icd 11) \\n(59)\\n. accordingly, a vision \\nimpairment results when an eye condition affects the visual system and \\none or more of its vision functions. \\ntypically, population-based surveys measure visual impairment using \\nexclusively visual acuity, with severity categorized as mild, moderate or \\nsevere \\ndistance\\n vision impairment or blindness, and \\nnear\\n vision \\nimpairment \\n(box 1.2).\\n however, in the clinical setting, other visual \\nfunctions are also often assessed, such as a person™s ˜eld of vision, \\ncontrast sensitivity and colour vision. \\nbox 1.3 \\nprovides details of the evolution of the concept and de˜nition of \\nvision impairment during the past few decades.\\nit is important to note that, as described in box 1.4, most published data \\non ﬁvision impairmentﬂ are based on measures of ﬁpresenting visual \\nacuityﬂ and do not include individuals whose vision impairment is \\ncompensated for with spectacles or contact lenses. for this reason, \\nthere is no global estimate of the total number of people with vision \\nimpairment (see chapter 2). previously, it was appropriate for the eye \\ncare ˜eld to rely on ﬁpresenting visual acuityﬂ because it provided an \\nestimate of the unmet eye care needs. however, to plan services and \\nmonitor progress effectively, it is important to have information on both \\nthe met and the unmet needs of eye care. this is particularly important \\ngiven that individuals with refractive errors have an ongoing need for \\neye care services.\\nvision impairment \\noccurs when an \\neye condition \\naffects the visual \\nsystem and one or \\nmore of its vision \\nfunctions.11box 1.2 visual acuity measurement, and classi˜cation table for \\nthe severity of visual impairment\\nvisual acuity\\nvisual acuity is a simple, non-invasive measure of the visual system™s ability \\nto discriminate two high contrast points in space.\\ndistance visual acuity\\n is commonly assessed using a vision chart at a ˜xed \\ndistance (commonly 6 metres (or 20 feet) \\n(55)\\n. the smallest line read on the \\nchart is written as a fraction, where the numerator refers to the distance at \\nwhich the chart is viewed, and the denominator is the distance at which a \\nﬁhealthyﬂ eye is able to read that line of the vision chart. for example, a visual \\nacuity of 6/18 means that, at 6 metres from the vision chart, a person can \\nread a letter that someone with normal vision would be able to see at 18 \\nmetres. ﬁnormalﬂ vision is taken to be 6/6. \\nnear visual acuity\\n is measured according to the smallest print size that a \\nperson can discern at a given test distance \\n(60)\\n. in population surveys, near \\nvisual impairment is commonly classi˜ed as a near visual acuity less than n6 \\nor m 0.8 at 40 centimetres \\n(61)\\n, where n refers to print size based upon the \\npoint system as used in the printing business and 6 is a font size equivalent \\nto newspaper print.\\nclassi˜cation of severity of vision impairment based on visual acuity in the \\nbetter eye\\ncategory\\nvisual acuity in the better eye\\nworse than:\\nequal to or \\n better than:\\nmild vision \\n impairment\\n6/12 \\n6/18 \\nmoderate vision \\n

degree of visual impairment \\nand blindness according to the above classi˜cation table using visual acuity \\n(61)\\n. severe visual impairment and blindness are also categorized according \\nto the degree of constriction of the central visual ˜eld in the better eye to less \\nthan 20 degrees or 10 degrees, respectively\\n (62, 63)\\n.12box 1.3. evolution of the classi˜cation of vision impairment \\nthe classi˜cation of vision impairment using visual acuity has changed \\n over time: \\n šin 1972, a who study group established categories of vision impairment \\nand blindness in order to facilitate the collection of population-based \\n data in a uniform format. at that time, the prevalence of vision impairment \\nwas calculated based on best-corrected (i.e. tested with spectacles if \\nusually worn, or a pinhole) in the better eye. the cut-off for categorizing \\nvision impairment was a best-corrected visual acuity of less than 6/18, \\nwhile blindness was categorized as a best-corrected visual acuity of less \\nthan 3/60.\\n šin 2010, the classi˜cation of vision impairment was updated based on the \\npremise that (i) the use of ﬁbest correctedﬂ visual acuity overlooks a large \\nproportion of people with vision impairment due to uncorrected refractive \\nerror; and (ii) there was no distinction between those who have varying \\nlevels of  blindness (e.g. no perception of light and those that have light \\nperception but still measure less than 3/60 in the better eye). as a result, \\nﬁbest-correctedﬂ visual acuity was replaced with ﬁpresentingﬂ visual acuity \\n(i.e. the visual acuity of a person as she or he presents to the examination); \\nblindness was further subcategorized into three distinct levels of severity.\\n šrecently, some investigators have adopted a more stringent cut-off for \\ncategorizing vision impairment (i.e. a visual acuity of less than 6/12 in the \\nbetter eye) in recognition of a growing body of evidence that milder \\nreductions in visual acuity impacts every day functioning of individuals.\\nbox 1.4 changing the way vision impairment is reported\\nthe measure of vision impairment typically reported in population-based \\nsurveys is based on visual acuity in the better eye of a person as presented in \\nexamination. if spectacles or contact lenses are worn œ for example to \\ncompensate for vision impairment caused by a refractive error œ visual acuity \\nis measured with the person wearing them; thus they will be categorized as \\nnot having a vision impairment. \\nmeasuring ﬁpresenting visual acuityﬂ is useful for estimating the number of \\npeople who need eye care, including refractive error correction, cataract \\nsurgery or rehabilitation. however, it is not appropriate for calculating the \\ntotal number of people with vision impairment. for this reason, the term \\nﬁpresenting distance vision impairmentﬂ is used in this report, but only when \\ndescribing previous published literature that de˜nes vision impairment \\nbased on the measure of ﬁpresenting visual acuityﬂ.\\nto calculate the total number of people with vision impairment, visual acuity \\nneeds to be measured and reported without spectacles or contact lenses.\\n13much of the published literature does not report on unilateral vision \\nimpairment, with most opting to focus solely on bilateral vision \\nimpairment. however, a (smaller) body of literature \\n(64)\\n shows that \\nunilateral vision impairment impacts on visual functions, including \\nstereopsis (depth perception) \\n(64)\\n. as with bilateral vision impairment, \\npersons with unilateral vision impairment are also more prone to issues \\nrelated to safety (e.g. falls) and maintaining independent living \\n(65). \\nfurther studies report that patients who undergo cataract surgery in \\nboth eyes have more improved functioning than patients who undergo \\nsurgery in one eye only \\n(66).\\n vision impairment can worsen as an underlying eye condition \\nprogresses. nevertheless, effective interventions are available for most \\neye conditions that lead to vision impairment. these include:\\na)\\n  \\nrefractive errors, the most common cause of vision impairment, can \\nbe fully compensated for with the use of spectacles or contact \\nlenses, or corrected by laser surgery.\\nb)\\n  \\nvision impairment caused by some age-related conditions, such as \\nglaucoma, have no cure and cannot be corrected. however, \\neffective treatments and surgical interventions are available which \\ncan either delay or prevent progression. \\nc)\\n  \\nvision impairment caused by other age-related conditions, such as \\ncataract, can be corrected through surgical interventions. given \\nthat cataracts worsen over time, people left untreated will \\nexperience increasingly severe vision impairment which can lead to \\nblindness and signi˜cant limitations in their overall functioning.\\nin cases where vision impairment or blindness cannot be prevented œ \\nsuch as advanced age-related macular degeneration (particularly the \\nﬁdryﬂ form of the condition) œ rehabilitation services are required to \\noptimize functioning in everyday life.\\nthe examples described above underscore two important issues: ˜rst, \\neffective interventions exist for the vast majority of eye conditions that \\ncan cause vision impairment; and secondly, access to interventions can \\nsigni˜cantly reduce, or eliminate, vision impairment or its associated \\nlimitations in functioning. the range of available interventions are \\ndescribed in more detail in \\nchapter 3.\\n14vision impairment and disability \\ndisability refers to the impairments, limitations and restrictions that a \\nperson with an eye condition faces in the course of interacting with her \\nor his environment œ physical, social, or attitudinal.\\nin the icf, disability encompasses impairments, the dif˜culties a person \\nmay have in carrying out activities such as self-care, and the problems \\nthey experience in involvement in everyday life situations, such as going \\nto school or work \\n(67)\\n.1 according to the icf, the disability experienced is \\ndetermined not only by the eye condition, but also by the physical, \\nsocial and attitudinal environment in which the person lives, and the \\npossibility of accessing quality eye care, assistive products (such as \\nspectacles), and rehabilitation services. \\na person with an eye condition experiencing vision impairment or \\nblindness and facing environmental barriers, such as not having access \\nto eye care services and assistive products, will likely experience far \\ngreater limitations in everyday functioning, and thus higher degrees of \\ndisability.\\naddressing the eye care needs of people with vision impairment or \\nblindness, including rehabilitation, is of utmost importance to ensure \\noptimal everyday functioning. in addition, an urgent need is required for \\na broad societal response to ful˜l the rights of persons with long-term \\nimpairments (as required by the convention on the rights of persons \\nwith disabilities (crpd)), so that people with severe vision impairment or \\nblindness participate in society on an equal basis with others. \\nconsequences for individuals \\nvision impairment has serious consequences across the life-course, \\nmany of which can be mitigated by timely access to quality eye care \\nand rehabilitation.\\nnot meeting the needs, or ful˜lling the rights, of people with vision \\nimpairment, including blindness, has wide-reaching consequences. \\nexisting literature shows that insuf˜cient access to eye care and \\nrehabilitation and other support services can substantially increase the \\nburden of vision impairment and degree of disability at every stage of \\nlife \\n(68, 69)\\n.young children with early onset severe impairment can experience \\ndelayed motor, language, emotional, social and cognitive development \\n(70)\\n, with lifelong consequences. school-age children with vision \\nimpairment can also experience lower levels of educational achievement \\n(71, 72)\\n and self-esteem than their normally-sighted peers \\n(73)\\n. 1 this is consistent with the understanding of disability in the united nations \\nconvention on the rights of persons with disabilities. \\ndisability refers to \\nthe impairments, \\nlimitations and \\nrestrictions that \\n a person with an \\neye condition \\n faces in the course \\nof interacting \\n with her or his \\nenvironment œ \\nphysical, social, \\n or attitudinal.\\n15studies have consistently established that vision impairment severely \\nimpacts quality of life (qol) among adult populations \\n(10, 65, 74-76) \\nand \\na large proportion of the population rank blindness as among their \\nmost feared ailment, often more so than conditions such as cancer \\n(77, \\n78)\\n. adults with vision impairment often have lower rates of workforce \\nparticipation and productivity \\n(79, 80)\\n and higher rates of depression \\nand anxiety \\n(16-18)\\n than the general population. in the case of older \\nadults, vision impairment can contribute to social isolation \\n(81-83)\\n, dif˜culty walking \\n(84)\\n, a higher risk of falls and fractures, particularly hip \\nfractures \\n(85-91)\\n and a greater likelihood of early entry into nursing or \\ncare homes \\n(92-94)\\n. it may also compound other challenges such as \\nlimited mobility or cognitive decline \\n(95, 96)\\n. in general terms, people with severe vision impairment experience \\nhigher rates of violence and abuse, including bullying and sexual \\nviolence \\n(97-100)\\n; are more likely to be involved in a motor vehicle \\naccident \\n(101, 102)\\n; and can ˜nd it more dif˜cult to manage other health \\nconditions, for example being unable to read labels on medication \\n(13-15)\\n. while the number of people with severe vision impairments is \\nsubstantial, the overwhelming majority have vision impairments that are \\nmild or moderate \\n(61)\\n. yet very little is known about the consequences of \\nmild and moderate vision impairment on, for example, infant and child \\ndevelopment, educational achievement, workforce participation, and \\nproductivity. nonetheless, it is evident that, without access to quality eye \\ncare and provision of proper spectacles or contact lenses, mild or \\nmoderate vision impairment can affect signi˜cantly an individual™s \\ncognitive, social and economic well-being \\n(103)\\n.  impact on family members and carers \\nsupport from family members, friends, and other carers is often crucial \\nbut can have an adverse impact on the carer.\\nfamily members, friends and other carers are often responsible for \\nproviding physical, emotional and social support for those with severe \\nvision impairment \\n(104)\\n. examples of such support include \\naccompanying children to school; assistance with activities of daily \\nliving (e.g. shopping, cooking, cleaning); ˜nancial help to buy assistive \\ndevices to improve their functioning in the home, to increase their \\nattendance at medical and/or rehabilitation services, to pay for \\nexternal carers; and emotional support during dif˜cult times \\n(104, 105)\\n.evidence suggests that support from family members has a positive \\nin˛uence on those with vision impairment and can lead to improved \\nadaptation to vision impairment, greater life satisfaction \\n (106, 107)\\n, fewer depressive symptoms \\n(106)\\n and improved uptake of \\nrehabilitative services and assistive products \\n(108)\\n. however, providing \\nsuch support may have detrimental consequences on the caregiver \\nvision impairment \\nhas serious \\nconsequences \\nacross the life-\\ncourse, many of \\nwhich can be \\nmitigated by \\ntimely access to \\nquality eye care \\nand rehabilitation.\\n16and lead to an increased risk of physical and mental health conditions \\n(109),\\n such as anxiety \\n(110)\\n and depression \\n(111)\\n. this is more likely to occur \\nwhen the caregiver has dif˜culty balancing their own needs with those \\nof the family member, or when money is short \\n(104)\\n.over and above the support of family, friends and other care givers, \\n a societal response is essential. member states need to recognize their \\nobligations to ful˜l all the requirements contained in the 31 articles of \\nthe crpd.\\nimpact on societythe 2017 global burden of disease (gbd) study ranked vision \\nimpairment, including blindness, the third cause among all \\nimpairments for years lived with disability \\n(112)\\n. in addition, the societal \\nburden of vision impairment and blindness is substantial given its \\nimpact on employment, qol and the related caretaking requirements. \\nvision impairment also poses an enormous global ˜nancial burden as \\ndemonstrated by previous research that has estimated costs of \\nproductivity loss \\n(79, 80, 113, 114)\\n. for example, a recent study among \\nnine countries estimated that the annual cost of moderate to severe \\nvision impairment ranged from us$˚0.1 billion in honduras to as high as \\nus$˚16.5 billion in the united states of america \\n(113)\\n, while annual global \\ncosts of productivity losses associated with vision impairment from \\nuncorrected myopia and presbyopia alone were estimated to be \\nus$˚244 billion and us$˚25.4 billion, respectively \\n(79, 80)\\n. of particular \\nnote, the economic burden of uncorrected myopia in the regions of east \\nasia, south asia and south-east asia were reported to be more than \\ntwice that of other regions and equivalent to more than 1% of gross \\ndomestic product \\n(80)\\n. vision impairment \\nposes an enormous global ˜nancial \\nburden due to \\nproductivity loss. \\n17references\\n1.\\n desrosiers j,

2\\nglobal magnitude: \\n eye conditions \\n and vision impairment\\n222323globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a vision \\nimpairment, of whom at least 1 billion have a \\nvision impairment that could have been \\nprevented or has yet to be addressed. \\neye conditions are remarkably common. yet \\naccurate estimates of the global magnitude of \\neye conditions are lacking. \\nthe burden of most eye conditions and vision \\nimpairment is not borne equally. inadequate \\naccess to eye care is a major cause of the \\nuneven distribution.\\nan improved understanding of the magnitude of \\neye care needs that are currently being met by \\nthe health system is critical for effective \\nplanning.\\neye care is a good investment. preventing eye \\nconditions and vision impairment will lead to \\nimproved productivity and reduce informal and \\nintangible costs. \\nin the coming decades, if the projected increase \\nin older people is not met with increased access \\nto eye care services, there will be a substantial \\nincrease in the number of people with vision \\nimpairment and blindness.\\n24eye conditions \\nare remarkably \\ncommon.global magnitude: eye conditions\\neye conditions are remarkably common. yet estimates of the global \\nmagnitude of some eye conditions are lacking. \\neveryone, if they live long enough, will experience at least one eye \\ncondition in their lifetime. for example, many people will have had \\nconjunctivitis as a child, will need spectacles due to presbyopia at some \\npoint after 40 years of age, or require cataract surgery later in life. \\nestimates of the number of people globally with eye conditions that can \\ncause vision impairment demonstrate just how common such \\nconditions are \\n(fig. 2.1)\\n (1œ7)\\n. however, since a person can have more \\nthan one eye condition, these ˜gures cannot simply be summed to \\nderive a global estimate of the total number of people affected by eye \\nconditions that can cause vision impairment. global estimates of the \\nnumber of people with, and prevalence of, at least one eye condition \\nare not available. \\nalthough reliable global estimates are lacking for the prevalence of eye \\nconditions that do not typically cause vision impairment but are \\ncommon reasons for care-seeking behaviour, some data are available. \\na review of 20 population-based studies from around the world \\nestimated the global prevalence of pterygium to be 10.2% \\n(9)\\n, with rates \\nranging from 2.8% in an urban area of australia, to as high as 33% in \\nrural china \\n(10, 11)\\n. subnational epidemiological data on the prevalence \\nof dry eye syndrome among adults aged 40 years and older have also \\nbeen documented in many countries, with rates as low as 8% reported \\nin

5, 6)\\n. however, rates of \\ncataract and trachomatous trichiasis are higher among women, \\nparticularly in low- and middle-income countries \\n(26-28)\\n. women may \\nbe more susceptible to trachoma than men due to greater contact with \\nchildren in their role of the primary caretaker of the household \\n(26)\\n. while greater life expectancy may contribute to the higher prevalence \\nof cataract among women in these settings, other factors have also \\nbeen implicated (details provided below). \\n32by area of residence\\narea of residence is an important determinant of many eye conditions. \\nfor example, trachoma is largely found in poor, rural communities that \\nhave inadequate access to water, sanitation and health care \\n(29)\\n. rural \\npopulations also face greater barriers to accessing eye care due to \\ndistances to travel and poor road quality, among other factors \\n(30, 31)\\n. therefore, it is not surprising that a lower cataract surgical coverage \\nand associated higher prevalence of cataract has been reported in \\nrural areas of many countries \\n(27, 28, 32, 33)\\n. area of residence may \\nlikewise be an important determinant of childhood myopia. unlike \\ncataract, higher rates of childhood myopia have been found in urban \\npopulations of china and australia \\n(34-38)\\n. these may be due to the \\nimpact of lifestyle differences

impairment for these groups. however, \\nthose that do consistently report higher rates of \\npresenting distance \\nvision impairment\\n among these population subgroups \\n(40-43).\\n for \\nexample, recent epidemiological surveys conducted in australia (2015), \\nand chiapas state, mexico (2015) \\n(44, 45)\\n, reported rates of \\npresenting \\ndistance vision impairment\\n in indigenous adult populations \\napproximately two times higher than in the general population. in line \\nwith these ˜ndings, a survey in nakuru, kenya reported the odds of \\nbeing blind were 2.5 times higher in indigenous kalenjin people than in \\nthe non-indigenous population \\n(46)\\n. there is some evidence from high-income countries that ethnic \\nminorities are more commonly af˛icted by vision impairment. for \\nexample, africanœamerican and hispanic individuals residing in the \\nunited states of america experience a higher prevalence of \\npresenting \\ndistance vision impairment\\n and blindness when compared with non-\\nhispanic caucasian individuals \\n(47)\\n. while, in the united kingdom, those \\nof african descent and south asian heritage with diabetes are reported \\nto have a higher prevalence of vision impairment \\n(42)\\n.35by age and gender\\ngiven that age is the principal risk factor for many eye conditions, the \\nprevalence of \\npresenting distance vision impairment\\n is much greater in \\nolder age groups. it has been estimated that 80% of bilateral \\npresenting \\ndistance vision impairment\\n and blindness, and two thirds of near vision \\nimpairment occur in persons aged 50 years or older \\n(47, 48)\\n. while the \\nprevalence of \\npresenting distance vision impairment\\n in this age group \\nhas been studied extensively, comparatively little population-based \\ndata are available for vision impairment for all ages. \\nwomen, on average, live longer than men, and are thus at greater risk \\nof developing eye conditions associated with ageing. for example, in a \\nnational survey in nigeria, the prevalence of mild and moderate \\npresenting distance vision impairment\\n in women was approximately 30% \\nhigher than in men \\n(49)\\n. however, even after controlling for age, global \\nestimates suggest that women with moderate and severe \\npresenting \\ndistance vision impairment\\n outnumber men by approximately 7% \\n(15)\\n. by area of residence\\nthere is a paucity of recent survey data from countries making direct \\n(i.e. within survey) comparisons of the prevalence of vision impairment \\nand blindness between urban and rural populations. however, previous \\nstudies that have, including those conducted in china \\n(50)\\n and ghana\\n (51)\\n, indicate that people in rural areas are at higher risk of distance \\nvision impairment and blindness than their urban counterparts. in \\naddition, indirect (i.e. between survey) comparisons between urban \\nand rural populations in the same country supports the view that vision \\nimpairment tends to be more prevalent amongst rural populations. for \\nexample, in india, the age-speci˜c prevalence of \\npresenting distance \\nvision impairment\\n in an urban population of delhi (19.7% in 60-69 year \\nolds) was approximately one-third lower than that of a rural population \\nin northern india (28% in 60-69 year olds) \\n(52, 53).\\n 36access and barriers to eye care services \\nthe use of eye care services is uneven, and is determined by the \\navailability, accessibility, affordability, and acceptability of such services. \\nthe prevalence of eye conditions and vision impairment is in˛uenced by \\nthe use of eye care services that prevent vision impairment or maintain \\nor restore vision. the signi˜cant variations in the use of eye care services \\nexisting between populations contribute to those in the distribution of \\neye conditions and vision impairment. \\nseveral national and subnational surveys have reported the use of eye \\ncare services being generally greater in high-income than in low- and \\nmiddle-income countries \\n(54-60)\\n. cataract surgery coverage rates œ an \\nindicator of eye care service provision within populations œ also show \\nmarked variations by income level: subnational population surveys \\nconducted in viet nam, yemen and malawi reported rates lower than \\n40%, while rates higher than 80% were reported in countries such as \\nuruguay, argentina and australia \\n(61, 62)\\n. it is important to emphasize \\nthat there some are exceptions: a sub-national survey from iran, for \\nexample, reported cataract surgery coverage rates of over 90% \\n(62)\\n.the use of eye care services is in˛uenced by multiple interdependent \\nfactors, including the availability, accessibility, affordability, and \\nacceptability of services. the impact of these factors on the distribution \\nof eye conditions and vision impairment is discussed in this section.\\navailability\\na shortage of trained human resources is one of the greatest \\nchallenges to increasing the availability of eye care services and \\nreducing the prevalence of vision impairment and blindness that could \\nhave been prevented or has yet to be addressed. the distribution of the \\neye care workforce should be based on population needs. \\nunfortunately, this is not the case currently \\n(63-65)\\n. for example, in \\nmany countries, eye care needs are higher in rural settings where there \\nare very few health workers involved in eye care \\n(63, 65, 66)\\n. globally, ophthalmologists are responsible primarily for performing eye \\nsurgery and treating all common eye conditions, such as glaucoma, \\ndiabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. a recent \\n(2019) study of the ophthalmology workforce covering 198˚countries (i.e. \\n94% of the global population) reported that, while the number of \\npractising ophthalmologist is increasing in most countries, there is \\ninequitable distribution, and a signi˜cant shortfall in the current and \\nprojected number of ophthalmologists \\n(67)\\n. this is particularly important \\neye conditions and \\nvision impairment \\nare in˚uenced by \\nthe use of eye care \\nservices.\\n37the integration of \\neye care services \\nwithin primary \\nhealth care is \\nfundamental.in many low- and middle-income countries. critical human resource \\nshortages have also been identi˜ed for optometrists and other allied \\nophthalmic personnel, such as opticians, refractionists, orthoptists, \\nophthalmic assistants, ophthalmic nurses etc \\n(68, 69)\\n. several of these are \\nthe key professional groups involved in the management of refractive \\nerror worldwide. due to this serious shortage of ophthalmologists and \\noptometrists, other allied ophthalmic personnel play a major role in the \\nprovision of a broad range of eye care services, particularly in low- and \\nmiddle-income countries, and at primary health care (phc) level.\\neven where health workers are available, essential ophthalmic \\nequipment to manage ocular conditions frequently is not, particularly in \\nthe public sector of some low- and middle-income settings \\n(70)\\n. for \\nexample, the results of an ophthalmic equipment survey of 173 health \\ncare settings (56% tertiary hospitals) located predominantly in regions \\nof africa (70.5%) and south-east asia (13.3%) revealed that more than \\n60% of services did not have a photocoagulation laser œ a primary \\nintervention for vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy \\n(70, 71)\\n. a recent \\nnational survey of practice patterns and management of glaucoma in \\nnigeria reported that only approximately 30% of ophthalmologists had \\naccess to laser equipment, while basic diagnostic equipment was not \\navailable in 15œ20% of clinics \\n(72)\\n. a considerable shortage of corneal graft tissue and limited access to \\ncorneal transplant programmes also exist in many countries\\n9. improved \\ndata on donation rates and population needs, coupled with clear \\npolicies and legislation and supportive governance oversight on both \\ndonation and transplantation, are required for member states to \\nestablish sustainable corneal banking programmes.\\nthe reality that the vast majority of eye care services in low- and \\nmiddle-income countries are provided in secondary or tertiary \\nhospitals, which are principally located in urban areas, adds to the \\ninequity in access. this highlights the importance of both strengthening \\nthe integration of eye care services within primary health care, and \\nensuring an effective referral pathway to secondary and tertiary care \\nsettings for timely treatment of eye conditions. \\naccessibility \\nmany barriers œ related, for example, to gender, socioeconomic status, \\nand perceived cost of eye care œ can prevent patients from accessing \\nservices. in some settings, women do not have the same access to eye \\nservices as men. reviews of population-based surveys conducted in \\nlow- and middle-income countries consistently reported that women \\nare signi˜cantly less likely to undergo cataract surgery than men \\n(28, \\n62)\\n. this gender inequity in the use of eye care services could be \\n9 gain p, jullienne r, he z, aldossary m, acquart s, cognasse f, et al. global survey \\nof corneal transplantation and eye banking. jama ophthalmol. 2016;134(2):167-73.\\n38explained by a range of socioeconomic and cultural factors, including \\ngreater challenges for women in travelling to health services due to \\nlimited ˜nancial decision-making power and minimal experience in \\ntravelling outside their community \\n(73, 74)\\n. this gender disparity is not \\npresent in all countries, however: recent reports from high-income \\nsettings in australia and canada found that men used eye care \\nservices less frequently than women \\n(54, 75)\\n. a growing body of \\nevidence also suggests that people who have disabilities, such as a \\nhearing, physical, or intellectual disability, face greater challenges in \\naccessing eye care services than those who do not \\n(76-79)\\n.socioeconomic status has also consistently been reported as a key \\ndeterminant of the use of eye care services \\n(56, 80, 81)\\n, with a tendency for \\neye care use to decrease with increasing socioeconomic disadvantage.\\npoor eye health literacy is associated with suboptimal adherence to eye \\nexamination guidelines, and poorer eye health outcomes \\n(82-84)\\n. additionally, lack of knowledge of the availability of services has been \\nidenti˜ed as a barrier to eye care use among high risk populations, \\nincluding homeless \\n(85, 86)\\n and refugee \\n(87)\\n populations in high-\\nincome countries. older people tend to use eye care services less \\nfrequently, often considering a reduction in vision as part of the normal \\nageing process, and unaware that many eye conditions can be treated \\nor that rehabilitation may improve their functioning \\n(88)\\n. in the absence of accessible eye care services, people with eye or vision \\nproblems, particularly in low-income settings, resort to self-medication \\nusing local remedies, or access local informal providers such as drug \\nsellers, or traditional or spiritual healers. these interventions can be \\nharmful and can also delay accessing more appropriate care. for \\nexample, in the nigeria national survey almost half of the participants \\nwho had undergone a procedure for cataract had been couched (a \\ntraditional procedure) and almost three quarters of these eyes were \\nblind \\n(89)\\n.perceived high costs have been cited as a barrier to accessing eye care \\nin a number of settings \\n(90-92). \\nin some cases, for example treating \\ncataract or diabetic retinopathy, the costs combined with the lack of \\nsuf˜cient information about the bene˜ts may result low willingness to \\npay associated to insuf˜cient information about the bene˜ts \\n(33, 93, 94)\\n.affordabilityaffordability of eye care services is in˛uenced by income level, direct \\ncosts (e.g. costs of treatment, or purchasing spectacles, contact lenses \\nor low vision devices), indirect costs, and health insurance status. many \\neye conditions, such as refractive error and diabetic retinopathy, affect \\nadults of working age. therefore, it is not surprising that indirect costs of \\ncare, including the loss of productivity and foregone earnings for the \\npeople who have \\ndisabilities face \\ngreater challenges \\nin accessing eye \\ncare services than \\nthose who do not.39direct costs, \\nincluding \\ntransport to \\nappointments \\n and related \\npharmaceutical \\ninterventions \\n are barriers to \\naccessing care.\\npatient and caregiver, are common reasons for non-attendance at eye \\ncare appointments \\n(94, 95)\\n. in other circumstances, a failure to access \\ncare can be more an issue of opportunity costs, where basic living \\nneeds (e.g. food production for family) outweigh concerns related to \\neye health \\n(96)\\n.direct costs, including costs involved in accessing eye care, transport to \\nappointments and related pharmaceutical interventions, have also been \\ncited extensively as primary barriers to accessing care, particularly in \\nlow- and middle-income countries \\n(33, 94)\\n. this may be partly explained \\nby the fact that approximately 50% of people in low- and middle-income \\ncountries live more than one hour of a city (compared with 10% in \\nhigh-income countries) \\n(97)\\n, making transport to eye care services \\nchallenging. nonetheless, direct costs have also been cited as a key \\nbarrier to accessing eye care in high-income countries, particularly for \\npeople living in rural areas or those with low socioeconomic status \\n(98)\\n. further evidence of the impact of direct eye care costs is found in \\nstudies that have reported consistently that patients without health \\ninsurance have notably lower rates of use of eye care services than \\nthose with insurance \\n(58, 99, 100)\\n. this becomes a greater issue when \\nservices in the public sector are limited due to human resource \\nshortages and when most people either do not have the required \\nhealth insurance coverage for, or cannot afford, treatment in the \\nprivate-for-pro˜t sector. a recent review of health system dynamics in \\ntrinidad and tobago revealed that private sector optometrists and \\nophthalmologists provide 80% of all eye care, while less than 20% of the \\nadult population were reported to have health insurance that covers \\ncare provided by the private sector \\n(101)\\n. it is therefore unsurprising that \\na recent population-based survey in trinidad and tobago reported \\nthat a lack of health insurance was a key risk factor for vision \\nimpairment among adults \\n(102)\\n.acceptabilitythe acceptability of eye care is seldom considered but has substantial \\nconsequences on the use of services and subsequent eye health \\noutcomes. it is a multifaceted concept that is related to the characteristics \\nof the health workforce (e.g. sex, language, culture, age); the degree to \\nwhich a person understands an intervention; and whether the person \\nconsiders the intervention will achieve the expected outcome \\n(103)\\n.previous literature has reported that the acceptance of wearing \\nspectacles is often in˛uenced by factors such as cosmesis, the belief \\nthat spectacles identify the wearer as having a disability, or that vision \\nworsens with continued spectacle wear \\n(104, 105)\\n. a distrust of service \\nquality has been cited as a barrier to the uptake of eye care services. \\nfor example, a study among children in china reported that a low \\nacceptance of free or low-cost spectacles was related to parental \\n40beliefs that the spectacles were of poor quality \\n(106)\\n. a distrust of service \\nquality, along with fear of the procedure, have also been cited \\nconsistently as barriers to the uptake of cataract surgery and other \\nservices in many countries \\n(106-108)\\n. the role of cultural factors in health service acceptability has also been \\nexplored. for example, indigenous peoples are more likely to access eye \\ncare if it is culturally appropriate and well-integrated within their \\ncommunity-based health service \\n(109)\\n. similarly, higher levels of patient \\nengagement and satisfaction have been reported when there is \\nconcordance in language and/or ethnicity between patients and health \\ncare professional \\n(110)\\n. in some cultures, gender-sensitivities may also \\narise when care is provided by a health care worker of the opposite \\ngender.\\nacceptance of \\nwearing spectacles \\nis often in˚uenced \\nby factors such as \\ncosmesis, the \\nbelief that \\nspectacles identify \\nthe wearer as \\nhaving a disability, \\nor that vision \\nworsens with \\ncontinued \\nspectacle wear.\\n41population ageing, \\ncoupled with \\nenvironmental and \\nlifestyle changes, \\nwill lead to a \\ndramatic increase \\nin the number of \\npeople with vision \\nimpairment and \\nblindness.projections of eye conditions\\npopulation ageingpopulation ageing will impact signi˜cantly the number of people with \\neye conditions. by 2030, the number of people worldwide aged 60 \\nyears and over is estimated to increase from 962 million (2017) to \\n 1.4 billion, while numbers of those aged over 80 years will increase from \\n137 million (2017) to 202 million \\n(111)\\n. these population changes will lead \\nto considerable increases in the numbers of people with major eye \\nconditions that cause vision impairment. \\nthe number of people with the age-related eye condition glaucoma, \\nfor example, has been projected to increase 1.3 times between 2020 \\n (76 million) and 2030 (95.4 million); and those with age-related macular \\ndegeneration, 1.2 times between 2020 (195.6 million) and 2030 \\n (243.3 million) \\n(fig. 2.6)\\n (1, 6)\\n. similarly, the number with presbyopia is \\nprojected to increase from 1.8 billion in 2015, to 2.1 billion in 2030 \\n(8). as \\nmost people over the age of 70 will develop cataract, the number with \\nthis condition will also increase substantially. population ageing will also \\nlead to an increase in the number of people with other eye conditions, \\nincluding those that do not usually cause vision impairment, such as \\ndry eyes. \\n42figure 2.6 projected number of people worldwide with glaucoma and

work and increased rates of urbanization, among other \\nfactors, may contribute towards a substantial increase globally in the \\nnumber of people with myopia. according to estimates that take into \\naccount the growth in urbanization and in the human development \\nindex, the number of people with myopia will increase from 1.95 billion \\nin 2010 (uncertainty interval (ui) 1422 million to 2543 million) to \\n 3.36 billion in 2030 (ui 153 million to 589 million) \\n(3)\\n. during the same \\nperiod, the number of people with high myopia, often associated with \\nsevere complications, is

increase in the number of people \\nwith diabetes across all countries during the past thirty years \\n(112)\\n. if \\ntrends continue, the number of people with diabetic retinopathy is \\nestimated to increase from 146 million in 2014 to 180.6 million in 2030 \\n(1.2-fold) \\n(113)\\n. 43health systems face \\nunprecedented \\nchallenges in \\nmeeting the current \\nand projected \\ndemands of

that could have been prevented \\nor has yet to be addressed, and tens of millions of others with vision \\nimpairment or blindness who could bene˜t from rehabilitation œ health \\nsystems are also

health \\nsystems will be required to collect data systematically on the met needs \\nin order to be able to conduct effective planning.\\nageing, population growth, and the fact that the prevalence of vision \\nimpairment and many eye conditions increases in older age, will also \\nlead to a substantial increase in the number of people that need eye \\ncare globally. anticipated increases in the

few eye conditions can be prevented (e.g. \\ntrachoma and most causes of corneal opacity in children), this is not \\npossible for most. each eye condition requires a different response.\\nfortunately, there are effective interventions covering promotion, \\nprevention, treatment and rehabilitation which address the needs \\nassociated with eye conditions and vision

adults and children are illustrated \\nin \\ntable 3.1\\n. health promotioninterventions for health promotion have the potential to increase the \\nadoption of healthy behaviours that affect eye conditions and vision \\nimpairment, as well as the uptake of eye care services.\\ninterventions for health promotion aim to empower people to increase \\ncontrol over their health and its promotive factors through health \\nliteracy efforts, rather than by targeting speci˜c risk factors or health \\nconditions. to date, interventions for health promotion in the ˜eld of eye \\ncare have received less attention and investment than those for \\nprevention and treatment \\n(1, 2).\\n thus, it is unsurprising that eye- and \\nvision-related outcomes are not included in the evaluation of health \\npromotion programmes. although public health education campaigns \\nlinking smoking and blindness have proved effective in increasing \\nawareness and encouraging smokers to seek cessation supports \\n(3-5)\\n, there is no evidence to suggest that such interventions impact the \\nprevalence of vision impairment. \\nonly a few key evaluated examples of interventions for health \\npromotion have been found successful in increasing the adoption of \\nhealth promoting behaviours and the uptake of eye care services \\n(6). \\nhealth promotion campaigns targeting improved awareness of the \\nimportance of regular eye examinations and the use of eye care \\nservices have been shown to be effective among older populations and \\nthose with diabetes \\n(7, 8)\\n. the use of health

previously endemic \\ncountries through the implementation of preventative \\ninterventions \\nbrief history\\nlandmark trials in the 1990s demonstrated the effectiveness of the antibiotic

sanitation) to reduce \\nchlamydia trachomatis \\ntransmission \\n(26)\\n. the who alliance for the global elimination of trachoma by 2020 (get2020) \\nwas established in 1996 and, soon after, the

estimated number of people worldwide living in districts \\nwhere the a, f and e components of safe need to be implemented for \\ntrachoma elimination purposes has decreased from 1517 million in 2002 to \\n 142 million in 2019, while the number of people with trichiasis has fallen from \\n7.6 million to 2.5 million in the same period \\n(14)\\n. eight countries œ cambodia, \\nghana, the islamic republic of iran, lao people™s democratic republic, \\nmexico, morocco, nepal and oman œ have now been validated by who as \\nhaving eliminated trachoma as a public health problem; a further ˜ve œ

and \\nprogression.\\ntreatment\\nthe treatment of eye conditions targets curing as well as addressing \\nsymptoms and progression. treatment also aims to prevent or slow \\nprogression towards vision impairment. \\ncataract and refractive error are the two leading causes of vision \\nimpairment; treatment can address vision impairment and restore \\nvision. treatment for cataract is a surgical intervention involving the \\nremoval of the opaque lens in the eye and the implantation of an \\narti˜cial intraocular lens. cataract surgery is highly cost-effective \\n(29)\\n and results in signi˜cant improvements to qol \\n(30)\\n. while spectacles are \\nundoubtedly the most common intervention used worldwide to \\ncompensate for refractive error \\n(box 3.3),\\n contact lenses and laser \\nrefractive surgery are an effective alternative and becoming increasing \\npopular, particularly in high-income settings \\n(31).\\n treatment for other noncommunicable eye conditions are often more \\nchallenging, with longer-term follow-up essential to slow the progression \\nof the condition. for example, the prevention of vision impairment from \\ndiabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and retinopathy of prematurity, requires \\nearly detection, often before the patient is symptomatic. for diabetic \\nretinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, this involves routine \\nscreening to detect the ﬁvision-threateningﬂ stages of the condition, \\nfollowed by laser therapy or other treatments to reduce the risk of vision \\nimpairment or blindness \\n(32, 33)\\n (box 3.2)\\n. in the case of glaucoma, \\nongoing management is required to reduce the risk of further \\nprogression through a number of possible interventions including a \\ntherapeutic eye drop regimen, laser therapy, surgery, or a combination \\nof these \\n(34)\\n. effective therapeutic interventions, in the form of continuous \\nor intermittent anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-vegf) \\nintraocular injections, are currently available for the neovascular form of \\nage-related macular degeneration (amd) (only) \\n(35, 36)\\n. treatment is available for many eye conditions that do not typically \\ncause vision impairment, such as dry eye, conjunctivitis and blepharitis. \\ntreatment of these conditions is often directed at alleviating the \\nsymptoms. in advanced cases of pterygium when vision is affected, \\nsurgical intervention is often required \\n(37)\\n. research has demonstrated \\nthat the treatment of eye conditions that do not typically cause vision \\nimpairment can pose a substantial economic burden on the patient \\nand on society \\n(38)\\n.56box 3.2 long-term impact of retinal screening on diabetes-related \\nvisual impairment in the working age population: the english \\nnational screening programme \\n(39) \\na national systematic diabetic retinopathy screening programme was \\nestablished in england in 2003 where all individuals with diabetes aged 12 \\nyears and over are invited for an annual diabetic eye screening \\nappointment. in line with current recommendations for high resource \\nsettings, patients are sent reminders to attend screening. since 2008, the \\nprogramme has achieved near comprehensive population coverage (i.e. \\n>80% annual coverage).\\nin the programme, screening is performed by well-trained screeners who \\nmeasure visual acuity, instil drops for pupil dilation, carry out two-˜eld retinal \\nphotography. images are then digitally transferred to a centralized location \\n(e.g. established grading centre) for retinal grading by specially trained \\nnon-physician technicians. prior to their involvement in the programme, a \\nminimum quali˜cation is required for screeners and graders \\n(40)\\n. in addition, \\nall graders undertake monthly test sets of images and their results are \\ncompared to a guide grade. audit and internal and external quality \\nassurance schemes are also embedded in the service. \\nrobust sensitivities and speci˜cities for the detection of diabetic retinopathy \\nand sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy (moderate disease or worse) \\nhave been reported in this programme \\n(41)\\n. individuals with sight-threatening \\ndiabetic retinopathy are referred for timely ophthalmology assessment and \\nmanagement. in addition, all those with poor-quality images are referred for \\nassessment of retinal status via slit lamp examination. \\nin 2015-16, the diabetic retinopathy screening programme in england \\nscreened 2 144 007 people with diabetes (83% coverage) \\n(39)\\n. after 7 years of \\nscreening for treatable diabetic retinopathy, a review of the blindness \\nregistry in england revealed that the condition was no longer the most \\ncommon cause of blindness in the working age population \\n(42)\\n. this \\nprovides compelling evidence that systematic diabetic retinopathy \\nscreening, coupled with timely treatment of sight-threatening disease, can \\nreduce vision impairment and blindness.\\n57box 3.3 spectacles\\nwho considers spectacles or contact lenses \\nfunctioning interventions\\n, as \\nthey do not eliminate or cure refractive error by treating its causes \\n(43)\\n; rather they are used to compensate for common refractive errors such as \\nmyopia, hypermetropia and presbyopia. in the same way, the incorporation \\nof prisms into spectacles can be used to compensate for double vision that \\noccurs due to a range of causes.\\nspectacles are also used in the context of vision rehabilitation. this comes, \\nfor example, in the form of convex lenses that are incorporated into \\nspectacles to magnify the image to help individuals with low vision to \\nperform their near-tasks comfortably. \\nspectacles are also an assistive device and are part of the who priority \\nassistive products list.\\n1 who de˜nes assistive devices and technologies as \\nthose whose primary purpose is to maintain or improve the functioning and

\\nrehabilitation will \\nbe required.\\nrehabilitationvision impairment and blindness caused by many major eye conditions \\n(e.g. glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration) cannot be \\ntreated, and rehabilitation will be required. \\nrehabilitation aims to optimize the everyday functioning of those with \\nvision impairment or blindness that cannot be treated in their \\nenvironment, by maximizing the use of residual vision and providing \\npractical adaptations to address the social, psychological, emotional, \\nand economic consequences of vision impairment \\n(45)\\n. the main eye conditions causing vision impairment in adults, and \\naddressed by vision rehabilitation, are glaucoma, amd, corneal \\nopacities and diabetic retinopathy. the main conditions in children and \\nyoung adults include congenital, genetic, and acquired eye conditions.\\na broad range of vision rehabilitation interventions are available, \\nincluding optical magni˜ers, environmental modi˜cation (e.g. improved \\nlighting), reading using braille, screen readers, smartphone way˜nders, \\ncounselling and home skills training, such as orientation and mobility \\ntraining with white canes to ensure safe ambulation \\n(46, 47)\\n. many eye \\nconditions can impact different components of vision function (e.g. \\nvisual acuity, contrast, peripheral vision), thus vision rehabilitation \\ninterventions need to be tailored to individual needs and priorities. \\nvision rehabilitation interventions greatly assist people with a visual \\nimpairment and blindness \\n(48, 49)\\n. additional research is required, \\nhowever, to determine not only the most ef˜cient and cost-effective \\ninterventions but also optimal outcome measures for rehabilitation \\n(50, \\n51)\\n. who is currently developing a package of evidence-based \\nrehabilitation interventions to include vision rehabilitation \\n(52)\\n. a case \\nexample of an integrated low vision rehabilitation service is provided in \\nbox 3.4\\n.59box 3.4 an integrated low-vision rehabilitation service: a case \\nexample from sri lanka \\n(53) \\nprior to 2008, vision rehabilitation services for the whole of sri lanka were \\nprovided by three low-vision clinics only, located within tertiary hospital \\nsettings. however, when sri lanka™s ˜rst national eye care plan was \\ndeveloped in 2007, low vision was included and the necessary links with \\neducation, rehabilitation, and social services were established. \\nwith support from international ngos and the ministry of health (moh), the \\nstrengthening of sri lanka™s vision rehabilitation services began in 2008. \\ninitially, this involved solidi˜cation of the existing tertiary level services, so \\nthey could competently provide visual skills training, orientation and mobility \\ntraining, and counselling services for people with low vision. following this, \\nten secondary level clinics, with strong referral links to the three tertiary \\nclinics, were then established within existing district hospitals. existing eye \\ncare practitioners from the eye units of these hospitals were trained to \\nprovide the services, including comprehensive low-vision assessment, \\nprescription and dispensing of low-vision devices, as well as training in the \\nuse of such devices. people with complicated needs were referred to the \\nnearest tertiary low-vision clinic for further management.\\nthe establishment of these clinics improved the accessibility of vision \\nrehabilitative services across the country and, within only two years following \\nimplementation, nearly 8000 people (of whom 10% were children) with vision \\nimpairment had received low-vision rehabilitation services. while it is \\nacknowledged that this is a small proportion only of the total number of \\npeople with vision impairment in sri lanka, it represents a ˜ve-fold increase in \\nthe number of people accessing low-vision rehabilitation

neovascular (ﬁwetﬂ). effective therapeutic options, \\nwhich are currently only available for neovascular amd, consist of repeated \\ninjections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) agents. anti-\\nvegf treatment and monitoring requires optical coherence tomography \\n(oct) imaging, which are not commonly available in many low- and \\nmiddle-income countries and there is a

eliminating avoidable blindness by 2020. \\nthe initiative has been pivotal in achieving uni˜ed and coordinated \\nadvocacy for key priorities for action in the ˜eld of eye care at a global, \\nregional and national level; it has been also been instrumental in \\nstrengthening national prevention of blindness programmes, \\ncommittees and focal points, as well as supporting the development of \\nnational eye care plans and advocating for stronger evidence in the \\n˜eld. four wha resolutions adopted in 2003 (wha56.26), 2006 \\n(wha59.25), 2009 (wha62.1) and 2013 (wha66.11) have maintained this \\nmomentum \\n(2, 3)\\n. while the aims and principles of the original initiative have remained \\nthe same, they have been built upon with additional plans over the \\nyears. the initial vision 2020 initiative concentrated on the main causes \\nof blindness for which cost-effective interventions were available, such \\nas cataract, trachoma, onchocerciasis and childhood blindness. \\nsubsequently, in recognition of the importance of noncommunicable \\nconditions and the impact milder forms of vision loss on qol, the 2006 \\nplans focused not only on the elimination of avoidable blindness, but \\nalso included vision impairment, particularly the correction of refractive \\nerror.\\nthe wha resolutions of 2009 and 2013 were accompanied by who \\naction plans which identi˜ed clear objectives and activities for member \\nstates, the who secretariat and international partners. the most recent \\naction plan, \\nuniversal eye health: a global action plan 2014œ2019 (3)\\n, included a further dimension around universal access to \\ncomprehensive eye care services and set an ambitious global target to \\nreduce the ﬁprevalence of avoidable visual impairment by 25% by 2019ﬂ.\\nglobal concerted \\naction during the \\npast 30 years has \\nresulted in \\nprogress in many \\nareas.\\n74evidence of the impact of these concerted efforts was presented to \\nmember states at the seventieth wha in may 2017 in a report \\nhighlighting the progress made towards achieving the indicators \\nincluded within the 2014œ2019 global action plan (resolution wha66.4). \\nat the assembly, 56 member states reported having developed a \\nnational eye health plan, or strategies supported by the action plan, \\nwhile many others re˛ected the action plan within their broader \\nnational health plans. more than 50 member states also reported that \\nestablishing a national eye health committee or a similar coordinating \\nmechanism had been critical to implementing the action plan \\n(4)\\n.the consistent call for more evidence on visual impairment and eye \\ncare services has led to a signi˜cant increase in the number of \\npopulation surveys undertaken to measure blindness and vision \\nimpairment, with more than 60 population-based surveys from 35 \\ncountries being conducted since 2010 (and approximately 300 surveys \\nfrom 98 countries since 1980) \\n(5)\\n. knowledge generated through these \\nsurveys has been pivotal to increasing advocacy and informing suitable \\npublic health strategies. \\neye conditions and vision impairment\\nsubstantial progress has been made in addressing speci˜c eye \\nconditions and vision impairment. the number of children and adults \\nwith eye infections and blindness due to vitamin a de˜ciency \\n(6)\\n, onchocerciasis \\n(7)\\n and trachoma \\n(8, 9)\\n has decreased in all regions \\nduring the past 30 years \\n(10)\\n. this is due to the implementation of \\nlarge-scale public health initiatives that have led to improvements in \\nhygiene measures, nutrition and immunization coverage, as well as the \\ndistribution of antibiotics, ivermectin, and vitamin a. in addition to the \\nsuccesses of the preventive interventions for active trachoma, the \\nnumber of people worldwide who need operations for trachomatous \\ntrichiasis has decreased substantially during the past decade: from \\n 8.2 million in 2007 \\n(8) to 2.5 million in 2019 \\n(11)\\n. cataract is the leading cause of blindness globally and has been a \\nprimary focus of many programmes aimed at meeting the vision 2020 \\nobjectives. as a result, many low- and middle-income countries have \\nseen substantial increases in rates of cataract surgery \\n(12, 13)\\n. for \\nexample, india was successful in increasing its cataract surgery rate by \\nalmost nine-fold between 1981 and 2012 \\n(14)\\n. these endeavours have \\nresulted in modest reductions in the global proportion of cases of vision \\nimpairment and blindness attributable to cataract between 1990 and \\n2015 \\n(15)\\n. it is clear that investments during the past 30 years have produced \\nconsiderable dividends, with a recent meta-analysis of population-\\nbased studies for the gbd reporting an ongoing reduction in the \\nage-standardized prevalence of distance vision impairment and \\n75blindness among the adult population since 1990 (3.83% in 1990 \\ncompared with 2.90% in 2015) \\n(5)\\n. furthermore, modest reductions have \\nbeen achieved in the proportion of adults with vision impairment or \\nblindness speci˜cally due to preventable or treatable causes \\n(5)\\n. it is \\nimportant to note, however, that reductions in prevalence are not \\nkeeping pace with population ageing and growth, thus, the number of \\nadults affected by vision impairment is increasing. \\nscienti˜c and technological advancesscienti˜c and technological advances have also opened a wide range \\nof clinical and research opportunities in the ˜eld of eye care. for \\nexample, optical coherence tomography has signi˜cantly shaped the \\nclinical practice of eye care during the past 15 years \\n(16)\\n, assisting \\ndiagnosis of a range of eye conditions and guiding treatment regimens \\nfor glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular \\ndegeneration. the adoption of telehealth solutions has been effective in \\nimproving access to a range of eye care services, particularly for those \\nliving in rural\\n and remote areas of many countries \\n(17œ19). \\nseveral \\nemerging technologies in the ˜eld of eye care, including the use of \\nmobile-based software applications for vision assessment \\n(20, 21)\\n and \\ncataract surgery benchmarking \\n(22)\\n, and arti˜cial intelligence \\ntechnologies for the detection of a range of eye conditions including \\ndiabetic retinopathy \\n(23œ26)\\n, offer further hope for enhancing access \\nand quality of health care to the most neglected communities. \\nhowever, further research is required in real-world settings prior to \\nwidespread adoption of these technologies. the use of big data \\nanalytics also has the potential to improve knowledge of service use \\nand the surveillance and aetiology of eye conditions \\n(27)\\n, and for the \\nmonitoring surgery outcomes \\n(28)\\n.in the context of treatment, advances in surgical techniques for \\ncataract, coupled with improvements in intraocular lens design and the \\nincreased availability of low-cost, high-quality intraocular lenses \\n(29)\\n, has led to signi˜cant improvements (in terms of the quality of visual \\noutcome of patients, safety and surgical volume) in cataract surgical \\nservice delivery \\n(30, 31)\\n. the introduction of anti-vegf injections has \\nrevolutionized the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and \\nresulted in a reduction in the incidence of blindness from neovascular \\nage related macular degeneration in high-income countries \\n(32, 33)\\n. nonetheless, while it is clear that both anti-vegf therapy and optical \\ncoherence tomography play a major role in the prevention of blindness, \\ncurrently their accessibility is scarce in many low- and middle-income \\ncountries due to cost implications \\n(34, 35)\\n. scienti˜c advances in \\ntreatment for people with human immunode˜ciency virus (hiv) has \\nrendered hiv-related ocular infections largely prevented, although \\nimmune recovery uveitis has emerged as a complication \\n(36)\\n. further \\nscienti˜c advances in the ˜elds of nanomedicine and tissue engineering \\n76offer hope for improvements in treatment of glaucoma and age-\\nrelated macular degeneration, and surgery for corneal opacities \\n(37œ39)\\n. technology advances have changed vision rehabilitation. the \\ndevelopment of smart phones, voice recognition, and accessibility \\nfeatures in computer operating systems, have dramatically enhanced \\naccess to information and communication for individuals with vision \\nimpairment and blindness \\n(40)\\n. digital audio books are widely available \\nin increasing numbers for those with print-reading disability. individuals \\nwith vision impairment can navigate using gps, or use electronic canes \\nto assist in detecting nearby obstacles \\n(41)\\n. although further research is \\nrequired, retinal implants could potentially offer an innovative solution \\nto restoring sight to those with little functional vision \\n(42)\\n.it is important to recognize that the examples provided here are by no \\nmeans exhaustive, and as a result of the rapid pace of innovation in the \\n˜eld of eye care, there are likely to be further noteworthy technological \\nadvances during the coming decades. \\n77challenges remain \\nin ensuring that \\nquality services \\nare planned and \\nprovided \\naccording to \\npopulation needs.challenges moving forward\\nwhile it is evident that substantial progress has been made to improve \\naccess to eye care services, this has not kept pace with population eye \\ncare needs.\\n1 as outlined in \\nchapter 2\\n, at least 1 billion people worldwide \\nhave vision impairment that could have been prevented or has yet to \\nbe addressed. furthermore, global eye care needs will increase \\nsubstantially due to increasing urbanization, demographic and \\nbehavioural and lifestyle trends.\\nchanging population demographicsas described in \\nchapter 2\\n, the number of people aged 60 years and \\nover is estimated to increase by 54%: from 962 million in 2017, to 1.4 \\nbillion in 2030, and to 2.1 billion by 2050 \\n(43)\\n. an increase in life \\nexpectancy and population growth will compound the situation. \\ntherefore, despite the interval improvements in the age-standardized \\nprevalence of vision impairment described earlier, the combination of a \\ngrowing and ageing population will signi˜cantly increase the total \\nnumber of people with eye conditions and vision impairment, since \\nprevalence increases as people age \\n(5)\\n. despite being more feasibly addressed, cataract and uncorrected \\nrefractive error remain major items on the un˜nished agenda of public \\nhealth \\n(44, 45)\\n. close to 200 million people worldwide currently have \\nmoderate to severe presenting distance vision impairment or blindness \\ncaused by cataract or uncorrected refractive error, while an estimated \\n826 million have near vision impairment caused by unaddressed \\npresbyopia. this ˜gure is expected to increase substantially since \\ncataract and presbyopia development are an inevitable part of ageing. \\nprojected increases in myopia, however, are believed to be driven \\nlargely by environmental factors (e.g. decreased time spent outdoors \\nand increased near-work activities). \\nit is clear that there is a growing need to expand the coverage of \\ninterventions for cataract and refractive error in order to meet the \\ncurrent and future demand for these conditions; a report from the \\nunited states of america estimated that in order to maintain the current \\nsurgical coverage, an additional 4.3 million cataract operations per \\nyear will be required by 2036 \\n(46)\\n. the main challenges in meeting these \\n1 population eye care needs describes the volume and type of need for eye care from all \\nindividuals within a given population. it includes the need for eye care across all health \\nstrategies, health promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. the need for eye \\ncare can arise from eye conditions that can or do not commonly cause vision \\nimpairment, as well as other health conditions that can impact vision function, such as \\ndiabetes. \\n78in many low-\\nincome countries \\ncataract is now \\n the leading cause \\nof addressable \\nblindness in young \\nchildren, in corneal \\nscarring remains \\nthe most common \\ncause of blindness.growing demands include the ability to provide access to cataract and \\nrefractive services to underserved populations, and ensuring quality of \\nservice delivery over time \\n(47)\\n. although increases in cataract surgical \\nrates have been documented in many countries \\n(12, 13)\\n, recent evidence \\nsuggests that post-operative vision results are, at times, suboptimal \\n(47)\\n.new strategies are also needed to address the challenges related to the \\nrapid emergence of noncommunicable chronic eye conditions, such as \\ndiabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, \\ncomplications of high myopia and retinopathy of prematurity. in \\ncontrast to the single or short-term interventions required for cataract \\n(48)\\n, these conditions require a comprehensive range of interventions for \\ntheir management as well as long-term care which will have a profound \\nimpact on an already strained health system and eye care workforce. \\nbased on the projected burden of diabetes alone, it is estimated that, by \\n2040, there will be a 50% increase in the number of people worldwide \\nrequiring access to routine (i.e. yearly or biennially, depending on setting) \\nretinal examination \\n(49)\\n for diabetic retinopathy \\n(50)\\n.evidence suggests that current coverage of vision rehabilitation services \\nis poor in most countries \\n(51)\\n. the change in population demographics, \\nand subsequent rise in the number of people with vision impairment \\nthat cannot be treated, will see an increasing demand for such services. \\nlikewise, the number of people with age-related eye conditions not \\ntypically causing vision impairment (e.g. dry eye), but often requiring \\ncare due to painful and troublesome symptoms, will increase.\\nchanging priorities among child populationsof importance is the shift in eye care priorities observed among child \\npopulations in low- and middle-income countries during the past \\ncouple of decades \\n(10)\\n. in many, but not all\\n, low-income countries where \\nblindness from corneal scarring has declined due to the successful \\nimplementation of public health initiatives, cataract is now the leading \\ncause of addressable blindness in young children. despite this, due to \\nslower progress in some countries, corneal scarring remains the most \\ncommon cause of blindness \\n(52)\\n. early detection and referral is essential, \\nand tertiary eye care services for children, which are inadequate in \\nmany low-income countries, are required for the surgical management \\nand follow up.\\ndue to an increase in the number of preterm births, and survival of \\npremature babies, retinopathy of prematurity has also become a \\nleading cause of blindness among children in many middle-income \\ncountries \\n(53)\\n, and is a newly emerging challenge in several african \\ncountries \\n(54)\\n. as a result, there is greater need for high-quality neonatal \\ncare, and for integrated retinopathy of prematurity screening and \\ntreatment services with long-term follow up.\\n79the measure of \\npresenting visual \\nacuity in most \\npopulation-based \\nsurveys does not \\nallow for the total \\nnumber of people \\nwith vision \\nimpairment to \\n be calculated.as in adult populations, the number of children and adolescents with \\nrefractive error, particularly myopia, is set to increase substantially in \\ncoming decades \\n(45, 55, 56)\\n. a recent global systematic review and \\nmeta-analysis reported that the number of children and adolescents \\nwith myopia is expected to increase by 200˚million between the years \\n2000 and 2050. this increase is likely to be more marked in populations \\nundergoing rapid economic transitions (e.g. east asia) \\n(55, 56)\\n and has \\nimportant implications for planning eye care services.\\ndata challenges \\nthis section focuses on the current data challenges in the context of \\npopulation-based surveys (only). however, it must be acknowledged \\nthat the paucity of health services research and implementation \\nresearch in the ˜eld of eye care also hampers the evidence-based \\nplanning of eye care programmes and services \\n(57)\\n. as outlined earlier in this chapter, an increasing number of prevalence \\nsurveys have been conducted during the past two decades; these have \\nundoubtedly made major contributions towards the understanding of \\nthe epidemiology of vision impairment and blindness. despite these \\nachievements, robust survey data are lacking in approximately half the \\nworld™s countries \\n(58)\\n, with data gaps particularly pronounced in central \\nand southern sub-saharan africa, eastern and central europe, central \\nasia, and the caribbean \\n(5)\\n. moreover, of those countries that have \\nconducted surveys, many of their ˜ndings remain unpublished \\n(59)\\n, and \\napproximately only 15% have national-level data \\n(60)\\n. thus, smaller \\nregional surveys are often used as a proxy to report the prevalence of \\nvision impairment and blindness for the entire country. \\nas outlined in \\nchapters 1\\n and 2\\n, there are also a number of gaps in the \\nglobal epidemiology of eye conditions and vision impairment. some of \\nthese include a lack of reliable global estimates of the prevalence of (i) \\neye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment; (ii) having \\nat least one eye condition; and (iii) unilateral vision impairment and \\nblindness.\\nfurthermore, and importantly, the measure of presenting visual acuity in \\nmost population-based surveys does not allow for the total number of \\npeople with vision impairment (i.e. for those with met and unmet needs) \\nto be calculated. as a result, the important indicator of ﬁeffectiveﬂ \\ncoverage of refractive error correction cannot be reported. while this \\nindicator, along with that of effective coverage of cataract surgery, can \\npotentially be considered to monitor progress towards universal health \\ncoverage\\n (uhc, chapter 5),\\n this will only be possible if data on the total \\nnumber of people with vision impairment due to refractive error (i.e. \\nwithout using spectacles or contact lenses to compensate for the \\ncondition) are collected, reported and included in the global prevalence \\nestimates \\n(box 4.1)\\n.80the indicators of \\neffective coverage \\nof refractive error \\nand effective \\ncoverage of \\ncataract surgery \\nhave been \\nincluded in the \\nwho universal

and blindness, making it dif˜cult to compare \\n˜ndings between studies.\\n for example, the de˜nition of near vision \\n82impairment varies widely between studies in terms of the testing \\ndistance and the font size used. furthermore, surveys conducted in \\nhigh-income countries frequently employ more stringent visual acuity \\ncut-offs for distance vision impairment. greater standardization of \\nde˜nitions of near and distance vision impairment is required. \\nmost surveys do not incorporate provisions for sample \\nstrati˜cation to account for heterogeneous populations. \\nassuming \\nhomogeneity may result in an insuf˜cient quanti˜cation of the burden \\nof vision loss in some of the countries™ most vulnerable groups, such as \\nindigenous populations, ethnic minorities, people living in poverty and \\npeople with disabilities. to reduce inequality, it is important to identify \\nwhich subgroups of the population are less able to access eye care \\nservices.\\nprevious prevalence surveys have infrequently assessed and \\nreported potential non-response bias, making it dif˜cult to \\ninterpret the representativeness of the results.\\n a recent review of 92 \\nblindness prevalence surveys undertaken in low- and middle-income \\ncountries and published between 2009 and 2017 \\n(61)\\n identi˜ed that less \\nthan a quarter of researchers report response bias œ i.e. the difference \\nbetween people who participate (ﬁrespondersﬂ) and those who do not \\n(ﬁnon-respondersﬂ) œ in ways that affect prevalence estimates. \\nthere is a paucity of population-based data reporting vision \\nimpairment for all ages \\n(62, 63)\\n. to date, the vast majority of survey \\nmethodologies have been undertaken for population subgroups aged \\n50 years and over, due to the fact that an estimated 80% of vision \\nimpairment occurs in this age group. despite this, it is well-established \\nthat eye conditions and vision impairment from uncorrected or under-\\ncorrected refractive error and diabetic retinopathy is common at much \\nyounger ages. in order to target effectively the needs of people at critical \\nperiods throughout the life course, epidemiological studies may need to \\nbe more inclusive of younger populations. alternatively, there may be \\nopportunities to include modules on eye care in child health surveys.\\nefforts are already underway to strengthen survey designs to address \\nmany of these limitations \\n(64)\\n; recommended case de˜nitions for near \\nand distance vision impairment have now been included in the 11th \\nrevision of the icdœ11.\\n2 the ˜eld would also bene˜t from the \\ndevelopment of an eye care survey handbook to support researchers in \\nthe conduct of epidemiological studies, including the provision of \\nguidance on study design, survey planning and implementation and \\npossible data collection tools, while taking into consideration factors \\nsuch as complexity and cost. this would ensure that comparable \\ninformation is collected and reported and would facilitate future \\nestimations of the global prevalence of vision impairment and other \\nimportant service coverage indicators. \\n2 see: \\nhttps://www.who.int/classi˜cations/icd/en/\\n.83eye care is not \\ntypically included \\nin health strategic \\nplans.integrationeye care is not typically included in health strategic plans.\\nwhile the 2014œ2019 global action plan \\n(3)\\n promoted the implementation \\nof integrated national eye health policies, plans and programmes, much \\nneeds to be done in countries for effective integration. strategic plans for \\neye care are not currently included in health sector strategic plans in \\nmost low- and middle-income countries. it can be assumed that if eye \\ncare is not included in health strategic plans, it will frequently not be \\nincluded in the planning and budgeting of services. \\nvertical programmes \\nvertical initiatives tend to be short to medium term and have been \\nsuccessful in some situations, most often where there is infectious \\ntransmission of a condition \\n(65)\\n or where the existing health \\ninfrastructure is so weak that there is nothing on which to build or \\nintegrate services \\n(66)\\n. for example, vertical (disease-speci˜c) \\nprogrammes have been used as a common and successful model in \\neye care for speci˜c conditions such as trachoma and onchocerciasis \\n(65, 67)\\n.however, for the most part, these programmes do not address eye care \\nneeds across the life course or those associated with ageing and \\nchronic disease; moreover, they appear to have failed to reduce health \\ninequalities between socioeconomic groups in low- and middle-income \\ncountries. at times, there may also be perverse incentives that \\ncompromise quality and patient safety to achieve high outputs. in \\naddition, vertical programmes can be poorly aligned with population \\neye care needs \\n(68œ70)\\n. increasing access to services requires renewed efforts to integrate eye \\ncare, not only into the planning of the health sector in general, and into \\nspeci˜c health programmes in particular (e.g. neonatal care, \\nnoncommunicable diseases, primary care and rehabilitation) but also \\ninto other sectors, such as education. for example, while there are an \\nincreasing number of examples of large scale and effective eye \\nscreening exist in the context of school health programmes \\n(71)\\n, availability is still lacking in many low- and middle-income countries. in \\nlight of the increasing number of children and adolescents with \\nrefractive error, high-quality and cost-effective school-based eye-care \\nlinked to service provision is of the utmost importance. this requires \\ncooperation between the ministries of health and education, coupled \\nwith a national eye-care plan that includes school eye health \\n(71, 72)\\n. although there are some successful examples of eye-care interventions \\nbeing delivered through other health services \\n(73)\\n, to date, progress has \\nbeen slow in the eye care sector which may re˛ect a disconnection with \\nthe rest of the health system.\\n84most eye care \\ndelivery focuses \\n on the provision \\n of curative \\ninterventions at \\nthe secondary \\n and tertiary levels \\nof the health \\nsystem and is \\noften restricted to \\nurban and larger \\nregional settings.\\ninequalities in access to eye care services\\nas outlined in \\nchapter 2\\n, persistent inequalities remain between different \\nsubgroups of the population in accessing eye care services. in general, \\nthose not able to access eye care services as required include people \\nliving in rural areas, those with low incomes, women, older people, \\npeople with disabilities, ethnic minorities, and refugees. consequently, \\nthey have far higher rates of vision impairment and blindness \\n(5, 74, 75)\\n. despite this, the consideration of equity in eye care plans is currently \\nweak \\n(76)\\n. for example, one third of countries (9/27, 59% low income or \\nlow- to middle-income) that completed the who eye care service \\nassessment tool (ecsat) between 2014œ16 reported that there were no \\ngovernment measures in place to ensure equitable distribution of health \\nworkers involved in eye care in all geographic areas. \\nit is important to note that providing equal rates of eye care services \\nbetween population subgroups does not guarantee the delivery of \\nequitable services. for example, in many of the world™s regions, \\ncataract is notably a more common cause of vision impairment and \\nblindness in women than in men \\n(15)\\n. therefore, as women™s needs for \\ncataract surgery are greater, an equal number of operations for \\nwomen and men would not achieve equity. \\nmost eye care delivery focuses on the provision of curative interventions \\nat the secondary and tertiary levels of the health system and is often \\nrestricted to urban and larger regional settings. this adds to inequity in \\naccess to effective interventions for early detection and prevention, and \\ngreater costs for patients (e.g. travel costs). to assist in addressing this \\ninequity between population subgroups, there is a need for \\nimplementation and health systems research to ensure evidence-based \\nplanning of future eye care programmes and services. \\nthere is also evidence demonstrating that eliminating user fees, or \\nreducing out-of-pocket payments at the point of delivery, impacts \\npositively on equitable access to services \\n(77, 78)\\n. however, eye care \\nmedicines and interventions continue to not be integrated into the \\nhealth insurance schemes in many low- and middle-income countries. \\nfor example, fees for cataract surgery and the costs of spectacles and \\ntreatment for noncommunicable eye conditions (e.g. glaucoma, \\ndiabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration) continue to \\nrely on out-of-pocket payments in many settings \\n(79)\\n. even high-income \\ncountries can require out-of-pocket payments for refractive error \\nassessment and correction, or for the purchase of devices, or \\nspecialized insurance for vision care. furthermore, eye care service \\ndelivery is frequently led by charity and nongovernmental organizations \\nthat act independently from the moh.\\nsome low- and middle-income countries (e.g. india, viet nam, rwanda, \\nphilippines, india) have already included cataract surgery and \\ntreatment of other eye conditions in their social health insurance \\n85schemes \\n(box 4.2).\\n however, given substantial increases in cataract \\nsurgical rates, and the associated costs to the health insurance \\nproviders, some countries have introduced limits on the total number of \\nsurgical procedures claimable per accredited surgeon \\n(box 4.3).\\n this \\ncan be detrimental to improving cataract surgical coverage and \\nemphasizes the importance of a thorough planning process that takes \\ninto consideration population needs, projections and workforce \\navailability to estimate the cost and cost coverage.\\n86box 4.2 the inclusion of eye care interventions in health insurance \\nschemes in india: the national programme for control of \\nblindness (npcb) \\nbrief history\\nin 1976, india launched its national programme for prevention of visual \\nimpairment and control of blindness, currently known as the national \\nprogramme for control of blindness (npcb), with an ambitious goal of \\nreducing the prevalence of blindness from 1.4% to 0.3% by the year 2020. \\nsubsequently, a population-based survey conducted in 1986-89 reported a \\nmodest increase in prevalence of blindness to 1.49%, with cataract \\naccounting for 80% of blindness cases. on this basis, the government of \\nindia embarked on the world bank assisted cataract blindness elimination \\nprogramme targeting seven states (andhra pradesh, madhya pradesh, \\nmaharashtra, odisha, rajasthan, tamil nadu and uttar pradesh) where \\nthere was a known high prevalence of cataract blindness. this project was \\nhighly successful in improving cataract surgery rates (from 1342 per million in \\n1995 to 3620 per million in 2002) and rates of intraocular lens implantation \\n(increasing from 3% in 1993 to 75% in 2002). \\nin an effort to decentralize the npcb, the district blindness control society \\n(dbcs) was formed in each district of india in 1994-95. subsequent to this \\n(commencing in 2002), the npcb programme moved to being completely \\nfunded by the government of india without depending on support from \\nexternal funding agencies. under this programme, cataract surgery with \\nintraocular implantation is provided free of charge for approximately one \\nthird of all cataract surgeries, including all surgeries performed on patients \\nwith a poverty certi˜cate. while the initial focus of the programme was on \\nincreasing access to cataract surgery with intraocular implantations, funding \\nsupport was extended in successive years to include a comprehensive \\ncoverage of a range of eye care interventions including laser treatment for \\ndiabetic retinopathy, glaucoma surgeries, preventions and treatment of \\nocular trauma, childhood blindness, keratoplasty, squint, vision rehabilitation \\nand screening and lasers for retinopathy of prematurity through successful \\npublicœprivate partnerships. the dbcs reviews the data submitted by the \\nparticipating hospitals and makes site visits for quality control.\\nprogress\\nin 2016-17, the npcb provided cataract surgery to a total 6.5 million people in \\nindia, achieving a cataract surgical rate of over 6000 per million population. \\nduring this period, school screening was provided to nearly 32 million \\nchildren and approximately 750 000 spectacles were distributed. in addition, \\na total of 1.5 million management/treatment procedures were performed for \\nother eye conditions. as a result of these concerted efforts, an overall \\nreduction in prevalence of blindness was reported from 1.1% in 2001-02 to \\n0.45% during the years 2015œ18.\\n87box 4.3 cataract ˜nancing under national health insurance œ \\nvolume, cost control and equity in the philippines™s philhealth \\nscheme\\nin the philippines, the public health insurance scheme, philhealth, covers \\napproximately 90% of the population and is a major source of funding for \\neye care. cataract surgery is covered in the bene˜t package and has long \\nbeen one of the highest claimed procedures. \\nproviders are paid a ˜xed case payment per eye that is the same regardless of \\nthe method of cataract extraction (i.e. manual small-incision cataract surgery \\nor phacoemulsi˜cation), the type of intraocular lens used (provided it is on the \\nphilippine food and drug administration approved list) and whether the \\nprovider is public or private. for senior citizens, the poor and other philhealth \\nmembers whose premiums are sponsored by the government, there is no out \\nof pocket cost to the patient for cataract surgery conducted within \\ngovernment facilities. however, for all other people treated in government \\nfacilities, and all of those treated in private facilities, providers can charge \\nabove the ˜xed case payment, with the balance paid by the patient. in the \\nphilippines, 60% of accredited providers are in the private sector. \\nsigni˜cant internal controls are in place for cataract surgery under philhealth \\nincluding pre-authorization requirements, such as veri˜able patient \\ninformation and surgery approval by ophthalmology unit heads. in 2015, the \\ncontrol systems identi˜ed unusually high numbers of cataract surgeries \\nbeing sought for reimbursement. this was driven by some providers seeking \\nto pro˜t from the scheme by providing cataract surgeries that may not have \\nbeen necessary or that were fraudulent. \\nin response, philhealth restricted the number of cataract surgical procedures \\nclaimable per accredited surgeon to 50 per month (not exceeding 10 in any \\none day), with the exception being when surgery was undertaken as part of \\na recognized residency training programme. this has resulted in \\nsubstantially reduced claims for cataract surgery œ phacoemulsi˜cation \\nsurgery, for example, was the 5th highest claimed procedure in 2015 (just \\nover 146 000 claims totalling php 2.34 billion) but dropped to 10th position in \\n2016 (just under 95 000 claims totalling php 1.52 billion). the impact of these \\nmeasures on the provision of equitable access to cataract surgery needs to \\nbe investigated.\\n88although the

care.\\nhealth information systems\\nhealth information systems (his) are used to collect, standardize, code \\nand manage information relevant to indicators of health status \\n(including eye conditions and vision impairment); determinants of \\nhealth (including determinants of eye conditions); and health systems \\n(governance and leadership, workforce, essential medicines, \\ntechnologies and assistive products and service delivery). such \\ninformation is needed by (i) policy-makers to identify and respond to \\nproblems with evidence-based solutions, and to allocate resources \\neffectively; (ii) planners to design more effective services, and managers \\nto monitor and evaluate these services; and (iii) clinicians to provide \\nhigh quality and evidence-based care \\n(88)\\n. thus, his underpin health \\nand health-related decision-making in health policy, management and \\nclinical care.\\neven countries with developed his often do not include relevant data on \\neye conditions and vision impairment, their determinants, and health \\nsystems data related to eye care. consequently, decision-makers at all \\nlevels of the health system may lack the information they need to \\nidentify problems and needs, to allocate resources optimally or to \\nprovide evidence-based services. this can result in a signi˜cant gap \\nbetween what policy-makers, health workers and researchers know \\nand what they need to know to improve the health of the population \\n(89)\\n. furthermore, the situation in eye care is further challenged through \\nthe existence of a strong private eye care sector with parallel \\ninformation systems that do not communicate with public sector \\ninformation systems. \\nit is promising that a recent study evaluating 28 national eye care plans \\nfrom low- and middle-income countries found that almost all countries \\nrecognized the need to strengthen their his to support the monitoring \\nof eye care services and policy \\n(76)\\n. in addition, recent advocacy efforts \\nhave also focused on expanding eye care indicators within primary \\ncare \\n(90)\\n. however, much needs to be done; addressing the challenge \\nof strengthening his to include information relevant to eye care is of the \\noutmost importance in the coming years. \\n91the way forward\\nthe challenges ahead are considerable but can be addressed, \\nespecially because the ˜eld of eye care can build on its many successes. \\nfirst, effective interventions are available to reduce the risk of acquiring \\nan eye condition or vision impairment and of mitigating the impact. \\nsecondly, as demonstrated through vision 2020, eye care can rely on a \\nlong tradition of effective and coordinated advocacy that progresses \\ntowards common goals. thirdly, a number of scienti˜c and technological \\nadvances have been made with the potential to facilitate early \\ndiagnoses and accelerate the response.\\nin addition, there are also windows of opportunity to facilitate progress, \\nthe most relevant being the sustainable development goals (sdgs). eye \\ncare services are particularly relevant to achieving sdg3: ﬁensure \\nhealthy lives and promote well-being for all at all agesﬂ, particularly \\nsdg target 3.8 on uhc: ﬁachieve uhc, including ˜nancial risk \\nprotection, access to quality essential health-care services and access \\nto safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and \\nvaccines for allﬂ. eye care services also contribute to other targets, such \\nas those on neglected tropical disease (target 3.3), mental health \\n(target 3.4), road traf˜c accidents (target 3.6), and workforce health \\n(target 3c). \\nbuilding on successes, considering the political commitment towards \\nachieving sdg3, and moving forward with uhc, \\nchapters 5\\n and 6\\n describe uhc and ipec and how each can help address the current \\nand future challenges identi˜ed in this chapter. \\nchapter 5\\n introduces \\nuhc and its contribution to achieving better integration of eye care into \\nhealth systems and to reducing inequalities by planning and providing \\nquality eye services according to population needs. \\nchapter 6\\n presents \\nipec through health system strengthening to address these challenges, \\nparticularly those related to the eye care workforce, and the \\ncoordination

objective towards which \\nhealth systems should strive. uhc means that all people have access to \\nthe health services they need, when and where they need them, without \\n˜nancial hardship. it includes the full range of essential health services, \\nfrom health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and \\npalliative care \\n(1)\\n. additionally, uhc is a powerful approach to ensure \\nprogress in meeting other health-related sdg3 targets.\\ndebates and actions around the implementation of uhc take into \\nconsideration the following issues:\\n     ensuring coverage of the population œ i.e. leaving no one behind;\\n     ensuring ˜nancial health protection and avoiding catastrophic \\nexpenditures;\\n     providing a package of high-quality integrated and people-centred \\nhealth services.\\nit is important to note that each country may have different starting \\npoints and pathways as they progress towards uhc; these will depend \\nupon population needs, available resources, the political and social \\ncontext, and the maturity of the health system, among other factors. \\nhowever, to attain the overarching goal of uhc a health system \\napproach is required\\n, whereby all health system components are \\nstrengthened to provide comprehensive, quality services. furthermore, \\nthe health sector needs to collaborate actively with other relevant \\nsectors and stakeholders to discuss and agree on potential strategies to \\nimprove the population™s health. \\nto address many of the challenges identi˜ed in chapter 4 œ particularly \\nthose relating to changing demographics, inequities in access, and lack \\nof integration œ eye care needs to be an integral part of uhc. however, \\nsigni˜cant work needs to be done given that priority eye

suggest the following messages for \\npolicy makers:\\n100(i)\\n  \\nprovide quality eye care services according to population needs to \\nimprove service coverage and reduce inequalities. this requires \\nassessments of total population eye care needs (i.e. both met and \\nunmet needs);\\n(ii)\\n  \\nensure that the cost of priority eye care interventions are included in \\nservice packages covered by pre-paid pooled ˜nancing;\\n(iii)\\n move towards ipec.\\nthe ˜rst two points are addressed in this chapter; the third, on ipec and \\nits role in eye care, is introduced in \\nchapter

\\npopulation needs \\nhighlighting the importance of quality care is not new in the ˜eld of eye \\ncare; the quality of cataract surgery, for example, has at times been a \\nconcern. thus, in recent years, greater emphasis has been placed on \\nreporting the population-based measure of effective coverage of \\ncataract surgery \\n(see chapter 4, box 4.1)\\n in order to understand both \\nthe accessibility and quality of cataract surgery within populations \\n(2, \\n3). additionally, in the clinical context, there have been successful \\nexamples where the introduction of innovative tools to monitor the \\nquality of cataract surgery has resulted in improved safety and \\noutcomes \\n(box 5.1).\\nbox 5.1 monitoring the quality and safety of cataract surgery: a \\ncase example from malaysia\\nthe outcome of cataract surgery is dependent on surgeon skill and therefore \\nmonitoring competency is important to ensure patient safety and standard \\nof care. in 2009, an innovative quality monitoring tool, the cumulative sum \\n(cusum) analysis, was implemented in the ophthalmology programme in \\n the moh of malaysia. the cusum is a statistical process control tool that \\nobjectively assesses that outcome of consecutive cataract surgery \\nperformances over time with reference to predetermined outcome standards.\\nto date, cusum has been applied to close to 1300 ophthalmic trainees and \\nconsultants in all hospitals in the moh of malaysia (estimated to provide \\n50-70% of all cataract surgeries in the country) for the occurrence of posterior \\ncapsular rupture and a post-operative best-corrected visual acuity of worse \\nthan 6/18. if trainees cusum charts display an unacceptable level of \\nperformance, their supervisors provide feedback and impose closer \\nmonitoring of subsequent surgeries.\\nevidence of impact of this strategy is available. between 2007 and 2017, the \\nrate of posterior capsular rupture reduced from 4.2% to 2.4%. during a similar \\nperiod, a modest improvement in the proportion of patients who had a \\npost-operative visual acuity outcome of 6/18 or better was also observed \\n(96.1% (2007) vs. 97% (2016)).\\nas demonstrated in \\nbox 5.2\\n, many different characteristics need to be \\ntaken into consideration to provide high-quality health services. this will \\nrequire a more deliberate focus on the quality of eye care services from \\npolicy makers in countries. high-quality health services are now \\ngenerally understood to involve the right care, at the right time, \\nresponding to the service users™ needs and preferences, while \\nminimizing harm and resource waste. the measurable characteristics \\nessential to quality health-care services include being effective, safe, \\n102and people-centred; to realize the bene˜ts, they should also be timely, \\nequitable, integrated and ef˜cient \\n(fig. 5.1)\\n (4)\\n. an example of how these \\ncharacteristics can be applied to eye care services for an individual is \\npresented in \\nbox 5.2\\n. an assessment of the state of the quality of health care requires \\nconsensus on the de˜nition and measurement of indicators for quality \\nat a national level, and needs to be comparable across countries. \\ntherefore, for the eye care sector to move forward, output and \\noutcome indicators need to be de˜ned. in addition, structural measures \\nof quality of eye care for service delivery (inputs), including equipment, \\nhuman resources, incentives and organizational characteristics, will be \\nrequired \\n(see chapter 6, fig. 6.2)\\n.figure 5.1 elements of health-care quality in the context of eye care \\n(5)\\n˜˚˚˛˝˙ˆˇ\\n˜\\n\\n103box 5.2 example of how the elements of health-care quality can \\nbe applied to eye care services for an individual\\nconsider julie, a woman in her sixties who lives with her husband in a rural \\nlocation. she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 2.5 years ago and \\nhas since attended regular diabetes check-ups at the primary care centre. \\nher blood sugar levels are currently well controlled with medication. during \\nthe past few months, julie has noticed a gradual reduction in her vision; \\nhowever she attributes this to ﬁnormalﬂ changes associated with ageing. \\ntoday, she presents to the primary care centre for the routine assessment of \\nher diabetes. her vision is also checked, and it is noted that julie has reduced \\nvisual acuity in both eyes; her right eye being worse than her left. she is \\nimmediately referred to the local eye care provider where she is diagnosed \\noperable cataracts. a thorough retinal examination does not reveal signs of \\nsight-threatening diabetic retinopathy.\\nthe following points illustrate the high-quality care that julie would receive \\nwithin the framework of the seven key elements of quality.\\n šhigh-quality care for julie is people-centred:\\n the care julie receives \\nwould respect her preferences, needs and values. julie may \\nunderstandably be worried and ask many questions. the health-care \\nworkers attending her would listen to her questions and concerns, answer \\npatiently, and provide both oral and written information about all aspects \\nof treatment tailored to her needs. the health-care services would be \\nlocated near to where julie lives, and she should only be required to travel \\na further distance for her cataract surgery.\\n šhigh-quality care for julie is equitable:\\n the services received by julie, \\nincluding the timing of services, would not vary according to her personal \\ndemographics (e.g. gender, race), the geographical location in which she \\nresides, or her socioeconomic status. \\n šhigh-quality care for julie is effective:\\n the care julie receives would be \\nbased on scienti˜c knowledge and evidence-based guidelines \\n(6)\\n. julie \\nwould be reassured that she would receive evidence-based care and that \\na systematic process would be followed. she would be informed that her \\ncataract surgery should be successful in achieving the desired visual \\noutcome, and that any residual post-operative refractive error or other \\ncomplications that may impact on vision (i.e. posterior capsular opacity) \\nwould be addressed in a timely manner.\\n šhigh-quality care for julie is safe:\\n the care julie receives would minimize \\nharm, including preventable surgical complications and medical errors \\n(e.g. wrong lens implant). clear guidelines to prevent infections (e.g. \\nendophthalmitis) and medical errors would be in place in the health \\nfacility. a thorough review of her medications and allergies would be \\nmade, and clear instructions would be given as to how to care for her eye \\nafter cataract surgery and when to return for post-operative assessment. \\nin order to minimize the potential for non-attendance at postoperative \\nand subsequent follow-up visits, a speci˜c, identi˜able point of contact \\nmay be assigned to julie. full consideration would be given to the \\nprevention and management of any potential increased risks of surgery \\nrelated to her diabetes (i.e. post-operative macular oedema); julie would \\nundergo detailed retinal examination post-operatively to check for signs of \\n104progression of diabetic retinopathy and, if necessary, treatment would be \\nbased on clinical guidelines \\n(7)\\n. šhigh-quality care for julie is timely:\\n julie™s care would keep to a \\nminimum any delays in the provision of services. timely cataract surgery \\nwould be important to allow julie to function effectively and to maintain \\nadherence to her prescribed diabetic medication regimen. additionally, it \\nwould be important for surgery to be undertaken before the lens opacities \\nobscure the view of her retina, thereby prohibiting assessment of diabetic \\nretinopathy. with proper planning, julie would not have to experience long \\nwaiting times during post-operative follow-up visits. contact with other \\nhealth providers involved in her care, such as those required for routine \\ndiabetic retinopathy examinations, would be managed by an ef˜cient \\npatient ˛ow system for scheduling or modifying visits and for notifying \\npatients of projected waiting times. \\n šhigh-quality care for julie is integrated:\\n the care julie receives across \\nfacilities and providers would be coordinated. following cataract surgery, \\nshe would continue her regular diabetes check-ups at the primary care \\ncentre so that her diabetes could be managed. arrangements would be \\nmade for her to undergo regular monitoring of her retina to check for signs \\nof diabetic retinopathy progression; the timing of this would be based on \\nclinical guidelines \\n(7)\\n. a social worker would be available to help connect \\nher with the required services.\\n šhigh-quality care for julie is ef˜cient;\\n the care julie receives would avoid \\na waste of resources. in order to prevent repetition and waste of resources, \\neach of her health providers would be able to track the results of her \\nprevious examinations and procedures via an electronic medical record \\nsystem. her care would be provided by a cohesive team, with each \\nmember working on tasks that match their competencies.\\nbeyond understanding and monitoring quality, data on population \\nneeds for eye care are essential for planning eye care services as part of \\nuhc. these data can best be derived from population-based surveys. \\nas discussed in \\nchapter 6\\n, to strengthen data collection, these surveys \\nneed to be an integral part of his. \\nas outlined in \\nchapter 4\\n, population-based surveys not only need to \\nprovide information on both met and

\\nbox 5.4\\n.106community consultations also provide an important source of \\ninformation on the eye care needs of populations \\n(1)\\n. consultations are \\na concrete way in which the public can be engaged in the development \\nof national health plans that, ultimately, affect them, and where they \\ncan provide feedback. these consultations improve accountability and \\ntransparency and increase the sense of ownership and engagement of \\nthe population œ especially marginalized groups œ transforming them \\ninto active stakeholders. this is particularly relevant to eye care, given \\nthat some marginalized groups are unequally impacted by eye \\nconditions and vision impairment, and also because eye conditions, in \\ngeneral, are common and have a well-demonstrated impact on \\nindividuals over their life course.\\nbox 5.3 reducing gender disparities in service uptake by pastoral \\ncommunities in kenya\\nthe coordinated approach to community health (catch)\\n2 project builds on \\ntrachoma initiatives to ensure that eye conditions, including cataracts and \\nrefractive error, could be diagnosed at trachoma screening clinics, and \\npatients referred and treated. in kenya, the project predominantly targets \\npoor and marginalized pastoral communities in arid and semi-arid areas. \\nin these communities, women often experience additional cultural barriers in \\naccessing health services. to address this, catch employs strategies to \\ntarget women, including training female community health workers (chws) \\nto mobilize women to attend eye camps, and to engage women who have \\nsuccessfully undergone eye surgery as ﬁambassadors of hopeﬂ. women are \\ntargeted at strategic locations (e.g. maternal health clinics), and eye \\nscreening is carried out at common meeting areas such as water points and \\nmarkets. direct targeting also involves door-to-door screening.\\nby taking services out to remote areas with no health facilities, catch \\nenables those women seeking care to remain in their environment, thus \\ncausing less interference to their daily responsibilities. where services are \\navailable in a static health facility only, catch provides transport to facilitate \\nlogistics and reduce costs.\\ncatch kenya achieved a high level of participation of women from the \\nbeginning of the project. in the ˜rst year, 54.3% of people screened at the \\ncatch camp were women; this had risen to 58.7% in the third year. the \\npercentage of women receiving surgery for cataracts followed a similar \\ntrend. the exception was in the provision of spectacles for reading, where \\nthe number of men was consistently higher. some women perceived \\nspectacles to be for reading only, and as most could not read, had minimal \\nneed for these. the demand for spectacles by women increased, possibly \\nbecause women realized their use for seeing near objects and working with \\nhandicrafts. by the third year, half of the spectacles distributed in catch \\ncamps were to women, which was an encouraging development.\\n2 district comprehensive eye care (dcec) project is funded by seeing is believing, \\nstandard chartered bank™s global community investment programme. \\n107box 5.4 gender disparities in uptake of cataract surgical services \\nin khyber pakhtunkhwa province, pakistan\\nin pakistan, cataracts are the major cause of blindness, despite being \\ntreatable with a straightforward and cost-effective surgery. a rapid \\nassessment of avoidable blindness (raab) survey undertaken in the khyber \\npakhtunkhwa province\\n3, revealed that prevalence of blindness caused by \\nun-operated cataract was 6.5% in women above 50 years of age, compared \\nto 2% in men; and the cataract surgical coverage for women was \\nconsiderably lower than for men (75% versus 94%).\\nto explore the reasons for the lower uptake of cataract surgeries by women, \\nfocus group discussions were held with female health workers and \\nbene˜ciaries. these identi˜ed cost and logistics of travel as major barriers to \\naccessing services. many women did not have access to family ˜nances to \\npay for surgery and travel costs. women also had less access to information \\nabout treatments, due to lower literacy rates, and many saw cataracts as an \\ninevitable consequence of ageing. \\nstrategies were introduced to target women and make services in khyber \\npakhtunkhwa more gender-sensitive. partnering hospitals have introduced \\ngender-focused patient satisfaction surveys, and the number of female eye \\ncare workers will be increased. to strengthen the referral chain, more female \\nhealth staff and paramedics will be trained to screen and refer women to \\nhospitals, and female mid-level eye care staff will be trained in partnership \\nwith the pakistan government. awareness and information about free \\ncataract surgeries will be spread to better target female audiences including \\npartnerships with women™s organisations and audio and video messages on \\nmedia networks. \\npreliminary data shows encouraging trends and it is expected that these \\nstrategies will progressively increase the proportion of women accessing \\ncataract services over the three years of the project. the output targets have \\nbeen discussed with implementing partners and will be closely monitored. \\n3 sightsavers™ district comprehensive eye care (dcec) project is funded by seeing \\nis believing, standard chartered bank™s global community investment \\nprogramme.\\n108ensuring that costs are not a \\n barrier to eye care\\nprotection against ˜nancial hardship means ensuring that the cost of \\neye care does not expose the user to catastrophic expenses. \\nas outlined in \\nchapter 2\\n, the costs of attending eye care services pose a \\nsigni˜cant barrier to access and can severely limit the well-being and \\nlife opportunities for individuals, and their families. an important \\ncomponent of uhc for eye care, therefore, is that all people obtain the \\neye care services they need without risking ˜nancial hardship from \\nunaffordable out-of-pocket payments \\n(8). in general, and as suggested by the 2014 report of the who \\nconsultative group on equity and uhc \\n(9)\\n, to achieve uhc, countries \\nneed to advance in three dimensions \\n(fig.˚5.2)\\n. first, priority services \\nneed to be expanded; secondly, more people need to be covered; and \\nthirdly, out-of-pocket payments need to be reduced \\n(1)\\n. in addressing \\nthese dimensions, countries need to make important choices including: \\nwhich services should be covered ˜rst; who should be prioritized; and \\nhow can out-of-pocket payments be shifted towards prepayment. for \\nexample, should interventions, such as the provision of spectacles, be \\nprioritized over interventions needed for a smaller proportion of the \\npopulation, such as trachoma? should interventions for eye conditions \\nthat affect children be prioritized and included early on in the package, \\nor should they be postponed for a later stage when more resources will \\nbe available? is it possible to effectively work with ngos for a limited \\nperiod of time in order to increase the volume of certain interventions, \\nsuch as cataract surgery? \\n109figure 5.2 dimensions of universal health coverage\\n (1)\\nwhen selecting services, it is useful to adopt three categories of priority: \\nhigh, medium, and low. classi˜cation of services into these three \\ncategories should be based on locally determined criteria, which may \\ninclude cost-effectiveness, priority to those who are ˜nancially worse off \\n(equity), and ˜nancial risk protection. when deciding on which services \\nto expand, a useful starting point is, again, cost-effectiveness estimates, \\nintegrating these with concern for the ˜nancially worse off, and other \\ncriteria, such as safety, and health system capacity. the speci˜cation \\nand balancing of these criteria need to be guided by robust public \\ndeliberation and participatory procedures. \\nthe eye care sector is well positioned to engage in an evidence-based \\ndialogue given that many eye care interventions are highly cost-\\neffective and feasible to implement \\n(10-13)\\n. when deciding on extending \\npopulation coverage for a given set of services, low-income groups, \\nrural populations, and other disadvantaged (in terms of services or \\nhealth) groups should be prioritized. \\nhealth care is funded by a range of sources, including government \\nbudgets, social health insurance agencies, and households. while the \\nmedian out-of-pocket spending on health represents less than 20% of \\n110a package of eye \\ncare interventions \\nis needed to \\nfacilitate the \\nintegration of eye \\ncare into the \\nhealth sector and \\nuhc to effectively \\nmeet population \\nneeds.total health spending in high-income countries, it accounts for more \\nthan 40% in low-income countries \\n(14)\\n. out-of-pocket spending is a \\nbarrier to accessing health services, especially for those who are poor, \\nand can be a substantial ˜nancial burden on those who use the \\nservices and their families. out-of-pocket payments for health services \\npush 100 million people into extreme poverty every year \\n(14)\\n. to improve \\naccess with ˜nancial risk protection, countries should therefore shift \\nfrom out-of-pocket payments towards mandatory prepayments with \\npooling of funds. while this may be dif˜cult for some countries, \\nprecedence should always be given to high-priority services and \\ndisadvantaged groups, including those who are poor. in the case of \\ninsurance and other mandatory arrangements for prepayments, \\ncountries should ensure that the inability to pay is not a barrier to \\ncoverage.\\n4 to facilitate the choices that countries must make when implementing \\nuhc, who is developing an online data repository detailing who-\\nrecommended interventions and their resource implications. the \\nrepository is intended as a global resource to facilitate discussions at \\ncountry level around what services to provide within health bene˜t \\npackages. the database will contain information on service delivery \\nimplications, health workforce requirements, essential medicines and \\ndevices, with links to overall who recommendations and guidelines. \\nthe global database will be accompanied by extensive guidance on \\nhow to carry out a country local contextualization processes to drive \\ncountry impact, building on existing who tools œ such as the who \\nonehealth tool \\n(box 5.5)\\n œ and further expanding existing guidance. \\nthe repository will include information on a recommended package of \\neye care interventions \\n(box 5.6)\\n. the enhanced access to evidence and \\nrecommendations, and the accompanying country level tools, will \\nsupport moh in planning, budgeting, and integrating eye care \\ninterventions to their national health services packages and policies, \\naccording to population needs and available resources, and thus, \\nultimately contribute to moving forward the agenda of eye care as part \\nof uhc. \\n111box 5.5 the onehealth tool \\nthe onehealth tool is a software tool designed to inform national strategic \\nhealth planning and costing in low- and middle-income countries. \\nthe onehealth tool considers the demands on the health system, whether \\nfrom a health-system-wide perspective or a programme-speci˜c perspective. \\nit provides a single framework for planning, costing, impact analysis, \\nbudgeting and ˜nancing of strategies for all major diseases and health \\nsystem components. the tool is prepopulated with defaults for disease \\nprevalence and incidence; interven\\n \\ntion protocols for promotive, preventive \\nand curative care; and prices of drugs, supplies and equipment œ all of which \\ncan be changed by the user. \\noutputs from an application can help planners answer the following \\nquestions:\\n šwhat would be the health system resources needed to implement the \\nstrategic health plan?\\n šhow much would the strategic plan cost, by year and by input?\\n šwhat is the estimated health impact?\\n šhow do costs compare with estimated available ˜nancing?\\nthe tool is designed for use by experts involved in national health planning, \\nincluding government health sector planners, disease-speci˜c programme \\nplanners, ngos, donors, un agencies, researchers and consultants. since its \\nrelease in 2012, the onehealth tool has been applied in more than 40 \\ncountries.\\ninterventions for eye care will be added to the onehealth tool in 2020.\\n112box 5.6 development process of the package of eye care \\ninterventions\\nwho is developing a package of eye care interventions to facilitate the \\nintegration of eye care into the health sector and into uhc. the package will \\nprovide a set of evidenced-based and cost-effective interventions including \\nthe resource requirements for those interventions such as assistive products, \\nequipment, medicines, consumables and workforce competencies. \\nthe process of developing the package starts with selecting a range of \\npriority eye conditions based on global epidemiological data and proposals \\nfrom experts in the ˜eld. for example, if glaucoma is one of the conditions \\nselected, working groups, comprising clinical and academic experts in the \\n˜eld, will then identify evidence-based interventions for glaucoma by drawing \\non a range of sources including high-quality clinical practice guidelines and \\nsystematic reviews. following this, a professional working group from each \\nworld region will engage in a three-step process towards developing a list of \\ninterventions for glaucoma. once the list has been con˜rmed, working group \\nmembers will agree on the appropriate service delivery platform for each \\nintervention (i.e. primary, secondary of tertiary). finally, the resources required \\nfor each intervention will be de˜ned and the ˜nal package will undergo a \\nthorough peer review process.\\n ˜˚\\n\\nˇ˘˛\\n\\n˚\\n\\n\\n\\n˚˙˘˛\\nš˛ˇ\\n˛˝\\n\\n\\nˇ\\n˛\\n†ˇ\\n\\n\\n\\n“‘ˇ˘˛\\n’\\n\\nadapted from:\\n rauch a,

2019.\\n113some countries, such as cambodia, kenya, mali and morocco, have \\nrecently taken signi˜cant steps towards implementing uhc, including \\neye care, despite signi˜cant resource constraints. for example, \\ncambodia has already established their priority eye care interventions \\nwithin the context of their essential package of health services \\n(box 5.7). \\ndespite this, it remains that a considerable number of countries globally \\ndo not include eye care services as part of uhc œ of 29 countries (59% \\nlow-income or low- to middle-income) that completed the who ecsat \\nbetween 2014 and 2016, more than 20% reported that health insurance \\nschemes did not cover any eye care services; several other countries \\nreported that eye care services were only minimally covered. \\nbox 5.7 the inclusion of eye care in health sector strategic plans: a \\ncase study from cambodia\\nin cambodia, the moh has adopted a robust process to inform eye care \\nservice planning. since 2008, eye care has been routinely included as a \\npriority in the cambodian national health strategic plans. in 2015, the moh \\ncommenced development of the current health plan (2016œ2020). the \\nplanning process included projecting the estimated costs of activities and \\ntargets within the strategic plan, in order to inform priority setting and \\nresource mobilisation. as part of this activity, costs associated with providing \\neye care services were estimated.\\nthis process required de˜ning the resources, or inputs, associated with eye \\ncare, estimating the average cost for priority interventions, and projecting \\nthe total number of these priority interventions that needed to be provided \\neach year, as well as the costs associated with running the overall \\nprogramme, including activities such as monitoring and evaluation. this \\nprocess enabled the moh to assess the resources needed to meet national \\ntargets for eye care which informed the development of the national eye \\ncare plan (national strategic plan for blindness prevention and control \\n2016œ2020). \\nthe national plan includes comprehensive objectives that cover many \\naspects of strengthening health systems, such as workforce requirements. it \\nalso provides a high degree of detail, specifying activities, outputs, time \\nframes, responsible agencies, targets, indicators and associated costs.\\nin summary, the provision of good quality eye care, in accordance with \\npopulation needs, reduces health inequalities; however, reliable \\ninformation about population needs are essential. uhc requires that \\neach country expands priority eye care services; that more people are \\ncovered; and that the costs of eye care will not expose individuals to \\ncatastrophic out-of-pocket expenses. who is currently developing a \\npackage of eye care interventions that, in combination with other tools \\nœ in particular, the onehealth tool œ will support

life course.\\nthe implementation of integrated people-\\ncentred eye care requires four strategies:\\n1.\\n empowering and engaging people and \\ncommunities; \\n2. reorienting the model of care; \\n3. coordinating services within and across \\nsectors; and \\n4. creating an enabling environment\\n117achieving ipec \\nrequires four \\nstrategies\\nintegrated people-centred eye care \\nbuilding on who™s existing framework on integrated people-centred \\nhealth services \\n(1)\\n, ipec is de˜ned as services that are managed and \\ndelivered so that people receive a continuum of health interventions \\ncovering promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, to \\naddress the full spectrum of eye conditions according to their needs, \\ncoordinated across the different levels and sites of care within and \\nbeyond the health sector, and that recognizes people as participants \\nand bene˜ciaries of these services, throughout their life course.\\nwho™s commitment to the framework on integrated people-centred \\nhealth services has been adapted to eye care because, as described in \\nchapter 4\\n, the challenges facing health services that motivated their \\ndevelopment, are characteristic of the eye care sector: eye care services \\nare inequitably distributed, of unequal quality and poorly integrated \\nacross related health programmes and sectors; and these services are \\noften provided by an uncoordinated and, at times, unregulated \\nworkforce. furthermore, there is a lack of integration of eye care related \\ninformation in his. ipec has the potential to overcome these challenges \\nand to facilitate approaches to service delivery that respond to \\nemerging health challenges in the eye care sector, including unhealthy \\nlifestyles, ageing populations, and the need to address a range of \\nnoncommunicable eye conditions. \\nachieving ipec by adapting the framework of integrated people-\\ncentred health services to eye care, requires the following four \\nstrategies:\\n1.\\n empowering and engaging people and communities; \\n2.\\n reorienting the model of care; \\n3.\\n coordinating services within and across sectors; and \\n4.\\n creating an enabling environment\\nthis chapter provides high-level guidance on these four strategies for \\nthe eye care sector. it is acknowledged that countries may have \\ndifferent starting points when implementing these strategies, \\ndepending on the maturity of their health system, resources available, \\nand local needs.\\n118empowering and engaging people and \\ncommunitiesas identi˜ed in the framework for integrated, people-centred health \\nservices, empowering and engaging individuals, families, communities \\nand care-givers to become effective users of health services requires the \\nprovision of opportunities, skills and resources, and advocating for a \\nreformed health system to enhance health care experience and \\noutcomes. underserved and marginalized populations must be \\nreached in order to guarantee universal access to quality services that \\nare co-produced according to their speci˜c preferences and needs. in \\norder to tailor these requirements to address eye care, countries must \\nbuild targeted policy options and interventions.  \\nhealth literacy is an essential component of empowering individuals \\nand their families; it is crucial for the effectiveness of many eye care \\ninterventions and, more generally, for compliance \\n(2-4)\\n. the vast \\nmajority of cases of vision impairment caused by common eye \\nconditions, such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, are avoidable \\nwith early detection and timely intervention \\n(5-7)\\n. however, a large \\nproportion of individuals remain undiagnosed because these \\nconditions are often asymptomatic in their early stages; awareness of \\nthe importance of regular eye examinations among high-risk \\npopulations (such as the elderly and those with diabetes) is largely \\nlacking. in some situations, inadequate knowledge of the availability of \\nservices, along with a tendency for individuals to consider reduced \\nvision as part of the normal ageing process, can also lead to poor \\noutcomes \\n(8). furthermore, even when individuals are aware having an \\neye condition, poor eye health literacy can limit adherence to \\nmedications and routine assessment \\n(3, 4, 9)\\n. the eye care sector needs to increase its efforts to provide sound, and \\neffective education. strategies for engagement and empowerment can \\noccur at the individual or speci˜c population group level. one of the \\nexamples of effective community empowerment in the ˜eld of eye care \\nis the community-directed treatment with ivermectin as a preventive \\nintervention for onchocerciasis (box 6.1).\\nthe eye care sector \\nneeds to increase \\nits efforts to \\nprovide sound, \\nand effective \\neducation.119outreach eye care \\nservices have been \\nshown effective in \\nincreasing service \\ncoverage in hard-\\nto-reach \\ncommunitiesbox 6.1 community-directed treatment with ivermectin (cdti) for \\nthe prevention of onchocerciasis\\nonchocerciasis is transmitted by black˛ies and can lead to vision \\nimpairment and blindness. ivermectin is an effective and safe medicine for \\nthe mass treatment of onchocerciasis. mobile teams of health workers faced \\na range of challenges with initial methods of ivermectin distribution \\nincluding low coverage, minimal community involvement, and high costs to \\nthe health system. in 1995, the african programme for onchocerciasis control \\n(apoc) was established. apoc™s strategy of community-directed treatment \\nwith ivermectin (cdti) was formally adopted in 1997 after a multicountry \\nstudy demonstrated that community-directed treatment was a feasible, \\neffective and sustainable approach \\n(10)\\n. cdti focuses on empowering communities to take responsibility for \\nivermectin delivery œ i.e. putting the community in charge of deciding how, \\nwhen and by whom ivermectin distribution should take place. this strategy \\nhas resulted in substantial achievements for onchocerciasis control in africa:\\n šover 142 million people received treatment for onchocerciasis by the end of \\n2017. in the same year, fourteen countries reported having achieved 100% \\ngeographical coverage.\\n šover 17 million disability-adjusted life years (dalys) have been averted \\n(11)\\n. šby 2005, the prevalence of infection had declined to about 73% of its level \\nprior to cdti and was estimated to decline to 14% of the pre-cdti level \\n by 2015.\\neye care literacy must target raising awareness of the availability of \\nvision rehabilitation. many individuals with severe vision impairment \\nand blindness that cannot be treated may live in situations of \\ndependency because they or, their family and community, are unaware \\nthat rehabilitation services can be provided to achieve independence. if \\nthese services are unavailable, health literacy can engage people to \\nadvocate for them.\\ninformation technology has introduced new solutions to overcome the \\nchallenge of timely information exchange and health education, the \\neye care sector must take advantage of this technology. for example, \\nroutine mobile text messages have been shown to increase the rate of \\nattendance at eye care facilities \\n(12)\\n. the use of electronic health \\nrecords, and ensuring that patients have easy access to their records, \\nare additional ways of strengthening communication between eye care \\npatients and providers \\n(13-15)\\n.outreach eye care services have been shown effective in increasing \\nservice coverage in hard-to-reach communities, enabling greater \\nresponsiveness to local community needs \\n(16, 17)\\n. when implementing \\neye care programmes, it is important to ensure that they are an integral \\npart of the health sector service delivery system, both for sustainability \\nand because new avenues of delivery of eye care interventions can then \\nbe explored. for example, eye care interventions, such as screening, can \\n120to simplify access \\nto care for \\nunderserved \\npopulations, rapid \\ntechnological \\nchange has \\npotential. \\nbe integrated into the delivery systems of existing health interventions, \\nsuch as for vaccines. \\nto simplify access to care for underserved populations, rapid \\ntechnological change also has potential. as described in \\nchapter 4\\n, telehealth is employed effectively in the ˜eld of eye care. telehealth \\nsupports people in rural and remote settings who are otherwise \\nunderserved \\n(18, 19)\\n, and facilitates care coordination between care \\nproviders \\n(box 6.2)\\n.121box 6.2 engaging rural and remote communities through \\ntelehealth: a case example from lions outback vision, australia\\nteleophthalmology, particularly real-time video consultations, holds great \\npotential to improve the accessibility of services in countries where \\ngeography, population and workforce distribution make it dif˜cult to provide \\nspecialist eye services outside of major cities. ophthalmology is particularly \\nsuited to telemedicine due to its high reliance on imaging for the diagnosis \\nand management of ocular disease.\\noverview of the service\\nsince 2011, lions outback vision (lov) œ part of the lions eye institute œ has \\nprovided a state-wide teleophthalmology service, linking patients in rural \\nand remote communities of western australia to consultant \\nophthalmologists based in the state capital city, perth. the distance from \\nperth to the furthest community in the service is over 3000˚km. referrals to \\nthe service originate from optometrists working within regional communities, \\nwith rural hospital emergency departments and general practitioners often \\nreferring patients for optometric review. the service provides a combination \\nof ﬁstore-and-forwardﬂ and ﬁreal-timeﬂ telemedicine links, with results of \\nophthalmic investigations being sent to the treating ophthalmologist prior to \\na real-time video consultation. patients who require ophthalmological \\nclinical assessment or surgical management are provided with an \\nappointment at an upcoming lov outreach visit.\\nfollowing advocacy and a demonstrated evidence base, government health \\ninsurance rebates were introduced for optometrists and general \\npractitioners to support telehealth in 2015. there are minimal additional \\ninfrastructure costs, given that ubiquitous platforms such as skype or \\nfacetime are used for video-consultations. currently, 94% of all optometrists \\nin the regions visited by lov actively participate in the telehealth service. the \\nprovision of both an online booking system and availability for ﬁon callﬂ \\nurgent assessment reduces barriers for uptake.\\nkey outcomes\\nfollowing implementation of the lov telehealth service, the non-attendance \\nrate at outreach service visits has decreased from approximately 50% to 3%. \\npatients also demonstrated very high satisfaction with the telehealth service.  \\nthe provision of video consultations that include patient consent, and \\nbooking, for surgery has resulted in several key outcomes. firstly, it has \\neliminated the ﬁwait for the waiting listﬂ, where patients can wait for up to \\none year for a public service outpatient appointment prior to being placed \\non the waiting list for surgery. in addition, the ef˜ciency and impact of \\noutreach ophthalmology services has improved signi˜cantly œ a higher \\nproportion of primary eye care is being appropriately managed by \\noptometry with less duplication of services, and a marked increase in \\nsurgical management by lov ophthalmologists.\\n122reorienting the model of care\\nreorienting the model of care involves ensuring that ef˜cient and \\neffective health-care services are designed and provided by means of \\ninnovative models of care that prioritize primary and community care \\nservices and the co-production of health. the framework on integrated \\npeople-centred health services de˜nes service priorities based on \\nlife-course needs, and building a strong phc. strong phc, with \\nintegrated eye care, is important since eye care involves both the \\ndelivery of interventions aimed at the individual through primary care \\n(e.g. diabetic retinopathy screening) and population-based \\ninterventions, such as the provision of vitamin a supplementation. \\nduring this century, building or strengthening phc, and integrating eye \\ncare, is vital for a number of reasons. first, phc makes it possible for \\nhealth systems to adapt and respond to changing population \\ndemographics and lifestyle changes and the increasing number of \\npeople with eye conditions and vision impairment. secondly, phc \\npromotes access to services across the continuum of care, while \\nfacilitating the use of health promotive and preventive services that are \\noften more cost-effective than treatment services. finally, phc is critical \\nto sustainably addressing other key components of uhc such as (i) \\nreducing household expenditure by emphasizing population-level \\nservices that prevent eye conditions and promote early detection and \\ntimely referral; and (ii) reaching remote and disadvantaged populations \\nthrough a focus on community-based services that are provided as \\nclose as feasible to people™s homes \\n(20)\\n. strengthening eye care in phc requires adequate funding, appropriate \\nworkforce training, a sustainable workforce \\n(20)\\n, coordination with \\nother services and sectors, and effectively-planned referral systems. \\nwhen suf˜ciently resourced, phc can meet a large number of people™s \\neye care needs throughout their life course, and can raise awareness of \\nthe importance of maintaining eye health and eye disease prevention \\nbehaviours, such as facial cleanliness to prevent active trachoma. \\nservices for diabetic retinopathy \\n(21)\\n; refractive services for adults; \\ncase-˜nding of common eye conditions, such as cataract; and the \\ndiagnosis and management of some common eye conditions that do \\nnot typically cause vision impairment, such as conjunctivitis, can also be \\nprovided within phc. in situations where more specialized services are \\nrequired œ for example after the detection of cataracts or diabetic \\nretinopathy œ primary care can facilitate referrals and coordination \\nacross providers and care settings. given that many of the eye \\nconditions that can be effectively managed at the primary care level \\nare often conditions for which people seek eye care in secondary and \\nstrengthening \\n eye care in \\n phc requires \\nadequate funding, \\nappropriate \\nworkforce training, \\na sustainable \\nworkforce.\\n123there is no single \\npath countries can \\nfollow to achieve a \\nstrong primary \\ncare that includes \\neye care. \\ntertiary eye care settings \\n(22-26)\\n, building both a strong primary care \\nand a community delivered eye care can increase the ef˜ciency of eye \\ncare services. of note, building eye care that is integrated into primary \\ncare does not place any less importance on secondary and tertiary \\nlevels. to address population eye care needs, all levels of care \\n(fig. 6.1) \\nwith integrated and effective referral pathways are needed.\\nthere is no single path countries can follow to achieve a strong primary \\ncare that includes eye care. that path may include the integration of \\nprimary eye care services within phc centres, achieved through \\nenhanced supervision and the training of existing staff \\n(box 6.3)\\n, or the \\nadoption of standalone primary eye care services, either in ˜xed \\nfacilities or through mobile units. while technical guidance is not yet \\navailable on how to move forward in building a strong primary care \\nspeci˜c to the eye care sector, the documents, \\na vision for primary health \\ncare in the 21st century\\n (20)\\n and the who technical series on \\nsafer \\nprimary care\\n (27) \\noffer useful resources. \\n124figure 6.1 integrated eye care at all service delivery levels\\nbox 6.3 integration of eye care into primary care through training \\nof existing staff: a case example from tajikistan \\nprimary care doctors (\\nfamily doctors\\n) in tajikistan undergo a professional \\ntraining programme based on the national training curriculum. until recently \\nthis curriculum did not include eye and ear care and, as a result, these \\nservices were not provided at the primary care level throughout the country. \\nin 2018, with technical and ˜nancial support from who, a new hearing and \\nvision module was included in the national training curriculum for primary \\ncare doctors and nurses. during this period who also led awareness raising \\nefforts directly with health workers, to increase acceptance and adherence \\nto the content of the training materials. \\nat present, forty-eight trainers of primary care doctors and nurses have been \\ntrained to educate and demonstrate on how to provide essential ear and \\neye care. basic equipment, such as ophthalmoscopes, is also being provided \\nto the trainers (primary care facilities). as a result of these efforts, primary \\ncare doctors and nurses within tajikistan have already identi˜ed at least a \\nthousand people with previously undiagnosed ear and eye conditions that \\nrequire treatment. in 2019, who will continue to monitor the results of this \\nintervention; in addition, who will fundraise to further strengthen the \\ncapacity of eye and ear care at the tertiary level through additional trainings \\nand the provision of sector speci˜c surgical and other diagnostic equipment.\\n125without good \\ncontinuity and \\ncoordination of \\neye care, patients \\nare at risk of \\nsuboptimal \\noutcomescoordinating services within and \\n across sectors\\nthe coordination of services focuses on improving the delivery of care \\nby aligning and harmonizing processes and information; it does not \\nnecessarily require merging structures, services, or work˛ows. the \\nframework on integrated people-centred health services identi˜es three \\nstrategic approaches: coordinating individuals; coordinating health \\nprogrammes and providers; and coordinating across sectors. all are \\nfundamental to achieving ipec.\\ncoordination of care for the individual involves a range of strategies \\nincluding case management, team-based care, and ef˜cient referral \\nsystems. these strategies contribute to the experience of continuity of \\ncare, whereby the process of care is experienced as discrete, coherent \\nand interconnected, and in line with individual needs and preferences. \\nwithout good continuity and coordination of eye care, patients are at \\nrisk of experiencing fragmented, poorly-integrated care from multiple \\nproviders, often with suboptimal outcomes and high levels of \\ndissatisfaction due to failures of communication, inadequate sharing of \\nclinical information and duplication of investigations \\n(28)\\n. crucial to the \\nongoing success of care coordination is smooth information ˛ow, \\navailable to all care providers \\n(28)\\n. there are recent examples of the \\nsuccessful implementation of well-coordinated and ef˜cient referral \\nnetworks in the ˜eld of eye care \\n(29)\\n.coordinating care for the individual presupposes the coordination of all \\nrelated programmes and providers, and involves bridging information \\ngaps across levels of care as well as ensuring continuity in \\nadministration and funding. additionally, coordinating care may \\nrequire developing networks of health service delivery at the regional or \\ndistrict levels, integrating existing vertical programmes into the health \\nsystems \\n(as described later in box 6.7)\\n, and providing ˜nancial and \\nother incentives.\\ncoordination also encompasses the creation of linkages between eye \\ncare and other health programmes, such as neonatal care, \\nnoncommunicable diseases, rehabilitation and occupational health \\nand safety. successful eye care interventions are being delivered \\nthrough other health services such as retinopathy of prematurity \\nscreening through neonatal care \\n(30)\\n (box 6.4).\\n 126box 6.4 addressing retinopathy of prematurity in neonatal care: a \\ncase study from argentina\\nby the end of the 1990s, retinopathy of prematurity was estimated to be the \\ncause of at least 50% of vision impairment in children \\n(31)\\n. in response, the \\nmoh established a multidisciplinary working group to address the problem. \\nstarting in 2004, training was provided to over 70 neonatal care units in \\npreventing, diagnosing and treating the disease. in 2007, national legislation \\nmandated formal integration and continuation of these services, and \\nongoing funding was subsequently made available through the moh. an \\nimportant feature of the changes was the commitment to ongoing collection \\nof data to monitor progress and identify areas for improvement. \\nsince the programme was established, a 38% reduction has been observed \\nin the number of children with the disease, and a 65% reduction in those who \\nacquired vision impairment as a result \\n(30)\\n.since health care requires multiple actors, both within and outside of \\nthe health sector, coordination of care crosses all sectors, including \\nsocial services, ˜nance, education, labour, and the private sector. \\ncoordination is primarily a governance and leadership issue, \\nnecessitating strong leadership from moh to coordinate intersectional \\naction. the provision of vision rehabilitation services, for example, \\nrequires intersectional partnerships with the social sector so that during \\nthe rehabilitation process, the social and labour sectors can offer other \\nsupport for inclusion and social participation. coordination with the \\neducation sector for the inclusion of programmes for the early \\nidenti˜cation of eye conditions could also be a solution. to this end, \\nthere are a range of guidelines for school based eye care services in \\ndifferent regions and countries. there are also examples of eye care \\ninterventions, such as refractive error screening, provided through the \\neducation sector \\n(32)\\n (box 6.5)\\n. given the growing demands for eye care services, effective options for \\npublicœprivate partnerships need to be explored as a means of \\nproviding affordable eye care. examples already exist of such \\npartnerships that have contributed to providing access to eye care \\nservices to vulnerable communities, including those for the provision of \\nspectacles \\n(box 6.6)\\n and interventions for trachoma control in low-\\nresource settings \\n(39, 40)\\n. 127box 6.5 school eye health programme in baltimore: a case study \\nfrom the usa\\nschool-based vison screening often provides the ˜rst indication of a possible \\nvision impairment or eye condition in children \\n(33)\\n. in the united states of \\namerica it has been found that many children who fail a screening do not \\naccess recommended follow-up care \\n(34, 35)\\n. in response, there has been an \\nincreased focus on delivering follow-up eye care through schools, \\nparticularly in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods \\n(36-38)\\n.in the city of baltimore, a publicœprivate partnership is underway to deliver \\nschool-based eye care to children between the ages of around 4œ14 years. \\nthe baltimore city health department partnered with johns hopkins \\nuniversity wilmer eye institute and school of education, baltimore city public \\nschools, vision to learn and the private sector to create \\nvision for baltim\\nore, \\na city-wide programme providing school-based eye care. johns hopkins has \\nbeen conducting a study alongside the programme to monitor the impact \\nof the intervention on academic performance.\\nsince the project was ˜rst established in 2016, more than 35˚000 children in \\npublic schools have undergone screening, with approximately 12˚000 failing \\nthe screening test. of the 6000 children whose parents permitted a follow-up \\neye examination, approximately 80% were prescribed spectacles. \\nkey lessons learnt to date include the importance of building an alliance \\nbetween health workers and educators to build a school-based model. \\npartners involved in the project are now exploring ways to increase the \\nnumber of families that give permission for the eye examination, as well as \\nhow to promote the wearing and retention of spectacles.\\n128box 6.6 publicœprivate partnerships for the provision of spectacles \\nin pakistan, sri lanka and south africa\\npublicœprivate partnerships in eye care can be bene˜cial, especially where \\nprovision of public services is weak, under-resourced, or inef˜cient. examples \\nfrom pakistan, sri lanka and south africa demonstrate the positive \\noutcomes of the collaboration between the moh and local ngos or ingos \\nfor the population in need of refractive services and spectacle provision.\\nin pakistan, for example, the layton rahmatulla benevolent trust (lrbt) \\nhospital, the largest ngo and eye care provider in the country œ in \\ncollaboration with the government of pakistan and the brien holden vision \\ninstitute œ is currently establishing optical stores in secondary and tertiary \\nhospitals. optical stores are embedded in the lrbt hospital system. when \\npatients are prescribed spectacles by optometrists or ophthalmologists, they \\ncan purchase them from the optical stores located next to the hospital \\npharmacies. since october 2016, lrbt has provided spectacles to 18˚619 \\nindividuals, of whom 68% are women and girls, mostly from low- to middle-\\nincome communities. \\nin sri lanka, the brien holden vision institute, in partnership with ministry of \\nhealth & nutrition, established four vision centres and optical shops to \\nprovide refractive and optical services to semi-urban and rural communities. \\nvision centres have been established in communities where public eye care \\nfacilities were not available and work in close coordination with the health \\ndepartment. patients who need surgical services or are diagnosed with \\ncomplex eye health anomalies are referred to secondary and tertiary eye \\ncare facilities in public or private sectors. to date, 94˚782 people (57% women \\nand girls) have been provided with spectacles by optometrists at the vision \\ncentres.\\nin the kwazulu-natal and gauteng provinces of south africa, the brien \\nholden vision institute, has been providing a spectacle delivery service in \\ncollaboration with department of health since 2007. since the start of the \\ncollaboration, over 165˚000 spectacles have been dispensed, 26˚000 of them \\nat no cost. \\nbesides the provision of spectacles to those in need, these partnerships have \\nalso contributed to the increased awareness of the need for marginalized \\ncommunities to have access to eye care and for local management and \\nmonitoring support for the optical services. \\nhowever, several challenges remain in spectacle supply in these countries. \\navailability of quali˜ed and skilled human resources (optometrists and \\noptical technicians) is a signi˜cant challenge, as there is no standard training \\nprogramme available in many countries. the sector remains unregulated, \\nand local legislation and relevant authorities are insuf˜cient. the informal \\nsector has contributed to the growth of optical street vendors, and online \\neyewear sellers place pressure on the smaller optical chains and \\nindependent vision centres/optical shops.\\n129the ˜rst step is the \\nintegration of eye \\ncare into health \\nsystem planningcreating an enabling environment\\nthe three previous strategies described, will only become operational if \\nenabling environments are in place. who has conceptualized an \\nenabling environment as six building blocks of a health system. of \\nthese six blocks, one \\n œ the delivery of eye care services œ is the focus of \\nipec. although the remaining ˜ve œ leadership and governance; \\ninformation; health workforce; health ˜nancing; and medicines and \\nhealth technologies (including assistive products) are all relevant to \\nrealizing ipec, given the speci˜c challenges faced by the eye care sector \\noutlined in chapter 4, this section will elaborate on leadership and \\ngovernance, health workforce and information only. \\nleadership and governance \\ngood governance involves transparent leadership that is inclusive, \\nparticipatory and makes the best use of available resources and \\ninformation to ensure the best possible results. it is sustained by mutual \\naccountability among those who make and implement policy, \\nmanagers, providers and the users themselves. the responsibilities of \\ngovernance in health care involves developing a strategic plan, then \\nmanaging accountability and overseeing the plan™s implementation. in \\nmost countries, the strategic plan is a national health plan that sets out \\nthe core values of the health system; the health outcome targets to be \\nachieved; a concrete action plan for achieving these targets; and a time \\nframe for doing so. in order to carry out strategic planning, leadership \\nis needed to create a coalition of stakeholders œ across sectors of \\ngovernment and civil society œ to collect information on inputs, service \\naccess, coverage and health outcomes, and to create regulations and \\nformal standards of practice \\n(41)\\n. the importance of strategic planning in the health sector cannot be \\noverstated. unfortunately, as discussed in \\nchapter 4\\n, for most countries, \\neye care is often omitted in national health strategic plans, or only \\nbrie˛y mentioned \\n(42)\\n. to realize ipec in countries, however, the inclusion \\nof eye care in national health strategic plans is of utmost importance \\nfor ensuring that issues of eye care service provision are systematically \\naddressed and fully integrated. the ˜rst step is the integration of eye \\ncare into health system planning, in terms of overall targets and a \\nconcrete plan of how to achieve these targets. secondly, at an \\noperational level, integration will contribute to eye care interventions \\nbeing included across all service delivery platforms and other health \\nareas. finally, integration increases the likelihood of eye care being \\n130considered within broader human resources, assistive products and \\nhealth technology procurement and infrastructure plans.\\neven in situations where a health system is not the main provider or \\n˜nancer of speci˜c eye care services, the role of governance will remain \\nimportant. regulatory frameworks for the engagement of state, private \\nand non-state actors in the eye care sector need to be in place to \\nreduce risking the development and sustainability of equitable eye care \\nservices. when a strong regulatory framework exists and is enforced, \\nprivatization, commercialization and marketization have the potential \\nto increase universal access to eye care services. market forces alone, \\nhowever, will not automatically lead to equitable and universal access. \\nfor this reason, equitable access to eye care must remain a constant \\ngoal and supported by a strong regulatory framework \\n(43)\\n.131information \\nkey components of the information building block include the \\ndevelopment of a health information and surveillance system; the use \\nof standardized tools and instruments; and the collation and \\npublication of national and international health statistics. these \\ncomponents make possible the generation and strategic use of \\ninformation and research on health and health systems.\\na well-functioning his ensures the production, analysis, dissemination \\nand use of reliable and timely health information by health policy, \\nmanagement and clinical decision-makers on a regular basis. as \\npresented in \\nfig. 6.2\\n, a his covers three domains: health determinants; \\nhealth systems capacity and performance (inputs, outputs and \\noutcomes); and health status (impact). to collect information from \\nthese three domains, a his must generate population and facility-\\nbased data from censuses, civil registration data, population surveys, \\nindividual records, and service and resource records by means of \\nstandardized tools and instruments. the system also needs to have the \\ncapacity to synthesize information in the form of sensitive, valid and \\nreliable indicators and the ability to promote the knowledge that arises \\nfrom those indicators. an example of a development of a well-\\nintegrated his in the ˜eld of eye care is described in \\nbox 6.7.\\nfig. 6.2 domains of measurement of health information systems\\n˜˜˚\\n˜˚˜˚\\n˜˚\\n˜˚\\n˜˚˜˚˚\\n˜˚˜˚˜˚\\n˜˚˜˚˜˚\\n˚˙˝\\n˜˚˜˚\\nadapted from \\nframework and standards

well-integrated health information system: a \\ncase study from oman\\nin the 1970s, active trachoma was endemic in oman with an estimated \\nprevalence of 70œ80% among the omani population of all ages. to address \\nthis public health issue, the moh of oman, with assistance from who, \\nstarted a vertical ﬁtrachoma control programmeﬂ with a focus on the \\ntreatment of trachoma in schools. the programme resulted in a substantial \\ndecline in the incidence of the disease to 7% by 1983. due to its success, the \\nmoh expanded the programme and included two additional vertical \\ncomponents, namely the screening of school children, and community \\nscreening in endemic regions. \\nin 1991, the programme was further expanded, renamed the ﬁeye health care \\nprogrammeﬂ and was integrated into the national health care plan of \\noman, focusing on six priority eye conditions: cataract, trachoma, \\nglaucoma, corneal diseases, diabetic retinopathy and refractive error. a \\nnational eye care committee was established to plan the implementation \\nand evaluation of activities relating to eye care in oman. eye care services \\nwere provided through school health services and the moh phc institutions \\nto provide comprehensive eye care. \\nat the end of the 1990s, the national health care plan prioritized eye care \\nunder the ﬁspeci˜c disease control programmesﬂ targeting certain priority \\nhealth problems. all health-care providers were trained in the prevention and \\nmanagement of eye conditions, as well as the recording and evaluating of \\neye care activities. eye care services were expanded to cover all service levels \\nof the health system, including community, primary, secondary and tertiary \\nlevels. in 2014, a national eye strategy with an action plan for 2016œ2020 was \\ndeveloped by the moh in collaboration with who and the eastern \\nmediterranean regional of˜ce of the international agency for the prevention \\nof blindness in accordance with the who global action plan 2014œ2019 \\ntowards universal eye health. \\nthe centralized his is an important part of the eye care services in oman. \\noman initially started an ﬁeye health care monthly reporting systemﬂ in all \\nhealth institutions under the moh and the school eye care. the aim was to \\ncollect monthly data on all vision screenings of preschool-aged children at \\nprimary health care institutions, as well as referrals to secondary or tertiary \\nlevel institutions, and statistical data on the eye care of both outpatients and \\ninpatients from secondary and tertiary centres. as an example, primary eye \\ncare institutions would report new cases of cataract, whereas secondary \\nand tertiary institutions with ophthalmic units would collect information on, \\nand report monthly, all new cataract cases œ which were linked with visual \\nstatus and icd 10 codes œ and all cataract cases managed. with regards \\nrefractive error, secondary and tertiary centres would report all new cases as \\nper the icd codes, whereas cases of refractive error detected at school \\nscreenings would be recorded and reported to the regional school \\nrefractionist as early as possible so that further prompt action could be taken. \\n133in 2008, a national electronic health information management system (the \\nal shifa 3+ system) was launched in oman. al-shifa is being used across all \\nlevels of health-care units with the moh acting as the reporting body. the \\nsystem was designed to meet the needs of all levels of management, \\nincluding data capturing and entering and the delivery of essential \\ninformation needed by the middle management for the day-to-day \\noperations of the health-care facility. the system also acts as a data \\nwarehousing and business intelligence suite which provides national level \\nhealth-care statistics on key performance indicators on different eye \\nconditions (e.g. cataract, refractive error, childhood blindness, diabetic \\nretinopathy, etc.) accumulated from all facilities. these statistics enable the \\ncentral level administration to analyse the overall functioning of health-care \\ncentres across the sultanate, and prepare the national annual report which \\nserves to address gaps in the eye care programme, plan future activities, \\nand strengthen the eye care programme.\\nin addition to the data collected from the health information management \\nsystem, oman uses other sources of information on eye conditions and \\nvision impairment. these include national population-based surveys, such as \\nthe national blindness survey and national glaucoma survey, moh annual \\nstatistical reports, and various national studies on eye care. \\nimplications\\nsince the introduction of the eye care services in oman, the prevalence of \\ntrachoma among the omani population has declined from almost 80% in \\n1970s, to a level where, in 2012, oman became the ˜rst country to be \\ninternationally certi˜ed as trachoma free. in addition, the rate of blindness \\namong those aged 40 years and older declined by approximately 30% \\nbetween 1996 and 2010. there has been a marked increase in the number of \\nophthalmologists in the country, and eye units are now provided with \\nmodern technology and computerized case record systems. through \\nstrengthening the referral system, especially at the primary care level, all \\npatients with diabetes are now referred to ophthalmic units for screening for \\ndiabetic retinopathy. the eye care programme at primary, secondary and \\ntertiary care units have been strengthened by analysing the institutional, as \\nwell as regional, reports on eye care activity through the health information \\nmanagement system.\\n134applied to eye care, and with the objective of moving towards ipec, a \\nhis should collect information about i) the determinants of eye \\nconditions; ii) the capacity of the health system to provide eye care \\nservices as well as its performance, and in particular, how well existing \\neye services address population needs in an equitable manner; and iii) \\nthe numbers of individuals with eye conditions and vision impairment, \\nand their level of functioning and well-being. as illustrated in \\nfig. 6.3\\n, to \\nachieve these goals, tools and instruments need to be in place to collect \\npopulation, facility and system-based data. these data generate \\ninformation about eye care, as well as facilitating research on eye \\nconditions and vision impairment, including research on health systems \\nand eye care. \\nfig. 6.3 \\nalso shows the information generated by each of \\nthe sources and how the information can be used.\\n135figure 6.3 data sources and information for decision-making and

\\nsurveys to generate prevalence estimates of certain eye conditions and \\nvision impairment and the use of standardized tools, such as ecsat \\nand tool for assessment of diabetes and diabetic retinopathy (tadds). \\nnevertheless, as discussed earlier, the eye care sector needs to ensure \\nthat the data generated in population surveys will support eye care \\nservice planning and provide information on the numbers of people of \\nall ages with vision impairment whose needs have been met, as well as \\nthose whose needs have not yet been met. this ensures that \\ncomparable information is collected and reported on important service \\ncoverage indicators.\\nmonitoring the implementation of ipec also requires strategic, systematic \\nplanning to identify which information should be generated from what \\ndata sources (population-, facility- or system-based). relevant indicators \\nneed to be developed. the eye care sector will only be able to report on \\ninterventions covering health promotion, prevention, treatment and \\nrehabilitation; population needs; coordination of services; and the \\nperspectives of eye care users, when comprehensive population-based \\nfacility and systems based data are collected. information from these \\nsources is required for the realization of ipec.\\nworkforce\\nthe realization of ipec largely depends on the availability, accessibility, \\nacceptability and quality of a health workforce and the services they \\nprovide. as outlined in \\nchapter 2\\n, there are, however, human resource \\nchallenges that include general shortages, maldistribution of workers, \\nattrition, imbalances in skill composition and, at times, inadequate \\nregulation \\n(44-48)\\n.until recently, the number of eye care workers per million population \\nhas been used as a guide in workforce planning. while this approach is \\nrelatively simple, it does not consider other determining factors, such as \\npopulation structure, epidemiology, regulations and standards, the \\nlocation of the current workforce and public demand \\n(49)\\n. it assumes \\nthat eye care is delivered by a pre-de˜ned set of health workers only, \\nsuch as ophthalmologists, optometrists or opticians, while in reality, eye \\ncare is delivered by multiple specialized and non-specialized actors, \\nparticularly at primary level. to address the challenges described in \\nchapter 4\\n, and to realize ipec in the context of uhc, the eye care sector, \\nstarting with professional organizations, will need to work closely with \\nrelevant policy-makers in countries responsible for developing policies \\nto optimize the supply of health workers. ipec will require \\ncomprehensive planning of the eye care workforce, inclusive of all \\nhealth workers involved at the entry point of health care (primary care) \\nand based on an in-depth analysis of the health labour market in \\n137ipec depends on \\nthe availability,

better understand the challenges facing the eye care health \\nworkforce, countries need comprehensive assessments on the \\navailability of health workers with skills in eye care which requires \\ninvestment in his. at the wha in may 2016, and as part of the global \\nstrategy on human resources for health, member states were urged to \\nprogressively implement the national health workforce accounts \\n(nhwa) \\n(52)\\n. who has developed overall guidance and a series of \\nnhwa tools to improve, over time, the availability, quality and use of \\ndata through monitoring standardized indicators on health workforce. \\nwith improved data through nhwa, health labour market analysis can \\nbe conducted, and can facilitate the understanding of eye care \\nworkforce dynamics which involves the assessment of the supply and \\ndemand of health workers involved in eye care. \\nin general terms, the supply œ i.e. the number of quali˜ed health workers \\nwilling to work for the eye care sector œ is determined by wages, working \\nconditions, safety conditions and career opportunities. the demand for \\nhealth workers is determined by the needs of the population and the \\ndemand for eye care services. there are, however, many dynamic \\nfactors that need to be considered when planning the eye care \\nworkforce. for instance, supply depends on the extent to which the \\nprivate and public institutions are willing and able to pay for health \\nworkers involved in eye care to be employed in primary care centres, \\nclinics, hospitals or other parts of the health system. institutions also \\ncompete with each other on wage rates, budgets, provider payment \\npractices, labour regulations and hiring rules. the eye care sector \\nsimilarly competes with other health areas in attracting health workers. \\nhealth systems involved in eye care cannot deliver adequate services \\nwithout addressing the role of the private sector in all aspects of \\nworkforce planning, from education to the labour market. these \\npolicies include regulations on staff training, service quality and dual \\npractice, to ensure equitable access to quality health services for the \\nentire population. although, in many countries, it is dif˜cult to \\ndetermine the exact proportion of eye care delivered in the private \\nsector, and of health workers engaged in dual practice, both are known \\nto be high. however, there is little evidence as to whether this has \\npositive or negative consequences for the availability of health workers \\ninvolved in eye care or the quality of services. this lack of evidence \\nshould stimulate not only the development of policies speci˜cally \\ndesigned to regulate the private sector, but also health policy and \\nsystem research in the ˜eld of workforce in the eye care sector. \\nwhen implementing ipec, it is vital to ensure that the eye care sector \\norients eye care workforce planning towards the primary care setting. \\nthis not only requires ensuring that primary care personnel have the \\ncompetencies required to provide eye care interventions œ particularly \\nthose for early identi˜cation and referral to specialized eye care when \\nit is vital to ensure \\nthat the eye care \\nsector orients eye \\ncare workforce \\nplanning towards \\nthe primary care \\nsetting. \\n140required œ but also for the development of policies to facilitate the \\ncoordination of health workers providing services at primary care level.\\nrealizing ipec also requires a competency-based care approach to \\nworkforce planning. competencies refer to the speci˜c tasks an \\nindividual must be able to perform to a speci˜ed standard to qualify as \\na professional. competences are needed for different interventions, and \\nhealth workers with appropriate competences and skills will be required \\nat each service delivery level. there are already examples where the eye \\ncare sector is moving towards competency-based planning approaches \\n(box 6.8)\\n. the who regional of˜ce for africa has recently developed \\ncore competencies for the eye care workforce in the african region to \\nimprove the distribution of skills in the eye team \\n(53)\\n. box 6.8 competency-based eye care: an example from fiji and \\npapua new guinea\\nsmall island developing states can ˜nd it challenging to develop and \\nmaintain cadres of specialist health-care workers. in the paci˜c, the fred \\nhollows foundation, new zealand developed a training programme to build \\neye care competencies for nurses and doctors. \\nthe paci˜c eye institute (pei) was established in 2006 offering a post-\\ngraduate diploma in eye care for nurses, and a master of medicine in \\nophthalmology for doctors. the diploma for nurses has been speci˜cally \\ndesigned to ensure nurses have the competencies to respond to population \\neye care needs in the region, such as refraction and health promotion. in \\nrecognition of the increasing prevalence of diabetes in the region, a \\ncompetency on screening, grading of images for diabetic retinopathy and \\nreferrals has recently been added to the curriculum. \\nthe diploma is now offered in fiji and papua new guinea, and around 150 \\nnurses from 11 countries have completed the quali˜cation, which is \\nrecognized by many governments in the region.\\ninnovative workforce approaches, such as shifting activities between \\nhealth workers through role delegation, will be needed to address \\ninef˜ciencies and enhance equity in the eye care service delivery \\n(54)\\n. role delegation has the potential to expand the number of mid-level \\nhealth-care workers that can safely provide clinical tasks, or key \\ncomponents of tasks, that would otherwise be restricted to higher level \\ncadres such as ophthalmologists. such a shift would require action on \\nthe continuous professional education and on educational accreditation \\nmechanisms. if policies allowing the effective use of de˜ned skills and \\ncompetencies of the health workforce are enforced, a more rational \\ndistribution of tasks and responsibilities among health workers involved \\nin eye care can be created to improve access and cost-effectiveness \\n(46)\\n. some countries have already enabled mid-level health workers to \\ndeliver a range of eye care services, using these cadres, either alone, or \\nas part of teams within communities and health care facilities at \\ndifferent levels of the health system \\n(55)\\n.141finally, strengthening eye care delivery according to population needs \\nthrough a strengthened eye care workforce can yield dual positive \\neconomic bene˜ts: (i) it reduces the impact of eye conditions and vision \\nimpairment on populations and, thus, productivity can be increased; \\nand (ii) it creates jobs, directly and indirectly, in the health workforce \\nwith skills to address eye care needs. the un high-level commission on \\nhealth employment and economic growth reported in 2016 that the \\nhealth sector is one of the sectors with highest potential to economic \\ngrowth \\n(56)\\n. health workforce ˜nancing should therefore be seen as an \\ninvestment and not as a cost.\\nputting into effect ipec and securing uhc will not be possible unless the \\ninef˜ciencies of the eye care workforce are eliminated, adequate \\nfunding secured, and the productivity and performance of health \\nworkers improved. health workforce policies are needed to address \\nworker shortages and maldistribution. such policies need to be tailored \\nto individual country context and population eye care needs. \\nto achieve the goal of integrating eye care into uhc, the \\nworld report on \\nvision\\n proposes the adoption of ipec œ the integrated, people-centred \\napproach to eye care service delivery. ipec has the potential to address \\nmany of the key challenges to the effective delivery of eye care services \\ndescribed in the report: services that are fragmented, of unequal quality, \\nand not effectively provided at the primary care level; an uncoordinated \\nand, at times, unregulated workforce that leads to shortages and \\nmaldistribution; and poor integration of eye care information into his. \\nipec promotes equity in the provision of services according to population \\nneeds, and is therefore crucial to

people have a vision impairment, of whom at \\nleast 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented \\nor has yet to be addressed. population ageing, coupled with lifestyle \\nchanges, is leading to a dramatic increase in the number of people with \\neye conditions and vision impairment. in addition to urgently addressing \\nthis increasing coverage gap, health systems must sustain care for those \\nwhose needs are already being met. the extent of these met and unmet \\nneeds is currently unknown. however, suf˜cient evidence is available to \\nact now; every country can take action, irrespective of the maturity of \\ntheir health system or level of development. \\nfortunately, eye care is an area of health care with highly cost-effective \\ninterventions for health promotion, prevention, treatment and \\nrehabilitation to address the full range of needs associated with eye \\nconditions and vision impairment across the life course. the bene˜ts for \\nthe individual and society are signi˜cant. addressing eye care needs \\nalso contributes intrinsically to progress towards uhc and the sdgs.\\nthe \\nworld report on vision\\n shows the substantial progress made during \\nthe past 30 years, thanks to concerted global advocacy and actions. \\nnevertheless, unmet needs remain: inequalities in coverage exist, and \\nensuring quality is a challenge. in the report, ipec is proposed as an \\napproach that ensures the delivery of eye care in adherence to \\nuniversal health coverage.\\nto realize integrated people-centred eye care, each country or region \\nneeds to assess its current situation and context before mapping out \\nspeci˜c next steps. five global priority areas and recommended actions \\nare identi˜ed:\\n1481. make eye care an integral part of universal health \\ncoverage\\nin order to eliminate inequalities in access to, and provision of, eye care \\nservices across the population, it is essential to plan these services \\ncarefully and according to the best available information about \\npopulation needs, while ensuring quality. until recently, the eye care \\nsector has concentrated on reporting unmet needs. effective planning \\nof quality eye care services as part of uhc also requires information \\nabout ongoing and met needs and ensuring that the cost of priority \\neye care interventions does not expose the user to catastrophic \\nexpenditures.\\nrecommended actions are:\\n     collecting and reporting information on the met and unmet eye care \\nneeds of the national population.\\n     developing a package of eye care interventions to respond to \\npopulation needs for strategic inclusion into the budgeting of uhc.\\n     improving access with ˜nancial risk protection for priority eye care \\ninterventions, especially for low-income groups and other \\ndisadvantaged groups.\\n     de˜ning the desired outcomes of eye care interventions, for quality \\nassurance, and reporting effective coverage.\\n     de˜ning input, output and outcome indicators to monitor the quality \\nof eye care at the national level, and to make comparisons across \\ncountries.\\n     ensuring that individuals with vision impairment or blindness that \\ncannot be treated have access to high-quality vision rehabilitation to \\noptimize functioning.\\n1492.  implement ipec in health systems\\nipec has the potential to overcome the challenges facing countries in \\nproviding access to priority eye care services œ such as shortages of \\ntrained workforce, fragmented services and, at times, suboptimal \\nquality outcomes œ and in ensuring equitable access for all people. a \\nhealth systems perspective is required, and recognition of the necessity \\nto integrate services and respond to people™s needs and preferences. \\nrecommended actions are:\\n     integrating eye care into national health strategic plans.\\n     strengthening eye care in phc to improve access, and to adapt and \\nrespond to rapidly changing population needs, including the \\nprojected growth in the number of people with noncommunicable \\neye conditions.\\n     increasing effective coverage of refractive error and effective \\ncoverage of cataract surgery œ the leading causes of addressable \\nvision impairment and blindness.\\n     managing and delivering eye care services so that people receive a \\ncontinuum of interventions addressing promotion, prevention, \\ntreatment, and rehabilitation across service delivery levels and sites. \\n     reinforcing the coordination of eye care services in relevant \\nprogrammes (e.g. diabetes, maternal child health, ageing); and \\nsectors (e.g. social, education and labour).\\n     ensuring that eye care workforce planning is an integral part of \\nhealth workforce planning.\\n     ensuring that health information systems include comprehensive \\ninformation about eye care to identify needs; to effectively plan \\nservice delivery; and to monitor progress towards implementing ipec \\nand its impact at the population level.\\n1503.  promote high-quality research \\nto sustain implementation of ipec, high-quality implementation and \\nhealth systems research is required, thus complementing existing \\nevidence for effective eye care interventions. moreover, studies \\nanalysing the costs and bene˜ts of implementing the package of eye \\ncare interventions at the individual and societal level will be necessary. \\neye care has a high potential of bene˜ting from technological \\nadvances; research is required to ensure such advances impact on \\nclinical care and people™s lives. \\nrecommended actions are:\\n     supporting the creation of a global research agenda that includes \\nhealth systems and policy research, and technological innovation for \\neye care that facilitate the development of a national research \\nagenda.\\n     promoting collaboration between researchers and ministries of health \\nto ensure research is relevant to the national setting and to the \\nimplementation of ipec.\\n     creating or enhancing existing funding schemes for implementation \\nand health systems research for eye care.\\n     promoting return on investment studies to provide evidence on how \\ninvesting in eye care secures health, social and economic return. \\n     strengthening implementation research for scaling-up technological \\nadvances and task-sharing to ensure they rapidly bene˜t people with \\neye conditions and vision impairment.\\n     encouraging governmental and private foundations in their support \\nof research on innovative treatments and diagnostics both to \\neliminate blindness from eye conditions, and to eliminate eye \\nconditions. \\n1514.  monitor trends and evaluate progress\\nit is important to monitor the progress made towards implementing \\nipec and its impact at the population level. this requires comprehensive \\ninformation from health information systems on eye care and \\nepidemiological data on eye conditions and vision impairment. \\nindicators and benchmarking are also required to evaluate progress \\ntoward implementation. \\nrecommended actions are:\\n     strengthening national capacity to collect, analyse and use data on \\nthe burden and trends of eye conditions and vision impairment.\\n     conducting periodic population surveys that include measurement of \\nvision impairment, as de˜ned in this report, and integrate variables \\nrelevant to eye care in general health surveys, ensuring that effective \\ncoverage of cataract surgery and refractive errors can be reported. \\n     supporting the creation of a global indicators menu for eye \\nconditions and vision impairment that facilitates the selection of \\nnational indicators and promotes cross-country comparisons.\\n     de˜ning how to, and periodically conducting, evaluations of the \\nprogress made towards implementation of ipec.\\n1525. raise awareness and engage and empower people \\nand communitiesthe public and individual communities œ speci˜cally underserved \\npopulations, such as women, migrants, indigenous peoples, and \\npersons with certain kinds of disability œ need to be made aware of the \\nimportance of early identi˜cation of eye conditions; the need to prevent \\nand address vision impairment; and how they can be empowered to \\ngain access to eye care services.\\nrecommended actions are:\\n     raising awareness about the availability of effective interventions \\nthat address all eye care needs across the life course. \\n     conducting public health campaigns that emphasize the importance \\nof eye care.\\n     engaging and empowering the public, speci˜cally underserved \\npopulations, to be aware of their eye care needs and demand and \\nseek eye care services. \\n     engaging the education and labour sectors as partners in raising \\nawareness about the importance of identifying eye conditions and \\naccessing eye care services among students and employees.\\n     raising awareness of the societal obligation to ful˜l the rights of \\nindividuals with vision impairment and blindness that cannot be \\ntreated, to participate in society on an equal basis with others.\\n153 annexes\\n154annex i: regional comparisons of the numbers \\n of people with selected eye conditions\\nfig. a1.1 regional
