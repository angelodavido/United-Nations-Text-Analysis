And when we looes, based \\non countries where we know the number of peo\\n-ple actually reacdinated \\nappeals, we see that lesle in \\nneed are actually reached. While this does not \\ninclude all of humanitarian assistance, given the \\nwork of many actors Œ including those \\nof the International Red Cross and Red Crescent \\nMovement, and many local and national actors \\nŒ it remains clear that collectively we as human\\n-itarians are leaving millions of people behind. \\nFor all the good we undoubtedly do, we are not \\ndoing anything like enough, for anything like \\nenough\\n people. \\nWe should pay heed to the statistics Œ but we \\nshould also pay heed to the stories behind the \\nstatistics. Who are these millions of peop\\nbehind? Every human being has a name, a story \\nŒ and a beating heart Œ but names and stories \\nare so oen subsumed by the words we use to \\ntry to present the challenges of our times. The \\nmissing millions become ‚cr\\n-lations™, ‚migrants™, ‚refugees™, ‚beneciaries™ Œ or \\njust the neglected, the dispossessed, the\\n dead.\\nWatching largely African migrants arrive on the \\nAquarius in the port of Valencia, Spain in June \\nˆˇ˛˘, I found myself thinking about their indi\\n-vidual stories, and the thousands before them \\nand the thousands who will follow them Œ peo\\n-ple who arrived and made a new life; people who \\narriveams; people who never arrived, and who lie in a watery \\ngrave; and people still to come. And the migrants who come to Europe who are of course \\njust a tiny proportion of the millions of people worldwide for whom home is no longer \\nsafe, and who havlaces like Afghanistan, Eritrea, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, Syria \\nand many\\n others. \\nMany more of the millions of peope still ‚at home™. \\nEach person has a name and a\\n story. \\nWhen we ask ourselves , we conjure the image that some\\n-one, somehow Œ due to others™ negligence or others™ intention Œ has not gone forward, \\nwhen others have. I am reminded of the story of the shepherd who sets out from among \\nwho is lost. e incomplete without the \\none. Our shared humanity Œ the alpha and omega of all principled humanitarian action \\nŒ decrees that none are safe until all are safe, and that none are well until all are\\n well. \\nThe World Disasters Report \\nstresvulnerable people and the \\npeople most in need who fall through the cracks. It also calls on us to start taking seriously \\nhow people a˚ected by crwn needs. In the International Red Cross and \\nRed Crescent Movement, we are working hard to do a better job of listening in this way, \\nincluding through agreeing minimum standards for community engagement and account\\n-ability throughout our\\n programming. \\nMost importantly, perhaps, the \\nWorld Disasters Report \\no˚ers solutions. Most of these revolve \\naround the fact that it™s hard to leave people behind if you are actually there in the com\\n-munity st place. That is why the report makes the case for local action, \\nto be carried out by the local humanitarians who live and work among the communities \\nthey serve, who are from those communities, and who are there before, dur\\na crisis. It means ‚walking the last mile™ Œ to the most vulnerable people, and the hardest \\nto reacst mile. These are the people who we need to \\nreacst, not last. They should be the forethought, not the\\n ht.\\nSo, on top of looking at understanding who is in need and what those needs are, the \\nWorld \\nDisasters Report \\nexamines how to remove the barriers to assisting the people who are hard\\n-est to reach, how to implement the programmes that meet the unmet needs, how to work \\nwith and support a diverse range of local actors, and how to build a more e˚ective system \\nthat examines how its funding is made available, and how it is\\n spent.Thank you to all those who have contributed not just to this publication, but also to a \\nglobal debate of profound importance.

But millions of people are leˆ behind in humanitarian\\n crises. \\nPrecise ˇgures remain elusive (given measuring need is an inexact art), but the UN O˘ce \\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian s™ Global Humanitarian Overview (OCHA, \\nle will require humanitarian assistance world\\n- It further estimates that arle would be selected for \\ninternational assistance under the joint humanitarian response plans, lea\\nwhich would only be partially met by domestic authorities or other organiyations includ\\n-ing the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Looking at several major \\noperations from ˜˚˛ in some cases fewer than half of the people estimated to be in need \\nwere actually known to be reached by internationally supported humanitarian\\n assistance. \\nThere are many ways in which people with signiˇcant humanitarian needs are leˆ behind \\nby the humanitarian sector (including humanitarian agencies and their donors). While the \\ngroups passed over, and the reasons they are missed, sometimes change, there are clear \\ncommon routes to\\n exclusion. \\nWorld Disasters Report \\nasks challeng admittedly \\noverburdened donors, and local and international humanitarian organizations. It includes \\na strong call for more, for better and for more equitable, funding and action to meet the \\nrising needs. It also calls for a more conscious and transparent approach to ensuring the \\npeople in greatest need are placed ˇrst in line for\\n assistance. \\nThe report identiˇes ˇvws that are allowing so many people to fall through the \\ncracks: too manyle are ˛) \\nout of sight\\n, ˜) \\nout of reach\\n, ˙) \\nle˜ out of the loop, or ˇnd \\nthemselves in crises that ar\\nout of money, or deemed to be ˝) \\nout of scope \\nbecause they \\naring in ways that are not seen as the responsibility of the humanitarian\\n sector. \\n9Out of reach: the people we can™t get\\n toSome communities are hard to reach for geographical or political reasons, because of con\\n-ity, or bureaucratic and legal bottlenecks created by\\ndonors alike. These can all pose serious challenges to humanitarian\\n access.\\nThere are a range of physical, logistical and technological barriers to humanitarian access \\nthat are linked to challenging terrain and limited infrastructure and exacerbated by con\\n-al hazards. It is signiˇcantly more expensivo\\n-vide services in remote areas with a widely dispersed population, for example, or in areas \\nwith extremes of climate and topography. There are also security challenges in many con\\n-texts that make certain populations di˘cult for humanitarian service providers to\\n reach.\\nHumanitarian action is also hindered or prevented by legal, political and administrative \\nfactors. International organizations in particular oˆen need to consider not only the risks \\nogrammes in a given context, but also the risk of potential future complica\\n-tions, for example where there are tensions in providing impartial humanitarian assistance \\nin a manner that also complies with laws and policies of national governments and\\n donors.\\nAny humanitarian operation that involves risk Œ such as to the safety and security, \\nto a programme continuing, to an organization™s ability to operate elsewhere or to its \\ncommitment to high standards of accountability Œ will involve a far higher ˇnancial cost \\nthan one that does not.This highlights one of the fundamental humanitarian dilemmas: how far should human\\n-itarian action stretch to reach populations where the access will be very di˘cult, and \\nthereby costly and\\n risky?\\nLeft out of the loop: the people we \\nunintentionally\\n exclude\\nA lack of insight on the part of humanitarian organizations can leave people and commu\\n-nities at risk even when support is being provided Œ because it is not the right kind of sup\\n-ed in ways that the target population cannot understand or\\n access.\\nGeneric programming approaches oˆen fail to meet the speciˇc needs of particular groups. \\nFor example, they oˆen use language and communication tools that work for humani\\n-tarians but are not understood by the people in need, or assistance may be provided in a \\nway that is easiest for humanitarians but cannot be physically accessed due to physical, \\ncultural, social or poget\\n population.Out of sight: the people we fail to\\n seeThe humanitarian sector cannot help people if it fails to see them. Sometimes this takes a \\n For example, people whose births are not registered or who lack proof of \\nidentity arely out of sight when it comes to receiving the assistance they\\n need.\\nThis lack of visibility also extends to problems no one wants to talk about, such as sex\\n-violence Œ which is systematically underestimated in disaster set\\n-tings Œ and it also frequently includes the issues faced by marginalized groups. The con\\n-sequences for minory crises Œ such as sexual and ethnic minorities and \\nmigrants Œ are oˆen the most\\n unseen.Many communities and settlements are also overlooked for reasons of inaccessibility, pov\\n-erty and marginalization. Areas that are changing and expanding at a rapid rate, such as \\nurban slums, are oˆen largely unmapped. This can havluding those peo\\n-ple living there from disaster planning and restrict their access to resources and\\n support.\\n˜˚˛˝˙˛ˆ˙ˇ˛˝˘\\n˜˚˛˝˙˛ˆ˙ˇ˛˝˘ˆ\\n˜˚˛˝˙˛ˆ˙ˇ˛˝˘\\n˜˚˛˝˙˛ˆ˙ˇ˛˝˘\\n\\n1011Out of scope: the people who ‚aren™t \\nour problem™\\nMany of the world™s most vulnerable people do not receive support from the humani\\n-tarian sector because their needs or crises do not ˇt into traditional areas of concern of \\nthe humanitarian sector. This is oˆen true, for example, of the specentiated \\nneeds of people trapped in protracted crises Œ or who are not aided to become resilient \\nin advance of crisis Œ as they fall between the cracks in the perceived ‚turf™ of develop\\n-ment and humanitarian actors and funding\\n streams.\\nHowever, there are also some groups of peoping widespread, acute crisis very sim\\n-ilar to ‚traditional™ humanitarian crises ing has not attracted major support \\nfrom the humanitarian\\n sector.\\nTwo vivid and shocking examples of this are the situations of (nonefugee) irregular \\nmigrants and people facing major situations of urban violence. In both cases, the response \\nof the international humanitarian sector has been minimal despite suring akin to \\ncatastrophes that might otherwise lead to major international appeals and widespread \\nmedia coverage.\\nTheir situations raise the question Œ is the humanitarian sector choosing to respond on \\nthe basis of objective criteria or the force of habit? As the nature and contexts of human \\ning continue to change, how can the humanitarian sector continue to evolve and \\nwherever it is needed\\n most?RecommendationsThe World Disasters Report\\n sets out recommendations in six main areas, and addresses spe\\n-ciˇc calls to action in each area to governments, international humanitarian organiza\\n-tions and donors.\\n1. Getting the incentives\\n rightWe recommend that donors deˇne ‚value for money™ in light of the goal of leaving no one \\nbehind, and reaching the people most in need Œ even if doing so is more expensive. This \\nmeans prioritizing the people who are hardest to reach and incentivizing their assistance \\nthrough proactive and tailored strategies and tools. These include allocating funds specif\\n-icallyeach groups, and removing disincentives \\nto working in hareach areas, including approaches that shiˆ risk down the imple\\n-mentation chain rather than sharing and jointly mitigating the risks. We recommend that \\nhumanitarian organizations systematically integrate steps to support the people hardest \\nPeople most at risk do not always receive the assistance and information they need in a \\nmanner that meets their needs. In particular, too many relief programmes are not ade\\n-quately tailored to speciˇc needs. These failings are most systematic and alarming when \\nit comes to older people and persons with disabilities. The sector too oˆen leaves these \\npeople out of its disaster planning and fails to take their particular needs and capacities \\ninto account.Out of money: the people we \\ndon™t\\n prioritizeThe massive and growing gap between the funds required and the funds available for human\\n-itarian response is a major factor behind the exclusion of the world™s most vulnerable peo\\n-ple. Humanitarians Œ local or international Œ may know the needs, but not have the funds \\nand other capacities to meet them (in ˜˚˛, for example, only ˚% of UNcoordinated \\nappeal requirements were met). This gap is widening and has been for many\\n years.\\nThis is not a new ˇnancing gap Œ humanitarian funding has been increasingly outpaced \\nby need for well over a decade. But now, as the volumes of known international human\\n-itarian assistance have reached record levels, so have the demands made on it. The data \\nsuggests that while aid levels may be reaching their peak, the level of need has not yet \\nreached its\\n peak.The World Disasters Report\\n asks which responses are ‚out of money™, what are the causes, \\nwhat are the consequences and what solutions can be found? It focuses on three types \\nof underfunded crisis Œ small rapdisasters, larger slodisasters and long-\\nterm complex\\n emergencies.\\nManys cause severe damage and tr\\ndo not trigger international appeals or generate major headlines. The cost of response \\nand recovery can nevertheless be beyond the means of national responders, and interna\\n-tional funding may be too stretched,le or slow to\\n react.\\nLarger sloet disasters seldom meet with a strong response from donors, with appeals-\\nbased calls for funding being notoriously unreliable. Even with clear early warning of a \\ndisaster, calls for support are overlooked or not prioritized when viewed alongside more \\nurgent requests for acute\\n needs.Meanwhile,m complex emergencies are prone to funding fatigue, where high \\nlevm humanitarian ˇnancing cannot be sustained in the face of chronic \\nneeds and lm development donors are unable to invest or constrained by per\\n-ceived ˇnancial\\n risks.\\nIn these cases, people are at high risk of being leˆ behind by humanitarian\\n response.\\n12134. Taking up our shared responsibility for\\n resilienceWe recommend that all governments (including donors) and humanitarian organizations \\ninvest much more heavily in community resilience and local response capacities before \\ndisasters and other crises. This means scaling up the use of anticipatory funding for pre\\n-dictable and recurrent hazards in international and domestic response systems, and pro\\n-moting legal and policy frameworks for disaster risk management that focus on the needs \\nof the most vulnerable people. We recommend that donors ensure that funding struc\\n-tures for development, climate and humanitarian assistance promote resilience, local \\ncapacity and preparedness. And we recommend that humanitarian organizations system\\n-atically include resilience strengthening in their interventions, unless they lack the rel\\n-evant competence or capacity or such activity would undermine their compliance with \\nhumanitarian\\n principles.\\nThe IFRC commits to continuing its support for resilience building, including, where \\npossible, through incorporating relevant activities into emergency operations, support\\n-ing National Societies to strengthen community resilience, and supporting the develop\\n-ment of legislative and policy frameworks for cisk\\n management.5.\\n Improving appropriate use of data and\\n technology\\nWe recommend that all governments (including donors) and humanitarian organizations \\ninvest in stronger data gathering and analysis capacities across the humanitarian sector \\nand at the national level. This should focus on ˇnding people and needs that might be \\nout of sight Œ in particular older people and persons with disabilities. They should ensure \\nthat there is agreement on basic data standards and methodology to ensure comparability \\nand interoperability, as well as adherence to a strong m™ approach to data pro\\n-tection and sharing. At the same time, gathering data must not become an end in itself; \\nit must not replace\\n action.The IFRC commits to continuing to invest in its own and its members™ capacity to gather \\nand analyse relevant data designed to identify the people most in need and detect any\\n-one who might be leˆ behind. This will include building our own data literacy, improv\\n-ing our gathering of sex, age and disability disaggregated data, increasing participation in \\nopen source approaches to data sharing in the sector, and developing and implementing \\nappropriate data protection and privacy\\n policies.\\n6.\\n Addressing the critical\\n casesWe recommend that all governments (including donors) and humanitarian organizations \\nguard against blind spots when it comes to assistance for people lacking gover\\n-sued identiˇcation, without formal title to their homes, whose communities are not \\nmapped, and who silently endure hidden crises, suc\\n violence.\\nIt is important to ensure that humanitarian budgets, plans and ˇnancing incorporate spe\\n-ciˇc allocations and programmes to groups with particular needs, including older people \\nand persons with disabilities, working with dedicated local organizations, where they exist. \\nMeeting the needs of irregular migrants and of people experiencing urban violence should \\nto reach into their appeals and response plans, including, where necessary, prioritizing \\nmitigation of security risks (both for themselves and their local partners).\\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) commits \\nto prioritizing support to the people most in need in its own operations, regardless of the \\ndi˘culty in reaching\\n them.2. Recognizing and supporting the role of local humanitarian\\n actionWe recommend that donors invest in local responders,m insti\\n-tutional capacities, including providing support to develop and implement policies and \\nprocedures around capacity development for managing international funds, fraud, account\\n-ability and safeguarding as well as to ensure safety of\\n .\\nWe recommend that governments invest their own resources in local response capacities, \\nincluding those of civil society, at the domestic level, to reduce their reliance on inter\\n-national funding. This should include developing the necessary laws and procedures to \\nfacilitate and regulate international assistance. And we recommend that humanitarian \\norganizations strengthen their partnerships with local responders, with a conscious goal \\nof devolving decm capacity, and ˇnd ways to better \\nintegrate local knowledge (in particular about cultural issues, hidden vulnerability and \\nlocal capacities) into needs assessments, in particular through investing in pr \\nmapping exercises with local partnerone\\n states.The IFRC commits to continue to strengthen its investment in the operational and func\\n-tional capacity of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies as frontline responders \\nto support their delivery of relevant\\n services.3.\\n Adopting a community-centred, participatory\\n approach\\nWe recommend that humanitarian organizations prioritize the integration of community \\nparticipation in all areas of programming, ideally before, but at least from the very begin\\n-ning of a crisis Œ and share feedback morely across aid organizations. This should \\ninclude paying particular attention to the people likely to be passed over, such as women, \\nolder people and persons with disabilities. It is important to ensursessment \\nmethods and approaches seek out and ˇnd marginalized groups and the people most in \\nneed, even if they are not in ‚traditional categories™, and actively seek relevant information \\nin the preparedness phase before disasters strike. We also recommend that donors prior\\n-itize resources for community engagement activities and ensurility in how funds \\nare allocated to programmes throughout a crisis so that course correction based on feed\\n-back from communities can\\n occur.\\nThe IFRC commits to strengthening its community engagement and accountability, \\nand to ensuring greater use of the outcomes of vulnerability and capacity assessments in \\nresponse\\n programming.\\n1415also be prioritized, bearing in mind that local responders will likely continue to be best \\nplaced to undertake most response initiatives, but will require additional resources to do\\n so.\\nThe IFRC commits to continue its work with National Societies to support vulnerable \\ngroups regardless of where they are. This includes work to reduce, prepare for and respond \\nto sexual and genderbased violence in disaster settings and speciˇc initiatives with and for \\nolder people and persons with disabilities. It will continue to support National Societies \\nin strengthening services for migrants and to build understanding with their authorities \\nabout their role and contributions. The IFRC further commits to supporting National \\nSocieties to develop activities to prlence and to meet the psychosocial \\nneeds of victims of urban\\n violence.\\nConclusionsHumanitarian action has never been able to come close to ending all ing caused by \\n disasters and other crises. Di˘cult choices are commonplace in the worst situ\\n-ations and this will continue to be the case. The \\nWorld Disasters Report\\n nevertheless argues \\nthat the humanitarian sector can Œ and must Œ make a str\\nurgent\\n needs.The report explores how humanitarians Œ acting alone or in partnership with others Œ \\ncan improve their practices to leave fewer people behind. It challenges all those engaged \\nin humanitarian action Œ the donors, the multilateral, international, national and local \\nservice providers Œ to constantly seek to identify the people most in need and hardest to \\nreach, to identify people who may be excluded for all of the reasons outlined here and \\nmore, and to make these people the top\\n priority. \\n16Executive Summary\\n 1. Introduction\\nThe ˜rst six chapters\\n of the World Disasters Report ˜˚˛˝\\n focus on the theme of leaving no \\none behind in humanitarian response. Consultations with National Red Cross and Red \\nCrescent Societies around the world supported the selection of issues, guided by the \\nexamples most frequently cited when asked to identify people le˚ behind. While this is \\nnot intended to be a comprehensive or systematic review of all the gaps, it re˛ects the \\nexperience and concerns of the global International Federation of Red Cross and Red \\nCrescent Societies (IFRC) network and of the community˝based volunteers at its\\n core.\\nThe seventh chapter, \\nDisaster trends and IFRC insights \\nrevives an earlier World Disasters \\nReport tradition of a dedicated section of the report outside the thematic focus, look\\n-ing at trends in disasters and disaster management from the point of view of the\\n IFRC. \\nLeaving no one behind in \\nhumanitarian\\n response With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in ˙ˆˇ˘, the ambition \\nto ‚leave no one behind™ely become the mission statement of the international \\ndevelopment agenda. While not necessarily phrased the same way, similarly large ambi\\n-tions have long driven humanitarian action as\\n well. \\nThe International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement™s articulation of the Fundamental \\nPrinciple of Humanity commits it to ﬁpreving wherever it \\nmay be foundﬂ. Likewise, the (more than organizational signatories to the Code of \\nConduct of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster \\nRelief ﬁrecognize our obligation to provide humanitarian assistance wherever it is neededﬂ. \\nBut humanitarians have also long worried that they are falling far short of their ambi\\n-tions. the \\nWorld Disasters Report\\n focused on the issue of neglected crises, asking \\nﬁ[w]hich communities languish in the shadows of emergency response and prevention Œ \\nneglected by the media, aid organizations, donors, even by their own governments?ﬂ and \\nfound multiple causes for neglect, ranging from media ˜ckleness to inconsistent needs \\nassessment practices and\\n geopolitics.\\n17Box 1.1\\n The humanitarian ‚system™, ‚sector™ or ‚ecosystem™\\nGlobal reports (and indeed the \\nWorld Disasters Report \\nitself in the past) have gener\\n-ally referred to the ‚humanitarian system™. This term has its advantages, in particu\\n-lar its ability to take into account not only humanitarian organizations but also the \\ninternational ˜nancing that underlies their work. On the other hand, it also implies \\na sort of global machine, with various cogs functioning in an integrated, top-down \\nmanner. This is neither accurate as a description of the current reality (Borton, 2009; \\nBennett, 2018) nor a particularly desirable ideal to aspire\\n to. \\nThe recently ascendant term ‚humanitarian ecosystem™ might be an alternative, with \\nits suggestion that various actors all have different parts to play in a complemen\\n-tary manner. This term also lacks a single de˜nition Œ but given the comprehensive \\nconnotation that the term ecosystem inspires, it should be seen fully to incorporate \\nnot only international actors, funding and mechanisms, but also national and local \\nones (e.g. Maietta, 2017). No ecosystem would make sense without this full\\n picture.\\nUnfortunately, available data on how humanitarianism is carried out at the local level \\nin the absence of international funding and actors is quite fragmented, making it dif\\n-˜cult to come to global conclusions. In light of these limitations, the analysis in this \\nreport mainly focuses on action by international actors or carried out with support \\nfrom international ˜nance (unless otherwise indicated). \\nConsistent with this narrower focus, this edition of the \\nWorld Disasters Report \\nuses the term ‚humanitarian sector™ to refer to international humanitarian organizations \\nand donors. \\nSimilarly, there is currently no single, commonly agreed, de˜nition of ‚humanitarian \\naction™. It has generally been considered a time-limited endeavour, bounded in space \\nand content, with a narrow, principled focus on saving lives and alleviating suffering \\nin times of extremis, and undertaken by a limited number of actors (GHD, 2003). As \\ndiscussed in this chapter, this notion is under some strain as the practices and expec\\n-tations of the humanitarian sector evolve, but will nonetheless inform discussions \\nin this report (precisely to allow for this evolution to be more clearly understood). \\nThe development roots of ‚leaving no one\\n behind™ But what does leaving no one behind really mean? Given that its use in the development \\nagenda has ˜rmly placed it on the map of recent international dialogue, its origins there \\nare an obvious starting\\n point. \\nIn ˙ˆˇ˘, the then UN Secretary˝General hailed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \\nas ﬁthe most successful anti˝poverty movement in historyﬂ and there was certainly impres\\n-sive progress. Since their adoption in ˙ˆˆˆ, the number of people living in extreme pov\\n-erty and the global rate of under-˜ve mortality were both more than halved, maternal \\nThese concerns have become particularly urgent recently, as the gap between identi\\n-˜ed humanitarian needs and available resources has reached new heights Œ in excess of \\nbillion US dollardinated appeals alone (OCHA,). This \\nis despite the size of the international humanitarian sector, and the levels of donor con\\n-tributions, also reaching historical peaks (High Level Panel, At the same time, pres\\n-sure to truly address long˝acknowledged blind spots of the humanitarian community Œ \\nsuch as those concerning gender, internal displacement and disability Œ has also grown \\nevident in the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) process, which made strong use of \\nthe leaving no one behind\\n slogan. \\nLeaving no one behind as an impetus for humanitarian\\n reform It is now widely agreed that the humanitarian sector is ﬁstretched to its limitsﬂ (ALNAP, \\n˙ˆˇ˘a) and that many trends (such as ever˝more protracted crises, climate change, uncon\\n-trolled urbanization, population growth and the globalization˝fuelled circulation of conta\\n-gious disease), are only likely to make its job dramatically harder Œ resulting in even more \\npeople in need being le˚ behind. This shared diagnosis has, ironically, led both to propos\\n-als to expand and to constrict the scope of international humanitarian\\n action. \\nThe WHS itself fell mainly in the former category. Then˝UN Secretary˝GenerKi\\n˝Moon \\ncalled for humanitarians to step out of mandate˝driven silos and work more closely together \\nwith development, peacekeeping and other partners in the areas of ﬁending needﬂ (both \\nthrough peacebuilding and risk reduction), developing long˝term solutions for people \\ntrapped in protracted crises (particularly internally displaced persons), and addressing cli\\n-mate change, among others (UNSG,). \\nOn the other hand, a growing chorus of critics has instead called on the international \\nhumanitarian sector to ﬁlet goﬂ of many of the roles it has gradually taken on and ﬁget \\nback to basicsﬂ (Bennett et al,, ˙ˆˇ˙; Dubois, They urge it to reas\\n-sign extraneous tasks to others, in particular, development agencies and local responders \\n(both governmental and non˝governmental), to concentrate on a more focused\\n approach. \\nWhile the WHS did not immediately lead to sector˝wide transformation, change is nev\\n-ertheless in the air Œ in ‚silo˝busting™ changes at the UN driven by the current Secretary-\\nGeneral; in a driviency in humanitarian action as evidenced by‚Grand \\nBargain™ between donors and agenceviously unheard \\nstakeholders (particularlyle and local responders),ially consulted for \\nthe ˜rst time as part of the run˝up to the WHS. Other ‚system disrupters™ that may drive \\naction for reform include the growing engagement and assertivenes \\nand regional bodies, the much stronger engagement of the World Bank in protracted cri\\n-ses, and the cumulative impact of technological changes that are reducing entry barri\\n-ers to newent kinds of humanitarian responders Œ stretching de˜nitions of the \\n‚system™ (see Box ˇ.ˇ).\\n1819Introduction\\nThe WHS also pressed participants to make a ﬁcore commitmentﬂ, to ﬁtranscend humani\\n-tarelopment divides: work together, toward collective outcomes that ensure human\\n-itarian needs are met, while at the same time reducing risk and vulnerability over multiple \\nyears and based on the comparative advantage of a diverse range of actorsﬂ (WHS, \\nWhile not directly requiring humanitarians to deviate from their core role, however, work\\n-ing toward ‚collective outcomes™ with development actors clearly must have some impact \\non the focus of humanitarians.\\nThis suggestion had its critics. Médecins sans Frontières, for example, pulled out of the \\nWHS, in lareak down walls between development and \\nhumanitarian action (MSF, It has likewise been suggested that the term ‚devel\\n-opment™ inherently requires support for strengthening state institutions, which may be \\nimpossible to reconcile with the principle of independence and the need for humanitar\\n-ian space in con˛ict settings (Guinote, On the other hand, it is also true that the \\nlarge majority of self˝described ‚humanitarian™ organizations, in particular local organi\\n-zations, have considered themselves ‚double˝hatted™ with many ‚development˝like™ activ\\n-ities for a very long time. For example, most humanitarian organizations have embraced \\nthe idea that they should be contributing to risk reduction well before disasters \\nstrike, including strengthening community resilience.\\nˇ Likewise, humanitarian responders \\nhave reached increasingly far into the recovery arena, for example through shelter activi\\n-ties, which increasingly go well beyond ‚tarpaulins and tents™ to provide more permanent \\nsolutions, as well as through some livelihoods\\n approaches.\\nDo these aspirations, which look well beyond immediate life˝saving, also expand the \\nresponsibility of the humanitarian sector, in terms of whom it is expected to serve and \\nwhen? For instance, is it leaving people behind if it does not engage, with vigor propor\\n-tionate to probable long˝term harm, in areas experiencing food insecurity at pre˝crisis \\nlevels (e.g. Integrated Food Security Phase Classi˜cation levels below\\nits duties when it ‚transitions out™ humanitarian aid for people facing chronic poverty? \\nCan it be satis˜ed it has discharged its role when thousands of peopy disas\\n-ters remain in ‚temporary™ shelter years a˚er the triggering\\n event? \\nient to say that the disconnect between needs and resources decreasingly allows \\nhumanitarians even to ful˜l their ‚traditional™ role? Or that the Principle of Impartiality \\npoints them to ‚the most urgent cases of distress™, rendering the long˝term well˝being of \\npeople it serves ‚somebody else™s problem™? \\nIn his commentary on the Principle of Impartiality, Jean Pictet saw the quandary about \\nurgent cases as ﬁcomparable to that of a ra˚ which will sink if any more castaways cling \\nto it. Can one, in all conscience, use an oar and rap the knuckles of human beings, chil\\n-dren perhaps, whose misfortune it is to have not arrived ˜rst?ﬂ Pictet himself could not \\nanswer this question, concluding that it ﬁrepresents a matter of conscience, as it is called, \\nbecause the decision must be le˚ to the individual responsible – Who, a˚er all, can claim \\nto hold the scales of perfect justice?ﬂ (Pictet,\\n˜.\\n For the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, this was strongly signalled in the Agenda for Humanitarian \\nAnational Conference of the Red Cross and Red CrICRC and IFRC, \\n where Movement components and the state parties to the Geneva Conventions pledged together to ﬁprotect \\nhuman dignity, lives and livelihoods from the devastating impact of disasters, bfully integrating disaster risk reduc\\n-tion into national and international planning and policy instruments and implementing appropriate operational meas\\n-ures to reduce risksﬂ.\\nmortality fell by, primary school enrolment in developing countries rose to  and \\nthe proportion of malnourished people was almost halved (UN, ˙ˆˇ˘a).\\nYet the bene˜ts of these advances were not evenly felt. The UN reported that ﬁmillions of \\npeople are being le˚ behind, especially the poorest and those disadvantaged because of \\ntheir sex, age, disability, ethnicity or geographic locationﬂ. Enormous disparities contin\\n-ued between rich and poor countries, between the poorest and richest households and \\nbetween women and men, among\\n others. \\nLeaving no one behind therefore became the top˝level objective of the successor to the \\nMDGs, the SDGs. States pledged that no one will be le˚ behind: ﬁ[r]ecognizing that the \\ndignity of the human person is fundamental, we wish to see the goals and targets met for \\nall nations and peoples, for all segments of society. And we will endeavour to reach the \\nfurthest behind ˜rstﬂ (UN, ˙ˆˇ˘b). \\nMany of the individual goals re˛ect this ambition either by setting equality as their only pur\\n-pose (e.g. Goal ˘: achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, Goal ˇˆ: reduce \\ninequality within and among countries) or by emphasizing that they can only be reached if \\neveryone bene˜ts (e.g. Goal ˇ: end poverty in all its forms everywhere, e healthy \\nlives and promote well˝being for all at all ages). The agenda further requires that data gath\\n-ering and review processes are designed to make good on this pledge. Particularly in light \\nof the commitment to ‚reach the furthest behind ˜rst™, it has been noted that the SDGs™ \\nagenda goes well beyond avoiding discrimination, requiring ﬁprioritisation and fast˝track\\n-ing of actions for the poorest and most marginalised peopleﬂ as well as purposely \\ndesigned to develop baselines and measure progress (Stuart and Samman, \\nImplications for the humanitarian\\n agendaWhat does all this mean for the humanitarian sector, with its particular principles, man\\n-dates and limitations? In theory, it means a much greater involvement of development \\nactors and ˜nancing to address the underlying causes and long˝term consequences of \\ncrises. This is supported by the express inclusion of language about disaster risks in the \\nSDGs, which, for example, calls for ﬁbuild[ing] the resilience of the poor and those in \\nvulnerable situations and reduc[ing] their exposure and vulnerability to climate related \\nextreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disastersﬂ and \\naims to ﬁsigni˜cantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of peop– \\nby disasters– with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situationsﬂ.\\nThe reality, however, is that the humanitarian sector is itself increasingly expected to con\\n-tribute to development˝oriented goals, notwithstanding its limited mandate and resources. \\nIn the run˝up to the WHS, the UN Coordination of Humanitarian s \\n(OCHA) published a report arguing not only that peopy humanitarian cri\\n-ses are likely to end up ﬁle˚ behindﬂ from development gains but also speci˜cally calling \\non humanitarians to ﬁcontribute to the visionﬂ of the SDGs, arguing that ﬁmeeting basic \\nneeds in crisis will remain critical, but it is no longer enoughﬂ (OCHA,). \\n2021Introduction\\nto ﬁprioritization and assessment of capacities and accessﬂ of international humanitarian \\norganizations (OCHA,). \\nIn terms of people actually reached with assistance, global ˜gures are not available, and \\ncountry ˜gures are imprecise but some indications about the magnitude of the people \\nbeing le˚ behind might be inferred from individual countries where data has been gath\\n-ered. Taking the illustrative list of countries indicated in Figure ˇ.˙ (derived from UN ˜g\\n-ures frluding operations of the International Red Cross and Red \\nCrescent Movement and some other organizations), there is a huge range in targeting: \\nfrom ˙% of people identi˜ed in need in South Sudan to less than half of people in need \\nin Afghanistan. Similarly, in terms of the proportions reached, therence \\nbetween countries Œ fraine. In the latter case, it \\nis no coincidence that the donor response to the humanitarian appeal is also very\\n low.\\nPeople left out of sight, out of reach, out of the loop, out of money and out of\\n scope Even these rough ˜gures, however, may understate the numbers of people in need. As \\ndescribed in Chapter ˙, some people are ‚out of sight™ for the humanitarian sector. This \\nchapter focuses on the ‚hidden people™ who lack the basic documentation needed to qual\\n-ify for assistance; the ‚hidden problem™ of under˝reported sexual and gender based vio\\n-lence, and the ‚hidden places™ where cre\\n unmapped. \\nEven if humanitarians are aware of people in need, they are sometimes ‚out of reach™, as \\ndescribed in  In many cases, disasters or con˛icts themselves arti˜cially create \\nremoteness, by destroying airports, seaports or roads Œ or by rendering the areas where \\npeople live too risky to approach. But disasters and crle far from \\nconvenient urban centres, whether in mountain villages or isolated islands. Insecurity, \\nbureaucratic impediments and sometimes donor laws and policies can further hamper \\nthe ability of humanitarians to reach people in need, and for people in need to reach the \\nassistance they\\n need.\\nMoving one step closer in the concentric circles in Figure ˇ.ˇ are people who are ‚le˚ out \\nof the loop™; people both ‚in sight™ and ‚in reach™ but who still cannot make use of human\\n-itarian assistance because of the wayed. While there are many exam\\n-ples, o such populations most o˚en cited by National Red Cross \\nand Red Crescent Societies Œ older people and persons with disabilities. These groups \\nrepresent large and growing proportions of the population in cr \\nresearch shows the disproportionate impact that crises can have on them as well as their \\nrepeated marginalization in responses to emergencies. The chapter examines the barri\\n-ers older people and persons with disabilities face and highlights existing good practice \\nto ensure that typically marginalized groups are able to fully participate in, contribute to \\nand bene˜t from inclusive humanitarian\\n action.While the problems identi˜ed in these three chapters may never be perfectly addressed, \\nthey could be greatly reduced. Doing so would require greater attention to the blind spots \\nin the mechanics of humanitarian action, beginning with humanitarians™ approach to assess\\n-ing needs and identifying the people most in need and most vulnerable. If humanitarians \\nPeople left behind by the humanitarian\\n sector\\nAs suggested by Pictet, the question of whether short˝term humanitarianism impermissi\\n-bly leaves people with long˝term needs behind may need more philosophy than analysis \\nto answer. However, even looking only within more traditional con˜nes of the expected \\ncoverage of humanitarian action, it may still be asked if people are being le˚ behind, and \\nif the people furthest behind can proactively be reached ˜rst. This report focuses its anal\\n-ysis in this more limited\\n space.Fig. 1.1\\n  \\nHumanitarian population ‚onion™\\n modelSource: Based on (ACAPS\\n 2015b)Drawing on the humanitarian population ‚onion™ model (Figure ˇ.ˇ), the report focuses on \\npeopy a disaster or crisis and therefore needing assistance. Those le˚ behind \\nin this schema may include people who are not targeted for assistance, people who are \\ntargeted but not reached, and people who are reached but not really assisted (ACAPS \\ncited in ALNAP, ˙ˆˇ˘a). Obviously,, but there are also numer\\n-ous examples of systemic\\n gaps. \\nMany people who need humanitarian assistance are not even targeted for support. Precise \\n˜gures remain elusive (measuring need is an inexact art),OCHA predicted \\nthat some million people would require humanitarian assistance worldwide but indi\\n-cated that (regardless of the ˜nancing that might be made available) onlymillion \\nwould be targeted for international aid,OCHA,). the gap was \\neven larger, million people expected to require assistance and \\nmillion people actually to be targeted (OCHA,).

Filling \\nin missing poverty data, mapping missing communities, reaching communities in distant \\nplaces and ensuring the expertise and approaches necessary to address communities who \\nare ‚le˚ out of the loop™ all require investment. Directing investments requires tr\\nabout whose needs to prioritize with limited resources. The Principles of Impartiality and \\nHumanity can guide but cannot de˜nitively resolve the daily dilemmas of triage between \\nand within crises.\\nChapter ˘ therefore addresses this fundamental resourcing issue Œ the ‚out˝of˝money™ \\nproblem. The ˜nancing gap between humanitarian needs and funding is not new, but it \\ndoes appear to be growing. Limited resources lead both to deliberate and unconscious \\nchoices about where, how and for whom ˜nite funding is spent Œ and who is le˚ behind. \\nThe chapter focuses on three types of crises that o˚en experience underfunding Œ small \\nrapid˝onset disasters, larger slow˝onset disasters and long˝term complex emergencies. It \\nexplores how, in a world where resources will always be stretched, crises can be ˜nanced \\nently Œ to mitigate inequities of distribution and to diminish the need for interna\\n-tional humanitarian\\n action.es on a ˜nal question Œ whether certain crises are ‚out of scope™ for the \\nhumanitarian sector merely because they do not ˜t mainstream expectations for human\\n-itarian action. This chapter focuses on two such crises most frequently cited by National \\nSocieties: the plight of irregular migrants and peoping extreme urban violence. In \\nboth cases, people receive very limited protection from their own or other gov\\n-ernments and are experiencing at the scale and severity of a humanitarian cri\\n-sis. These situations raise the question of whether the humanitarian sector is governed \\nmore by habit and tradition than by principled analysis, and whether it can adapt to the \\nchanging realities of human\\n ing. \\nDisaster trends and\\n insights\\nom the thematic analysis of the previous chapters to review data and \\ntrends on disasters around the world and share insights from the IFRC on recent inno\\n-vations in disaster risk\\n management. \\nThis chapter ˜rst provides an integrated analysis of the frequency of various disaster types, \\ntheir geographical locations and their impacts, comparing them with trends in the IFRC™s \\nown international deployments, appeals and programming over the last ten years.

People are seen and \\ndeemed eligible because, among other things, their births are registered, they have proof \\nof identity, they are acknowledged and accepted by key institutions, their geographic loca\\n-tion is known and understood, and the extent and severity of the problems they face in \\ncrisis situations are recognized. Without these things, places, people and the problems \\nthey face are e˜ectively ‚out of sight™ for humanitarian\\n response.\\nThere are hidden people and groups in every community. In some cases, people are inad\\n-vertently out of sight, because of where or how they live and their access or otherwise to \\ninformation. Others live in the margins of society, for example some irregular migrants \\nwho fear detection and the possibility of forced return or other sanctions. There are also \\nmany examples of people and areas that are deliberately and strategically neglected or \\nmarginalized for political or economic reasons, or because they are stigmatized in\\n society.\\nEnsuring the most vulnerable people to the impact of crises are in sight and appropri\\n-ately supported is linked to who is doing the seeing and recording. Local people and local \\norganizations rooted in the communities they serve are o˝en best placed to know who is \\nhidden, what problems they face and how they can be overcome. The sta˙ng of the insti\\n-tutions and organizations operating in humanitarian contexts Œ local, national and inter\\n-national Œ and the extent to which they themselves are genuinely inclusive and free from \\ndiscrimination, can also have a direct impact on the visibility of vulnerable groups and \\nthe likelihood of them receiving\\n assistance.\\nBaseline data and analysis derived from humanitarian needs assessments should high\\n-light who is most in need, where they are and the priority areas of intervention. However, \\nmany millions of people are missing from the baseline data used to inform decisionˆmak\\n-ing.

A lack of identity papers \\ncreates challenges for people seeking to obtain even the most basic humanitarian assis\\n-tance. Governments, private sector organizations and national and international human\\n-itarian organizations o˝en require proof of identi˛cation as a prerequisite for registration \\nand eligibility to receive assistance. This is necessary in many cases to verify and authen\\n-ticate the recipients of humanitarian assistance and prevent duplication or fraud. At the \\nsame time, however, it can exclude large numbers of vulnerable people from accessing \\nmuch needed assistance, constrain their freedom of movement and expose them to addi\\n-tional protection\\n risks. \\n˜˚˜˚˜ How prevalent is the\\n problem?\\nThere are various forms of documentation that enable citizens to e˜ectively engage in \\ntoday™s world. They include basic identity papers, educational certi˛cates and proof of \\nland ownership or tenure. Without them, people are at risk of being le˝ behind Œ excluded \\nand denied basic opportunities, rights, access to services and humanitarian aid, and the \\nability to share in progress (World Bank Group and CGD,\\nIdentity papers are the most basic form of documentation and are vital in allowing some\\n-one to prove who they are and access a whole range of services.

They include actions to adopt more ˜exible proof-of-\\nidentity and know-your-customer requirements in emergency contexts, allow refu\\n-gees to use their UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)-issued identi˚cation \\nto open mobile money accounts, and explore new digital identity technologies (GSMA, \\n2018b). GSMA and UNHCR are also embarking on joint research to better understand \\nthe barriers to accessing mobile services in refugee contexts and formulate practi\\n-cal policy recommendations to overcome\\n them.What are the potential\\n solutions? There are various approaches to overcoming the problem of lack of identi˛cation. Many \\ngovernments, together with humanitarian organizations and private sector partners, are \\ntaking steps to increase access to humanitarian assistance, including for people without \\nidenti˛cation, while simultaneously enhancing transparency and accountability. UNHCR™s \\nnew Population Registration and Identity Management EcoSystem (PRIMES), for example, \\nuses biometrics to provide digital identities for displaced people and aims to be interop\\n-erable with systems used by governments and other partners. As well as solving the proof \\nof identity problem, it may also act as an enabler for broader digital inclusion in the con\\n-text of forced displacement and statelessness (UNHCR, \\nOther e˜orts include national programmes to increase identi˛cation coverage, improve \\ncivil registries and enhance integrated population databases (World Bank and CGD, \\nNew technologies provide opportunities for digital identi˛cation that go beyond paper-\\nbased systems, such as cloud computing, biometrics and smartcards (ibid; UNHCR,). \\nAs with all e˜orts to improve identi˛cation and greater digital inclusion, however, there \\nare risks as well as opportunities. This is particularly so where rigorous data protection \\nregulations and practices are lacking Œ putting vulnerable groups at even greater risk of \\nharm Œ and where e˜orts to improve identi˛cation systems deliberately or inadvertently \\nexclude alreadyˆmarginalized groups (World Bank and CGD, the Engine Room and \\nOxfam,\\nBlockchain technology Œ the use of a secured distributed ledger Œ has been piloted by \\nhumanitarian organizations in several settings to increase the e˜ectiveness of cash trans\\n-fer programming.

There are also advantages for host governments and humanitarian organi\\n-zations, including the enhanced ability to communicate with and assist the popula\\n-tion affected by the\\n emergency.\\nAlthough widespread, access to mobile services is still far from universal. Barriers \\nsuch as affordability and low levels of digital literacy continue to prevent access for \\nmany people.

National Societies in the \\ncountries covered by the project are working with government authorities and shel\\n-ter cluster partners to share lessons learned from the project to pre-identify par\\n-ticularly vulnerable groups who may be at risk of exclusion from assistance due to \\nlack of tenure or a lack of understanding of their rights. The work has also been put \\nto the test in the case of actual disaster response situations. In Tonga, for example, \\nfollowing Tropical Cyclone Gita in February 2018, the factsheets were used as part of \\nthe vulnerability analysis guidance shared by the local Shelter Cluster to help part\\n-ners prioritize the most vulnerable groups in affected communities and identify the \\npeople potentially at risk of being left behind in shelter\\n responses.\\nWhat are the potential\\n solutions?

In May 2018, a pilot project was conducted in Isiolo County using tools \\ndeveloped by the private-sector partner RedRose.

The questions asked by those responding to the emergency, and the \\nway those questions are asked, can lead to particular issues being overlooked or underes\\n-timated in emergency contexts. This particularly relates to sensitive topics, such as sexual \\nand genderˆbased violence (SGBV), and the various forms of abuse that fall under this, \\nincluding (but not limited to) sexual violence, domestic violence, tra˙cking, forced or early \\nmarriage, forced prostitution, and sexual exploitation and abuse (ICRC and IFRC, \\nThis includes sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers and other actors \\ncharged with protecting and assisting people a˜ected by crisis. While this area has come \\nunder scrutiny recently following scandals in the sector and the #MeToo campaign, much \\nmore needs to be done to protect vulnerable populations and prevent further abuses of \\nauthority (see inter alia IASC, \\nAt the level of international discourse, particularly around human rights and in the inter\\n-national humanitarian sector, SGBV cannot be entirely characterized as a hidden prob\\n-lem.

However, those sites catered to family groups and \\npeople identifying with a third gender were largely excluded. Even accessing toi\\n-lets was dif˚cult for the same reason (Froberg, 2015). Ultimately, this lack of dedi\\n-cated space made it dif˚cult for transgender people to access adequate assistance \\nand left them vulnerable to increased risk of\\n SGBV.\\nThe Blue Diamond Society improves the sexual health, human rights and well-be\\n-ing of sexual and gender minorities in Nepal. In the aftermath of the earthquake, it \\nestablished an emergency shelter for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender peo\\n-ple to seek refuge in a relatively safe and secure environment. The Nepal Red Cross \\nSociety also contributed by providing tarpaulins, blankets and oral rehydration solu\\n-tions to be used at the shelter and distributed to other Blue Diamond members.

Initially \\nthe project was designed to focus on incidences of sexual violence against women. \\nHowever, the taboo of talking about rape and sexual violence in South Sudan means \\nthat many survivors do not report crimes or seek help afterwards. The South Sudan \\nRed Cross has therefore adjusted the outward focus of its work to domestic violence \\nand broader economic empowerment for\\n women. \\nThe initiatives on domestic violence and women™s livelihoods are valid in and of them\\n-selves. Domestic violence by intimate partners is accepted as a part of daily life in \\nSouth Sudan; and a lack of economic alternatives in a heavily male-dominated soci\\n-ety means that women and girls often have no choice but to remain in abusive rela\\n-tionships (WhatWorks to Prevent Violence, 2015). The services provided by the South \\nSudan Red Cross, therefore, provide vital opportunities for women and girls to seek \\nimmediate help and build their own resilience to economic shocks, potentially reduc\\n-ing their exposure to different forms of violence. The relationships established and \\nsustained throughout the project also allow issues of sexual violence to be covered in \\na less overt, more culturally sensitive manner Œ creating an environment in which all \\nstakeholders, including men, are able to talk about and engage in the ˚ght to end\\n SGBV.\\nThe ˚rst step in overcoming the taboos surrounding SGBV is working with South \\nSudan Red Cross staff and volunteers. The project therefore includes comprehen\\n-sive awareness-raising and training for staff and volunteers of the South Sudan Red \\nCross on discriminatory cultural norms and practices that can lead to incidents of \\nSGBV and inhibit survivors from coming\\n forward.\\nUnderestimating sexual and gender-based violence prevalence in disaster\\n settings\\nWhile the risk and impact of SGBV is increasingly under its \\npervasiveness in disasters caused by natural hazards is less well appreciated.

This was evidenced when thousands of small () \\norganizations endeavoured to support the response to the ˛˝˜˝ Haiti Earthquake, and \\nin the inundation of inappropriate material to Vanuatu following Tropical Cyclone Pam \\n(see Box ˘.˙).\\nThis issue of security capacities and insurance raises a fundamental question of ethical, \\nif not legal, duty of care that needs to be addressed (OCHA, ˛˝˜˜b). Investment in the \\nhuman resources and capacities, systems, hardware and infrastructure and insurance for \\nlocal and national partners and national staˆ is\\n essential.\\nNegotiations and compromises in achieving principled\\n assistance\\nAchieving truly impartial provision of aid based solely on need is extremely di˚cult in \\nareas where access is limited due to insecurity (Haver, ˛˝˜˙, Haver and Carter, ˛˝˜˙). \\nIndeed, ﬁhumanitarian princip with the reality of crisis situations and \\nrequire tradeˇoˆs in their useﬂ (Bennett et al ˛˝˜˙a). This is particularly the case where \\nthere arverage, as noted earlier (Stoddard and Jillani, ˛˝˜˙), \\nand where it is only possible to provide assistance in certain communities and not oth\\n-ers. Hence the key questions become what type of compromises are organizations will\\n-ing to make and where are their red lines? (Svoboda et al,\\nThere is increased investment in training and professionalization for access negotia\\n-tions, with organizations developing guidelines and protocols. For example, the Centre \\nof Competence on Humanitarian Negotiations provides training to various humanitarian \\nactors. While training and specialized skills are useful, negotiating acces\\n-stant part of action at the most local level and therefore involves many more staˆ than \\nthere are trained experts. Similarly, while joint initiatives can be ial, most organi\\n-zations insist on the importance of ﬁdirect bilateral contactﬂ (Haver, ˛˝˜˙).\\nAccess negotiations and initiatives can happen at many levels, including bilaterally with \\ngoveres in armed groups, and through the UN Security Council, \\nsuch as its resoy cessation of hostilities in Syria to \\nenable deliveries of humanitarian assistance and medical evacuations of the critically sick \\nand wounded. Security Council resolutions are not required for access, given clear obliga\\n-tions under international humanitarian law, but can in theory be a useful tool. However, \\neven where there is higherˇlevel permission, experience shows that without local compli\\n-ance this will not enable\\n access.\\nOrganizations present in hardˇtoˇreach areas are painfully aware of the compromises \\nneeded to stay and deliver assistance and will make deliberate choices that may compro\\n-mise certain principles in support of the overarching principle of humanity (although they \\nmay not always do this well or based on a sound analysis of the implications and trade-\\noˆs) (Niland, \\nThese issues are challenging for both international and local actors: ﬁEssentially, par\\n- hold the upper hand in deciding, indeed dictating, the rules that \\nwill apply to humanitarian access, the consequences of which will have similar eˆects on \\norganizations regardless of their provenanceﬂ (Svoboda et al, ˛˝˜˙). However, local organ\\n-izations have diˆerent strategies to address these challenges (ibid). Tactics may include \\nadding programme areas at the request of diˆerent groups to maintain access to the areas \\nwith highest need, or otherwise meeting demands so long as they are also able to con\\n-Haver and Carter, ˛˝˜˙). Working with a diverse range of \\nlocal actors with presence at the community level may help in some situations to ensure \\nbroader geographical\\n presence.\\n7475Out of reach: remote and hard-to-access populations\\nDonor programming and contractual\\n requirements \\nEspecially in the wake of recent scandals, donors are focusing increasingly on human\\n-itarian organizations™ accountability, in particular their measures to prevent fraud, cor\\n-ruption, sexual exploitation and abuse. As donor requirements become increasingly spe\\n-cic, expensive and elaborate, small local organizations oen struggle to keep pace. Their \\ndi˚culties in quickly meeting the standards designed for large Western bureaucracies \\nreduce the range of partners with which donors and intermediary organizations can part\\n-ner. This can prove a problem in locations where there are already very few organizations \\npresent and it may therefore not be possibincipled experienced partners who \\ncan undertake the\\n work.\\nSome INGOs have raised concerns that donors are increasingly transferring risk to them \\nrather than sharing the risks (Stoddard et al, ˛˝˜˙b), including the risks of working with \\nnew partners. For example, some donors require monitoring of programme implementa\\n-tion (y local partners) by international staˆ, even in situations where this is contrary \\nto security rules and programmes have been cancelled or closed for this reason. Donor \\necognize the challenges, but are at the same time unable or unwilling \\nto share the risks for nonˇcompliance as such decisions are taken elsewhere (ibid). \\nCriminalization of assistance and reducing humanitarian\\n spaceDeliberate limitations on humanitarian space are not restricted zones. This is \\nshown by the increased measures restricting provision of assistance to migrants, in par\\n-ticular in Europe.

These challenges \\nmay be exacerbated by humanitarian responders who do not coordinate with authorities, \\nmay be supply driven rather than needs driven and who do not always comply with (or \\nknow about) basic national law or humanitarian\\n standards. \\nAn IFRC survey examined some of the challenges impacting on international relief in the \\ncontext of disasters. The most common issues raised by survey respondents were about \\ncoordination, in particular between international and domestic responders, and among \\ndomestic agencies on how to manage international assistance. Survey participants cited \\nother frequent and highestˇimpact regulatory problems as: di˚culty in obtaining customs \\nclearance or exemptions from duties, taxes or costs; delays or restrictions in the entry of \\nrelief workers; di˚culty in accessing information on customs and other borderˇcrossing \\nprocedures; and failure of international responders to adequately consult with aˆected \\npeople about decisions (IFRC,). \\nBox 3.6\\n Vanuatu administrative challenges in disaster response and \\nthe need for clear processes and legal\\n frameworks\\nIn March 2015, Vanuatu was hit by one of the most intense cyclone in the Paci˜c™s \\nrecorded history Œ Tropical Cyclone Pam, affecting over half of the population, ˚at\\n-tening homes and schools and displacing some 65,000\\n people. \\nThe government issued its ˜rst-ever generalized appeal for international assistance, \\nand scores of international organizations, INGOs and bilateral partners ˚ooded into \\nthe country to support the response.

Of course, as noted already, \\nthis can be more challenging for smaller organizations and local actors with low cover\\n-age for overhead and core\\n costs. \\nCounter-terrorism laws and dealing with listed\\n groups\\nMany governments have adopted legislation and associated measures aimed at combat\\n-ting terrorial support to designated ‚terrorist™ \\nentities, and implemented sanctions regimes. The relevant prohibitions generally focus \\nial or material support to listed groups, extended even to include training on \\nhuman rights law, as noted in the ˛˝˜˝ US Supreme Court case Holder v Humanitarian \\nLaw Project. Paying ‚taxes™ and diverting assistance risks breaching these laws. It is even \\nmore challenging when the group in question is also de facto government of the area, \\nrunning schools and hospitals, such as in\\n Gaza. \\nSome donors have also implemented vetting requirements Œ for staˆ, partners and some\\n-times for aˆected people. These slow response and can undermine the impartiality and \\nperceived neutrality of humanitarian assistance, and further impact on security and access \\n(NRC,). Organizations that accept funding from donors with such requirements are \\nceived not to be neutral (Burinske and Modirzadeh, Some donors have \\nadvised grant recipients that they should not engage with members of designated groups, \\nand similar requirements are specws. Some humanitarians have \\ntherefore curtailed their direct contact with listed groups, severely hampering potential \\naccess negotiations and acceptance strategies (Mackintosh and Duplat, ˛˝˜˘; NRC,). \\nImpacts have ranged from substantial delays in initiating emergency operations (for exam\\n-ple, awaiting approval for programmes in highˇrisk areas, such as Syria, and long vetting \\nprocesses) to shutting particular programmes. For example US commodityˇbased sanc\\n-tions against the Syrian government substantially slowed importation into the country \\nof essential items that facilitate humanitarian assistance, as many need speclearance \\nfrom the US Bureau of Industry and Security (NRC,). \\nFears of inadvertent breach of such legal requirements have been reported to have a ﬁchill\\n-ing eˆectﬂ, discouraging programming in areas under the control of listed groups (Burinske \\nand Modirzadeh,kintosh and Duplat, ˛˝˜˘; Haver, ˛˝˜˙). Some humanitarian \\norganizations have adopted ﬁselfˇimposed limitations on where they operate– to pre\\n-vent any potential violations of counterˇterrorism lawsﬂ (Svoboda and Haddad, ˛˝˜). The \\neˆects of these regulations have been felt on operations in Afghanistan, Mali, Somalia, \\nIraq, Syria and occupied Palestinian territory, among others (Jackson and Zyck, The \\npotential impact of this if su˚ciently widespread, is that communities living in areas con\\n-trolled by listed groups will not have access to the assistance that they need (NRC,).\\nBank de-risking Use of banking systems is particularly challenging in contexts with listed terrorist groups. \\nInternational banks have blocked or delayed fund transfers or closed accounts from inter\\n-national humanitarian organizations, impacting on humanitarian relief operations.

If anything, the manˇmade barriers, ranging from deliberate violence \\nagainst aid workers, to inadequate investment in infrastructure in marginalized and impov\\n-erished communities, to restrictive regulatory environments, can be even more challeng\\n-ing to address. These challenges arwider political failings Œ from \\nesolution, to restrictions on civil society space, to inadequate investment \\nin infrastructure in marginalized and impoverished\\n communities. \\nWhile bringing everyone within reach and removing such obstacles entirely may not be \\npossible without political solutions to build peace and social inclusion, humanitarian \\norganizations and donors can take some practical steps towards improving access. These \\ninclude: investing in local capacities; addressing administrative barriers; removing donor \\ndisincentives and barriers to working in hardˇtoˇreach areas; and prioritizing and incen\\n-tivizing improved coverage in hardestˇtoˇreach\\n communities.Many concerted and creative eˆorts are underway and guidelines and agreements exist. \\nStates and components of the ICRC agreed in ˛˝˜˜ to ﬁremove administrative barriers to \\nthe rapid delivery of humanitarian assistance for victims of ar including \\nthrough enacting domestic legislation (ICRC, ˛˝˜˜b).

Initiatives that support presence in di˚cult environments \\nŒ such as investing in security management, transport, communications and visibility \\ncapabilities and staˆ insurance Œ should be considered core to project budgets, not \\ndispensable overheads, and funded\\n ly.\\nReporting frameworks should also not disincentivize or penalize attempts to access \\nhardˇtoˇreach populations Œ recognizing, for example, that fewer people may be reached \\nper dollar in such contexts and adopting realistic and adaptable performance\\n indicators.\\nAt the same time, humanitarian organizations need to be more vocal and \\nstraightforward about the impacts of donor laws and policies and more forthcoming in \\nworking together to develop solutions that meet donors™ underlying\\n concerns.\\nHarmonized requirements across donors can help make this task much easier. Some \\nInterˇAgency Standing Committee members have therefore proposed that donors adopt \\n(or adapt collectively) common policies around integrity and accountability issues, rather \\nthan each developing their own policy requirements. An example is provisions on pre\\n-vention of sexual exploitation and abuse outlined in the Core Humanitarian\\n Standard.\\nThere are also initiatives to mitigate blockages around sharing risk across the levels of \\nthe humanitaring chain.

This means \\nmapping the capacities that exist, investing early in sustainable local capacities and \\nproviding better support to national partners with a local presence before crises hit. \\nLocal responders, like all humanitarians, can and should be expected to have adequate \\nsafeguarding and accountability procedures in place, but these requirements should \\nbe realistic and calibrated to real (as opposed to perceived) risks. Supporting local \\norganizations to be able to meet donor requirements, and where possible to be pre-\\napproved as partners, also means they can receive funding and scale up much more \\nquickly in a\\n crisis.\\n ŠInternational organizations should see their responsibilities as extending beyond \\ntheir own sta˙ to their local and national partners. \\nThis requires investment in \\nary local partners including specialist negotiation training; security \\nmanagement; the implementation of security systems and procedures; transport, \\ncommunications and visibility equipment; and staˆ insurance.

It states ﬁpersons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, \\npsychosocial, intellectual or sensory impairments, which in interaction with various \\nbarriers may hinder their full and effective participation in, and access to, human\\n-itarian programmesﬂ.

To illustrate some of the barriers to inclusive humanitarian action, as \\nwell as e˚orts underway to overcome them, this chapter looks in particular at two groups \\nof people who are frequently leˆ out of the loop during crisis planning, response and \\nrecovery: older people and persons with disabilities. These two groups represent a large \\nand growing proportion of the population in cresearch high\\n-lights the disproportionate impact that crises can have on them; as well as their repeated \\nmarginalization in responses to\\n emergencies.\\nCovering the two groups together does not infer that they are one and the same how\\n-ever. While there is some overlap between the two, they are also distinct in various ways. \\nNeither are they in themselves homogenous categories Œ as well as individual and con\\n-textual di˚erences, there are di˚erent types and severities of disability for example, and \\nsigni˜cant di˚erences betwoups within the ov\\n population. \\nWhile focusing on older people and persons with disabilities for the purposes of illus\\n-tration, this chapter seeks to draw broader conclusions about what progress, if any, has \\nbeen made in terms of furthering access to aid for people leˆ out of the loop. It examines \\nwhether the barriers to making humanitarian response more inclusive to people with par\\n-ticular needs remain, and what good practice there is to ensure that typically marginal\\n-ized groups are able to fully participate in and bene˜t from inclusive humanitarian\\n action. \\n˜˚˛ How are older people and persons with disabilities affected by\\n disasters? \\nOlder people and persons with disabilities are not inherently vulnerable to disasters. In \\nboth categories there are a range of levels of vulnerability as well as capabilities. Indeed, \\nthere is considerable evidence of older people and persons with disabilities acting as an \\nimportant resource for their families and communities, particularly during times of crisis \\n(IFRC,,ells,illiams, There are, however, factors asso\\n-ciated with ageing and disability that can increase vulnerability to the impact of disasters \\nand other crises. Reduced mobility, diminished employment opportunities, chronic health \\nconditions, discrimination and other factors may put older people and persons with dis\\n-abilities more at risk during times of\\n crisis.\\nBox 4.1\\n De˜nitionsThe UN de˜nes an older person as someone above 60 years of age; and ‚oldest-old™ \\ngenerally refers to people over 80 (Wells, 2005).

Vulnerability \\nin emergencies can come from the combination of age or disability with other factors, \\nsuch as gender, ethnicity or social exclusion. Poverty is a key factor in determining vul\\n-nerability to the impact of crises. Research indicates that older people and persons with \\ndisabilities are more likely than their younger and led peers to experience pov\\n-erty. This can be due to their particular needs, for example healthcare needs and expenses \\n(HelpAge International,  as well as barriers in their environment that prevent them \\nfrom accessing key services and opportunities, such as education, healthcare, employ\\n-ment, justice and social support (DFID,Age International and Handicap \\nInternational,ohwerder, This reinforces and increases the vulnerability of \\nolder people and persons with disabilities during times of crisis, leaving them with fewer \\nresources to withstand and recover from shocks and pushing them further into poverty. \\nIn Bangladesh, the data shows a correlation between poverty and disability in a context \\nof high vulnerability to natural hazards, including ˙oods, tropical cyclones, storm surges \\nand droughts.

This traditional lifestyle has begun to \\nchange, however, with increasing migration to urban areas, leaving many older peo\\n-ple who stay behind to take care of livestock separated from traditional support sys\\n-tems and isolated from family\\n members. \\nMongolia experiences frequent \\ndzuds Œ a phenomenon whereby extreme tempera\\n-tures in both summer and winter leave many animals short of food and expose herd\\n-ers to food shortages, lack of fuel and deterioration of their health. An extreme dzud \\nin the winter of 2016/2017 affected many herders. This included a signi˜cant propor\\n-tion of older people who had become isolated due to younger members of the family \\nmoving to urban areas in search of work. Losses of livestock led to intense stress for \\nmany people as well as feelings of shame and failure. Ultimately, the disaster is esti\\n-mated to have affected around 225,000 people and killed over one million\\n animals.\\nThe humanitarian response to the \\ndzud, both from national and international institu\\n-tions and organizations, largely focused on providing food, fuel, fodder and veterinary \\nmedications. Few organizations focused on the particular needs of older people and \\npersons with disabilities. The Mongolian Red Cross through its Social Inclusion and \\nDevelopment Programme did, however, explicitly identify older people and persons \\nwith disabilities as vulnerable groups in need of speci˜cally tailored support. Their \\nassistance included helping people to carry out household chores, access state ben\\n-e˜ts and arrange medical visits continue healthcare for chronic illness and\\n disease. \\nSocial contact to respond to feelings of isolation was also a strong element of the \\nMongolian Red Cross response. It took various forms, including reading to older peo\\n-ple and persons with disabilities, informing them of news from outside, and offering \\nsomeone to talk to and a source of advice and comfort during the crisis. This ena\\n-bled people who may otherwise have been excluded from the response to bene˜t \\nŒ not only by receiving physical assistance, but also in countering feelings of lone\\n-liness and the negative impact of social\\n exclusion.\\nThe disproportionate impact of crises on older people and persons with disabilities can \\nbe caused by various factors, including limited mobility, dependence on family and com\\n-munity members, stigmatization and inaccessibility of early warning messaging and evac\\n-uation facilities. Disasters and con˙icts can also increase the number of people living \\nwith disabilities, due to new injuries as well as deterioration of existing conditions. For \\npeople with both new and existing disabilities, the negative impact of disasters may be \\ncompounded by loss or damage to assistive devices in the midst of an emergency, limited \\nCrises can have a disproportionate impact on older people and persons with disabili\\n-ties. A study by the O˝ce of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rig\\ndata from Japan to suggest that persons with disabilities are four times more likely to die \\nwhen a disaster strikes (OHCHR, In Vanuatu, research indicates that persons with \\ndisabilities were more than twice as likely to have been injured during Tropical Cyclone \\nPCBM, \\nIn the Philipp people ovepresented approximately\\n-tion,y Typhoon Haiyan that same year \\n(see Figure Similarly in Nepal,ˇ% of people who died in the earthquake in  \\nwere aged ov yet older people represented only\\n population.Limited mobility, making it di˝cult to ˙ee, is likely to be the primary reason for the dis\\n-proportionate impact of crises on older people and persons with disabilities. However, \\nthere are other reasons speci˜c to each context that help to explain the data. In some cases, \\npeople may have nowhere to go and prefer to stay close to home despite the risks. Others \\nmay underestimate the impact of crises based on their previous experiences. Research also \\nsuggests that older persons with disabilities disproportionately experience poor housing \\nconditions (HelpAge International, which may put these people more at risk in the \\nevent of disasters caused by natural\\n hazards. \\nFig. 4.4\\n Age breakdown of people affected by disasters in the Philippines and\\n Nepal   ˚Œ˘˝Source: Based on UNDESA Population Division and HelpAge International (2016,\\n 2013)Beyond fatalities, disasters can and do impact on older people and persons with disabili\\n-ties in particular ways.

The maternal mortality ratio for Afghan women is among the highest in the \\nworld. Cultural norms in Afghanistan dictate that a woman must be seen by a female \\nhealth professional, and women cannot travel alone to seek medical attention with\\n-out an accompanying male family member. As a result, home births are still the norm \\nwith 86% of deliveries taking place at\\n home. \\nThe Afghan Red Crescent Society runs specially designed community-based health \\nprogrammes (CBHP) across Afghanistan. These bring critical healthcare to vulnerable \\ncommunities by providing services, health awareness and promotion, improved access \\nto safe drinking water and improved sanitation facilities, and more diverse\\n foods. \\nThe CBHP has adopted an innovative way of convincing pregnant women Œ and their \\nhusbands, fathers and other male relatives Œ to seek health services and undergo \\nmedical treatment in the nearest health facility. Grandmothers are often considered \\nas in˚uential ˜gures not only in their own families, but also in wider rural communi\\n-ties. Therefore, local committees of grandmothers were formed and trained to play \\na key role in advocating for women (and particularly pregnant women) to seek bet\\n-ter healthcare and for men in the community to support and enable them to do\\n so. \\nThe CBHP in Balkh set up ten committees in 2016 with a membership of around 200 \\nwomen. An evaluation of the project in 2017 found that the grandmothers™ commit\\n-tees had a strong positive effect on raising awareness of improved maternal health \\npractices. During the CBHP, there was a signi˜cant increase in deliveries attended \\nby a skilled health worker: in pilot areas, from 4% in 2008 to 25% in 2010; and in all \\nproject areas from 30% in 2008 to 66% by 2016. The improvements cannot be attrib\\n-uted solely to the grandmothers™ committees, but they are credited with making a \\nsigni˜cant contribution to changing mindsets and encouraging healthy\\n practices.\\nOverall, the project succeeded in identifying and harnessing the unique capabili\\n-ties of older people Œ and older women in particular Œ as volunteers in their com\\n-munities, and did so in a creative and digni˜ed way to bring about positive change. \\nThe wider implementation of integrating the Afghan Red Crescent Societies™ CBHP, \\nmobile health services and maternal, neonatal and child health clinical services all \\naim to widen service reach with holistic, curative, preventive and promotional health\\n-care to targeted vulnerable communities. Engaging communities in health service \\nimplementation and community acceptance aims to ensure safe access and assur\\n-ance of protection for staff and volunteers operating in insecure areas. Continuous \\nsupport to build the capacity of communities and volunteers leads to greater com\\n-munity resilience in coping with health and disaster\\n risks.\\nNot only do crisis risk management activities frequently ignore disability, but persons with \\ndisabilities and their caregivers are rarely given the chance to contribute to early warn\\n-ing systems and other disaster preparedneselated initiatives. There are examples, how\\n-ever, of people using their own insights on disability to make valuable contributions to \\nrisk reduction\\n e˚orts. \\naccess to healthcare and rehabilitation, psychological stress and anxiety, abandonment, \\nand a breakdown of support structures and preventative\\n healthcare. \\nCertain risk factors can contribute to the impact of disasters on people, many of them \\nrelated and overlapping. For example, disability combined with other factors can increase \\nlevels of risk and vulnerability.

The two groups are typically characterized as \\nhelpless or weak during times of crisis. Indeed, while some older people and persons with \\ndisabilities may face additional risks in the event of a disaster, they also oˆen have valu\\n-able contributions to make and are keen to regain control of their lives and stabilize the \\nlives of their families and wider\\n communities. \\nFor example, many older people, including persons with disabilities, take on additional \\nchildcare responsibilities in times of crisis Œ women in particular (Wells, Migration \\ncan make this the norm in some contexts, where younger people seek employment else\\n-where, leaving older people to take care of grandchildren.

Those respond\\n-ing to the emergency are thereaˆer less driven to design age- and disabopriate \\nprogrammes and services, and less accountable to do so if the needs of older people and \\npersons with disabilities remain largely\\n unknown.\\nWhere data on older people is gathered, the ovoup is oˆen treated as homog\\n-enous, failing to rences betw\\nyears,years and so on (HelpAge International and IDMC, \\nlimits in surveys also restrict comprehensive data gathering on the needs of older peo\\n-ple.

In Bang a rapsessment of older people forci\\n-bly displaced from Mylder people interviewed had respon\\n-sibilities to care for an average of dependants in the household (HelpAge International, \\n). This information challenged the assumption that older people are automatically \\ndependants in the family. In this instance it also helped to inform the design of pro\\n-grammes that not only provided appropriate support to older refugees, but worked with \\nolder people as conduits for ensuring adequate healthcare, protection and other essen\\n-tial services to children in the refugee\\n population. \\n9899Left out of the loop: older people and persons with disabilities\\nthe world today Œ just over half and rising Œ who have no access to pensions (UNDESA, \\n Moreover, many older people continue to act as key decers in their fam\\n-ilies and communities, particularly during times of crisis Œ something that is not oˆen \\nrecognized and capitalized on by people responding to\\n emergencies. \\nData from a survey conducted by Humanity & Inceveals startling levels \\nof exclusion from humanitarian assistance and services for persons with disabilities.

Further analysis showed that many older people had been \\nleft behind without carers when families had moved in search of pasture and clean \\nwater. This left them without access to services and at risk of malnutrition, particu\\n-larly people with mobility challenges who were unable to travel long\\n distances. \\nThe Kenya Red Cross Society worked through community health volunteers and dis\\n-abled person™s organizations (DPOs) in Turkana county to map and identify house\\n-holds with older people and persons with disabilities.

As a result, out of the just over 5,500 people reached, around 1,760 \\nwere classi˜ed as older people and 649 as persons with\\n disabilities. \\nThe experience in Turkana county was made possible thanks to a clear disability \\nand social inclusion policy, and a determined effort by the Kenya Red Cross Society \\nto gather and analyse sex, age and disability-disaggregated data using well-trained \\n.\\n The Charter was launched at the World Humanitarsed by a number of \\nstates, UN agencies, civil society organizations and networks.

For example, written communications \\nor SMS messages may not be suitable ways of communicating with older people with \\nhigh levels of illiteracy and/or minimal use of mobile phones.

As a consequence, older people, \\npersons with disabilities and other potentially vulnerable groups remain at risk of being \\nleˆ out of the loop, and leˆ behind by humanitarian\\n response.\\nMoreover, focusing on speci˜c aspects of people and groups separately Œ such as disabil\\n-ity, age or gender Œ fails to consider the multiple and interlinked vulnerabilities, needs \\nand capacities of people a˚ected by crises. Overcoming this mindset is further entrenched \\nby the architecture of the humanitarian sector that navigates by sector (e.g. health) or by \\nentire population groups (e.g. refugees).

This includes not only \\ndata collection and analysis but also overcoming the continued risks and resistance \\nto greater \\nsharing\\n of data. Lack of data is not the only reason why older people and \\npersons with disabilities are frequently excluded from humanitarian action Œ but it is \\na clear contributing factor. People need to be visible and counted for humanitarians to \\nunderstand their situations and be held accountable for responding appropriately to \\ntheir needs and capacities. \\n ŠData is particularly lacking on persons with disabilities, and the granularity of both age- \\nand disabelated data falls short. For example, distinguishing between di˚erent \\nage groups within the broader heading of ‚old age™, and identifying di˚erent types \\nand severity of disability, as well as upper age limits on humanitarian assessments and \\nsurveys which thereaˆer exclude older people from participating in certain initiatives, \\nincluding livelihood\\n programmes.\\n ŠLanguage and literacy levels of everyone\\n in need should be systematically and \\nroutinely captured and questions on language and\\n communication needs should be incsessments\\n, as proposed byAgency Standing \\nCommittee (IASC) Task Team on Accountability to A˚ected People and Protection \\nfrom Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, and Translators without Borders, in early \\nFactoring language and other potential barriers to communication into the design and \\nresourcing of participation and accountability mechanisms will help ensure minority \\nlanguage speakers and less literate people are not excluded. Gender is oˆen a key factor \\nin˙uencing language and literacy skills and should not be\\n forgotten.\\nThe information gathered on unmet needs of persons with disabilities and older \\npeople was also used to advocate for a more inclusive response by other humani\\n-tarian agencies at national level. Team members worked closely with mainstream \\nhumanitarian organizations to sensitize them on disability issues and equip them \\nwith simple tools and approaches to include persons with disability and older peo\\n-ple in their programmes. \\nOne of the main lessons from the ageing and disability focal points initiative is to \\ninvolve persons with disabilities and older people in emergency preparedness ini\\n-tiatives. This can ensure that mainstream humanitarian agencies already have the \\nknowledge and mechanisms to reach these groups when disasters strike, and per\\n-sons with disabilities and older people, as well as their representative organiza\\n-tions, are equipped with the necessary capacity to actively engage in the response \\neffort from the\\n outset.\\nFinding a way to bridge the gap Œ ensuring that mainstream humanitarian organizations \\nare age and disability competent on the one hand, and local disab \\nagencies are adequately resourced and supported to inform and guide the response on \\nthe other Œ will mean departing from currently accepted norms in the humanitarian sec\\n-tor. And, as others have already articulated, it likely necessitates a radical overhaul of the \\ninstitutions, the power dynamics between them, the way that success is articulated and \\nmeasured, and the ˙ow of resources to and between responding organizations (ODI, \\nALNAP,elopment Initiatives,).\\n˜˚ˇ In the loop: conclusions and recommendationsSome progress has been made on including older people and persons with disabilities \\nin humanitarian response. The SDGs have been key in moving the development agenda \\nforward to leave no one behind, and the humanitarian community continues to look for \\nways to respond to people most in need. A proliferation of guidance, standards and tool\\n-kits show that the commitment and the will are there; and, as this chapter has shown, \\nthere are many examples of good practice at global and country\\n levels. \\nThe discussion is now not \\nwhether to make humanitarian action more inclusive, but \\nhow\\n to make it more inclusive, and how to do so at scale. Humanitarian principles and good \\npractice should automatically lead to the people most at risk and these groups are clearly \\na priority focus for crisis prevention and response. The various frameworks, commitments \\nand standards that exist are adequate in terms of providing clarity and vision for better \\ninclusion within humanitarian response.

As other chapters show, there is o˜en an evidence \\ngap around the consequences of what humanitarian agencies \\ndo not do. If an agency is \\nunable to resource an operation, it will be unlikely to resource evaluating the full impact \\nof its absence on a˙ected people. Programmes tend to be evaluated ‚on their own terms™ \\nagainst their objectives, in other words in terms of what they delivered, rather than what \\nthey did not and ﬁas a result, the implications of underfunding Œ an issue of continuing \\nand growing signi˚cance Œ are poorly r (Darcy, Arguably, the humanitar\\n-ian sector is used to reporting on outputs but ill equipped to ﬁde˚ne outcomes clearly, \\nquantify and measure themﬂ. So, if understanding the outcomes of \\nfunded work is a chal\\n-lenge for the sector, understanding the consequences of \\nunfunded work is all the more\\n so. \\nThere is however, some reporting of what humanitarian agencies are unable to deliver \\nwhen funds are stretched, and some agencies and appeal reviews document the conse\\n-quences of underfunding for meeting target population numbers (see inter alia UNHCR, \\n). A review of funding by sector for the appeals also gives some indication of which \\nkinds of needs are deprioritized when funding is tight. Only food security, nutrition and \\nthe smaller mine action and coordination sectors have been consistently more than \\nfunded over the past three years. Early recovery and emergency shelter tend to be least \\nfunded (averaging less than a third funded) along with agriculture, education and\\n protection. \\nSector coverage varies between di˙erent underfunded contexts. For example, in \\nthe Democratic People™s Republic of Korea (DPRK), nutrition wwhile \\nhealth and food security were ˛ˆ% and ˛˛% respectively; in Haiti, food security w\\nfunded  Such percentages belie further variations in what each dol\\n-lar can buy Œ the costs of operations and food and non˝food items depend on many fac\\n-tors including markets, access and variations in agencies™ costing models.

Many donors have policy commitments to fund\\n-ing neglected emergencies (Dalrymple and Smith, most notably ECHO™s forgotten \\ncrisis commitments. Some seek to protect the impartiality of their allocation decisions \\nwith matrices informed by measures of risk, vulnerability and severity, as well as investing \\nin unearmarked, pooled funds to enable agencly respond to needs. As well as \\nbilateral funding to identi˚ed emergencies, other counterbalances have been built into \\nthe international humanitarian funding system to even up the ˚nancing picture.\\n UN agen\\n-cies, the IFRC and international non˝governmental organizations (INGOs) have all devel\\n-oped funds tailored to addressing underfunded or o˙-the˝radar\\n crises. \\nCritical as these are, they are short˝term contingency measures to ˚ll selected gaps, rather \\nthan a systemic rebalancing of the way that humanitarian crises are ˚nanced. A˜er all, allo\\n-cations from the IFRC™s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF), the INGO˝run Start \\nFund and the llar\\n-mal compared with the UN˝coorillion US dollars. This \\nsystemic rebalancing demands not just a di˙erent way of approaching humanitarian allo\\n-cations ‚ex˝post™ (a˜er a crisis happens) in response to needs, but a greater commitment \\nfrom others to invest ‚ex˝ante™ (before a crisis) in reducing risks and vulnerabilities. There \\nis a growing body of evidence and a growing toolkit of domestic, regional and interna\\n-tional ˚nancing that form part of the solution. This chapter examines how these do, and \\ncould, apply to avoid and address the out˝of˝money problem in three types of crisis: small \\nrapid˝onset, slow˝onset and chronic complex\\n emergencies. \\n˜˚˝ Off the radar, rapid\\n-onset crisesMajor rapid˝onset disasters tend to succeed at attracting signi˚cant international human\\n-itarian funding as the responses to the Indian Ocean tsunami, Nepal earthquake and \\nTyphoon Haiyan attest. There are exceptions and volume clearly does not equate to time\\n-liness and e˙ectiveness (Hanley et al, ˆˇ˛) But what of small˝scale disasters Œ which have \\nsevere impacts for a˙ected populations but do not trigger international appeals or gen\\n-erate major\\n headlines?Responses to these disasters may be out of money for multiple reasons Œ because they \\nare beyond the means or reach of domestic resources and because international funding \\nis too stretched,le or too slow to react. Poor timing is o˜en the critical prob\\n-lem, not only being too slow to respond to needs a˜er the event (ex˝post) as is the fre\\n-quent criticism of humanitarian funding, but also failing to adequately invest ahead of \\ntime (ex˝ante) to build resilience, reduce risk and prevent predictable impacts of o˜en \\npredictable\\n events.\\ninclude tensions between the principled approach of meeting the most severe needs and \\nthe utilitarian approach of reaching the most people as well as the following\\n factors:\\n ŠOut of the headlines: the level of international media pro˚le has a bearing on levels \\nof funding, providing a public incentive for action Œ the so˝called CNN e˙ect Œ an \\nunderstanding that drives advocacy and fundraising e˙orts. Over a decade ago the \\nWorld \\nDisasters Report\\n showed a close correlation between media exposure, appeal coverage and \\naid per person (IFRC, It is still a critical factor that drives the way appeals seek \\nmedia attention and is ry ECHO™s FCA (ECHO,gotten \\ncrisis indices (see for example NR) and CARE Inter\\nmeasures of below average media coverage in their\\n analyses. \\n ŠOut of favour: \\nmany donors choose a strategic set of countries to focus their sustained \\ninterventions and these are o˜en informed by historical ties, geopolitics and national \\ninterest, bureaucratic capacity as well as need (see inter alia Drummond et al,\\nDalrymple and Smith, Countries including DPRK and Ukraine may thus fall \\n‚out of favour™ outside these.\\n Proximity also plays a part Œ evident in funding from \\nEuropean donors to the European migration crisis (IFRC,), and the tendency \\nof Gulf donors to fund within the region (Development Initiatives,). Counter-\\nterrorism and security concerns can be both a motivation for directing increased aid \\nand a constraint in delivering it. The political relationship with the authorities of \\nthe crisis˝a˙ected country can also be key in creating an enabling environment for \\ntimely assistance,y trust and ties, and on the recipient \\ngovernment side, in declaring an emergency and calling for international assistance \\n(Bailey, ˆˇ˛ˆ). \\n ŠOut of information:\\n informed decision˝making needs current, comparable and \\ngranular information about risks and needs, analytical capacity to discern priorities, \\nand ˚nancial clarity to assess costs. Smaller donors with limited ˚eld presence and \\nanalytical capacity to generate, seek or process the available information may take their \\ncue from larger donors, causing a ﬁherdingﬂ e˙ect around certain crises (Binder et al, \\nˆˇ˛˘). Even for the larger donors, gaps in available assessments of need, and a lack of \\ntrust in the stated requirements (Darcy et al, ˆˇ˛˘) can deter funding allocations and \\nperpetuate preferential funding pathways. And as seen in the ‚out of sight™ and ‚out of \\nscope™ chapters, forgotten crises tend to focus only on the known needs Œ there may be \\nother crises where responders are not even seeking\\n funding. \\n ŠOut of sync: in the absence of a global forum for information˝sharing, funding \\ncoordination and donor ‚division of labour™ (Poole, individual donors™ selective \\ndecisions accumulate into global˝level inequities. A multilateral system predicated on \\nbilateral decisions by international donors, whose political incentives are oriented to \\nretaining control and pro˚le of what they fund (Clarke and Dercon, \\nMoesult in fragmentation. There is also a certain Western \\ndonor centricity Œ a lack of awareness, information and coordination with other sources \\nof funding beyond those from international humanitarian donors and their growing \\nroles in preparing and responding to crises typi˚ed in the Ebola outbreak and Typhoon \\nHaiyan responses.

Many of these  landslides and storms occur in places where ade\\n-quate risk reduction, preparedness and response infrastructures from national and local \\ngovernments are in place and a disaster does not become a crisis. The Hyogo and Sendai \\nFrameworks clearly locate this responsibility with domestic governments and many, par\\n-ticularly in Asia and the Americas have upped the scale and architecture of their invest\\n-ments, necessitating a change in the role and nature of international\\n support.But in many contexts, changing patterns of events exceed the coping capacities of house\\n-holds and of authorities. Mapping these underfunded localized crises and quantifying \\nﬁo˙ the radarﬂ they lack even an appeal yardstick. \\nThe IFRC and the Start Network of INGOs therefore rely on the in˝country presence of \\ntheir National Societies or members to raise the alert for small to medium emergencies \\nfor which time˝critical assistance is lacking. The allocations from their rapid response \\nfunds can give an indicative picture of where some of these funding gaps occur and for \\nwhat emergencies, albeit one framed by the scale of the funds and presence of their deliv\\n-ery organizations. \\n the IFRC™s DREF fund has responded with grant allocations to ov\\n-den˝onset disasters and emergencies that are not covered by an international IFRC appeal \\nor for which support from other national or international actors is not foreseen (IFRC, \\nˆˇ˛ˆ). More than half of these allocations were for hydro˝meteorological disasters, domi\\n-nated by the most common trigger of IFRC oper\\n-ations overall. Responses to emergencies in Africa dominated, while those to the Americas \\nwere not only the smallest but also declined Œ relative needs (mainly for \\nsmall and medium˝scale disasters) as well as growing domestic capacity in many coun\\n-tries in the region. DREF allocations also appear to ˚ll gaps that are o˙ the radar for the \\nUN˝coordinated appeal system and where there is no appeal.

Funding for DRR is not well tracked with the limited portion reported by OECD \\nDevelopment Assistance Committee (DAC) donor \\ndollars in ˆˇ, or ˇ% of oial development assistance (ODA). Increasing DRR funding \\nand spending it appropriately and e˙ectively demands partnerships from local, national, \\nregional and international providers, both public and\\n private. \\nBox 5.3\\n Private investment for collaborative approaches to\\n DRRThe Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance is a long-term collaboration that brings together \\nIFRC, NGO, academic and private sector experts in risk and resilience, working ini\\n-tially in nine countries (Mexico, Peru, Haiti, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Indonesia, \\nTimor-Leste and the US) and reaching more than 200,000 people. The ˜rst phase of \\nthe programme (2013Œ2017), supported with around CHF 37 million (37.4 million US \\ndollars6) in funding from the Z Zurich Foundation (Zurich Insurance Group™s commu\\n-nity investment foundation), has used the collective skills and experience of the mem\\n-bers to develop a new approach to DRR programming Œ encouraging funding of the \\nprocess, not just the predetermined interventions. The programme has subsequently \\nbeen extended to a second phase (2018Œ2023) with a further CHF 20 million (20.2 \\nmillion US dollars) investment that aims to use community experience and research \\ncapability to encourage more and smarter investments in pre-event ˚ood resilience \\nbuilding. By acting collectively, the alliance has developed a practical approach that \\ncan be adopted by others and encourages this to\\n happen.For weather˝related events that may outstrip risk reduction and resilience e˙orts in envi\\n-ronmentally vulnerable communities, forecasting can be used as a trigger to release pre-\\nagreed funds before, rather than compete for attention a˜er, an event Œ saving lives, time \\nand money. A clear action plan can be tied to this, so decisions about roles and respon\\n-sibilities Œ of local, national and international implementers Œ are formally agreed ahead \\nof time, incriency and e˙ectiveness. This is the premise of the forecast˝based \\n˚nancing models developed and tested over the past decade. The art, science and poli\\n-tics of forecasting areloping but this bias to action is generating learn\\n-ing and improvements. It has been successfully implemented by the IFRC including in \\nBangladesh, Peru and Mozambique and is being supported by a new DREF funding mech\\n-anism for forecast˝based\\n action. \\nImproving ex-post\\n ˘nancingWhere small˝scale disasters hit people who are not covered by these ex˝ante arrange\\n-ments, agile reactive humanitarian assistance may still be needed. In rapid˝onset crises, \\ntiming is critical Œ funding that is too late to meet immediate needs and prevent their \\nescalation can be as ine˙ectual as no funding at all. Slow funding is a common refrain \\nˆ.\\n Currency conversion (here and later in paragraph) as of ˘˛ July\\nxe.com.Operation precipitated by the in˚ux of displaced populations from Rakhine State, \\nMyanmar. Before this, in the 2017 ˚oods in Bangladesh, repeated experience of under\\n-funding prompted the Humanitarian Country Team to issue a request for funding \\nthat was lower than real needs and focus the requirements according to the scale of \\nanticipated funding. The emergency shelter request for the Bangladesh ˚oods was \\ntherefore only 3 million US dollars Œ an amount that did not cover all needs (esti\\n-mated to be in the region of 5 million US dollars) but was still only two-thirds met. \\nAs shelter underpins other sectors, such as water, sanitation and hygiene, health, \\nlivelihoods and protection, its underfunding had implications for the wider humani\\n-tarian response as well as threatening to reverse gains in development and disaster \\nrisk reduction. Particularly ‚left behind™ were the \\nchar communities Œ people living on the shifting islands in the country™s major river systems. These are some of the \\npoorest and most marginalized communities in the country for whom specialized \\nsupport in shelter and settlements could have made a substantial difference, but \\nwho were not effectively reached due to lack of\\n funding.˜˚˝˚˝ What are the solutions? \\nEnsuring swi˜ and appropriate assistance to small and rapid˝onset disasters should be \\nthe low˝hanging fruit of ˚xing crisis ˚nancing Œ at least compared with protracted com\\n-plex emergencies. These are o˜en predictable and recurrent events, and the case is clear \\n(see inter alia Clarke and Dercon, for a systemic shi˜ of approach: a shi˜ from try\\n-ing to fundraise a˜er the event to ensuring that the resources are in place before to deal \\nwith the risk, prepare for and face the immediate impacts of a disaster. This is supported \\nby commitments in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), and from the World Humanitarian Summit. The shi˜ from \\nex˝post to ex˝ante goes hand in hand with a shi˜ in perspective from international to \\nlocal ownership, and from humanitarian aid to development and climate cooperation. \\nIt involves smarter investments in pre-˚nancing as well as more agile reactive ˚nancing \\nwherever this is still\\n needed. \\nInvesting in pre-˘nancing\\nManaging risk and being ˚nancially well prepared to face it involves a ‚layered™ approach \\nwith di˙erent mechanisms in place according to the probability and scale of impact of \\nthe event (see Poole,, These high˝frequency, smaller˝scale crises should \\nbe primarily managed through emergency reserves or contingency funds held by national \\ngovernments where possible and supported by international donors only where necessary. \\nIn the Philippines, for example, local authorities are required by law to inv\\nrevenues into a disaster management fund, of which ˘ˇ% goes into a Quick Response \\nFund to react to the urgent impact of disasters, and the rest into risk reduction and pre\\n-paredness.

Asylum seekers and refu\\n-gees may resort to people smugglers, and may enter a country irregularly due to limited \\nsafe and legal channels to seek asylum. People may be recognized as refugees by the UN \\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but if the country in question does not rec\\n-ognize them or is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention, they may be treated as \\nirregular migrants.

While many of these people bene˛t from local \\nand national assistance, this is o˜en without the surge in international assistance that may \\noccur when these resources arient. In an era that increasingly recognizes a wider \\nhumanitarian ecosystem, is there an opportunity for its collective and diverse capacities \\nto be more e˚ectively applied to these types of crises? And when, where and how should \\nthe ‚traditional™ international sector evolve to\\n respond?\\nThere are many people experiencing crises who require such a rethink. These people might \\nfall out of scope for many reasons: because they are dispersed rather than in a de˛ned \\n‚crisis˝a˚ected area™, or because national authorities may not have requested assistance. \\nThey might be perceived as solely a domestic concern Œ even when local and national \\nresponders do not proient assistance or protection due to capacity constraints \\nor because politics mean that the people are excluded or marginalized. When there is no \\nsingent, chronic needs might be seen as development con\\n-cerns, and life˝saving assistance and protection may be limited. The existence or scale of \\nsu˚ering might also not be recognized by an international sector that is predicated on \\npre˝determined mandates, missions and models. Limits to aid funding can further com\\n-pound disengagement.Groups that might be considered out of scope may include people without citizenship or \\nlegal residency, such as stateless people or migrants with an irregular status, whose rights \\nare denied or not fully recognized.

Migrants often employ different psychological strategies to manage the poten\\n-tial risks including avoidance, discrediting information and harm minimization (IOM, \\n2018b). Chillingly, women in the Horn of Africa are reported to request contraception \\nbefore their journeys (RMMS, 2017). \\nExperience from the IFRC highlights that information on migratory routes is most \\neffective when it is minimal, easy to absorb, available in different languages and \\nuses a range of distribution mechanisms, for example from radio and social media to \\nlow-tech methods and peer-to-peer sharing (IFRC, 2016a).

Much of the data and research focuses on journeys to Europe, but \\nas Box 6.2 shows, there is increasing evidence that these risks are common across \\nall migratory routes, including in Africa (RMMS, 2017); migration to the Middle East \\n(IOM, 2018b), from South and Central America into the US (Crisis Group 2016) and \\nwithin and across Asia (IOM, 2017a). Dangers facing migrants, which are often over\\n-lapping and deadly, can\\n include:  ŠDrowning at sea, due to overcrowded or unseaworthy craft \\nor dangerous weather. This risk is increasing: although fewer \\nmigrants crossed the Mediterranean in 2017 than previous years, a \\nhigher percentage of people crossing that year (1.8%, over 3,000 \\npeople) are recorded to have died or gone missing (IOM, 2017). \\n ŠExposure in the desert: according to UNHCR interviews with people \\nwho had travelled through Libya en route to Europe ﬁmore people \\ndie in the desert, on the way than in the seaﬂ (UNHCR, 2017d).\\n ŠHarsh environmental conditions combined with a lack of basic services: \\ndata shows that 60% of the casualties of migrants from the Horn of \\nAfrica were caused by the harsh living conditions experienced on the \\njourney, including lack of access to healthcare, lack of food or water, \\ninadequate shelter and exposure to harsh weather (RMMS, 2017). \\n ŠKilled by traf˜ckers and criminal gangs: for example in \\nthe town of Beni Walid in Libya in 2018 some 15 people \\nwere killed in one night and another 25 wounded when \\ntraf˜ckers shot at them trying to escape (MSF, 2018).\\nThe real number of people who have died is unknown, as people move, and thus die, \\ninvisibly. Most deaths are not registered, especially when they occur in poorer and \\nremote regions (ICRC, 2017a). \\nRisk of death is just part of the picture. Interviews conducted by the Danish Refugee \\nCouncil™s Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat between 2014 and 2017 revealed that \\n79% of migrants interviewed from the Horn of Africa had either directly witnessed \\nor experienced one or multiple abuses, ranging from physical and sexual violence to \\nkidnapping, torture and death (RMMS, 2017). \\nMigration risks are affected by gender.

The search and \\nidenti˜cation of missing migrants is hampered by a lack of prioritization, resources, \\nforensics capacities as well as centralized, standardized, transnational information \\ncollection and management mechanisms. In the Mediterranean, only around 35% of \\nrecorded migrant deaths are identi˜ed; this is much less in poorer or more remote \\nareas (IOM, 2017a). \\nThe Senegalese Red Cross Society and ICRC began a project to support the fami\\n-lies of missing migrants. By 2017, 200 relatives were supported with mental health \\nand psychosocial activities, commemorative events, literacy classes and vocational \\ntraining. Micro-credit support for income-generating activities was also provided. A \\nstrong component involves linking families to governmental support, and educating \\nauthorities on the humanitarian needs of migrants and their families (ICRC, 2017a). \\nThis work with the families of missing migrants complements long-standing work \\nby the Movement on Restoring Family Links which aims to locate missing people, \\nincluding migrants, and put them in contact with their\\n relatives.\\nTraf˜cked\\n migrants\\nAround three˝quarterants interview were \\nsubjected to abuses that may amount to trking along the North African and Central \\nMediterranean route.

This section has shown that irregular migrants Œ who lack state protection and in many \\ncases are deliberately denied their basic rights and assistance Œ face violence, abuse and \\nexploitation in transit and on arrival. Despite this, the o˜en˝deliberate invisibility of irreg\\n-ular migrants, lack of reliable data on their numbers and vulnerabilities, and their disper\\n-sal across routes and countries means the scale of need associated with irregular migra\\n-tion relative to other humanitarian crises is to discern.

In some \\ncontexts, humanitarian activities have been actively criminalized, restricted or discour\\n-aged as they intersect with state strategies for migration management. One example is the \\ne˚orts to criminalize humanitarian search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea \\n(see EU, Charges of human smuggling were brought against volunteer lifeguards in \\nGreece (Aljazeera, while media and political accusations have been levelled against \\nNGOs involved in search and rescue missions as ‚colluding with smugglers™. \\nE˚orts to criminalize and delegitimize humanitarian activities can not only reduce life˝sav\\n-ing assistance, but also validate stronger deterrence measures, including support to the \\nLibyan coast guard to deter migrants from leaving Libya (Nando, There are signi˛\\n-cant dilemmas associated with humanitarian action in situations or processes designed to \\ncontrol migration where there is major humanitarian need, but a risk that getting involved \\ncould be perceived as legitimizing or perpetuating the migration control measures.

Some workers were unable to escape due \\nto being locked in houses while their sponsors had ˚ed. Irregular migrants wishing \\nto leave Lebanon faced ˜nes as a result of their immigration status. Migrant domes\\n-tic worker networks played a signi˜cant role in reducing some of these risks, includ\\n-ing establishing a hotline for workers trapped in houses. Support from civil society \\nactors, such as Caritas Lebanon Œ which had pre-existing links with this community \\nbefore the con˚ict Œ and IOM, helped ensure irregular workers were assisted with \\nshelter, support and evacuations by embassies (Hendow et al, 2017). \\nIrregular migrants lack an international convention and institutional\\n engagement The fact that humanitarians o˜en need an event to catalyse engagement is not the only \\nreason why migrants are o˜en considered out of scope.

As are life˝saving \\nactivities such as emergency evacuations from life˝threatening situations such as deten\\n-tion centres in Libya (UNHCR, ˙ˆˇ˘b) by IOM and\\n UNHCR. \\nHumanitarians consulted for this research highlighted a range of constraints around the \\nscale,iency and impact of protection activities for irregular migrants. These con\\n-cerns inc the impact of promoting greater respect for rights in a \\ngeneral climate of strong political and public support for robust deterrence measures, \\nand the inadequate reach and scale of protection activities in situations where violence \\nis the norm and there are few avenues for protection. For instance, concerns were raised \\nthat even when there is evidence of widespread trking, only a minority of cases can be \\nsupported due to limited capacity of humanitarian responders, few referral mechanisms \\nand limited national capacities. The response is o˜en repatriation, which o˜en does not \\nresolve the issue. Finally, there are concerns that even when support is made available, \\nthere are few opportunities for individualized protection measures or case management \\napproaches even in situations involving highly vulnerable\\n migrants. \\nMany barriers prevent migrants from seeking assistance and humanitarian agencies from \\nrecognizing and responding to them. Although there are many long˝term undocumented \\nmigrants in many contexts, people on the move are by de˛nition mobile, o˜en travelling \\nin remote, rural areas, and on routes that shi˜ regularly. The rapid movement means there \\nis limited opportunity for assessment, support and referral, and migrants will o˜en forego \\nall but the most urgent assistance. The shi˜ing nature of the movement makes planning, \\nforentions challenging. The irregular, extra˝territorial and \\nclandestine nature of irregular migration means that many migrants face many of the bar\\n-riers outlined so far in this report. These include fear of detection, language, information \\nand administrative barriers, cultural and gender barriers and at times perceived or actual \\ndiscrimination on the part of front˝line\\n sta˚.\\nates, some organizations have responded by establishing mobile facil\\n-ities along routes, transport centres and in areas where migrants congregate. These are \\no˜en focused on medical assistance, basic needs and psychological support, though many \\norganizations report concerns about the reach and coverage of their activities. Local and \\nnational individuals and institutions Œ including community groups, religious institutions \\nand other civil society actors Œ o˜en play important role approaches, \\npresence along routes and wide geographical\\n scope. \\nBox 6.7\\n Learning from MSF™s work to treat migrants in \\nMexico ˜eeing, and facing,\\n violence For years, Mexican civil society organizations, with the support of a few international \\nNGOs, including MSF, have run an extended network of over 100 \\nalbergues\\n (hostels) \\n156157\\nOut of scope: irregular migrants and people a˜ected by urban violence\\nFig. 6.2\\n World™s ˛˝ most violent cities,\\n ˙˝ˆˇ Homicide rate: most ˚    \\n˛˛˛ least ˚ \\n  \\n˝˙ \\n  North America\\n  Central America  Caribbean  South America  Sub-Saharan Africa\\nNote: Figure 6.2 does not include war-related deaths whereas Figure 6.3 does.\\nSource: Proyecto de Opinión Pública de Americá Latina (LAPOP) (2014) and Seguridad, Justicia y Paz (2017)\\nFig. 6.3\\n Countries with the highest violent death rates,\\n ˙˝ˆ˘RankCountryViolent death rate (per 100,000 people)\\n1Syria\\n *2El Salvador\\n3Venezuela\\n4Saint Kitts and Nevis\\n5Honduras ˘ˇ.ˇ 6Afghanistan\\n * ˘˛.ˆ 7Jamaica ˛˘.ˆ 8Iraq *9Libya\\n *10Somalia ** Experiencing or emerging from con˜ict\\nSource: Small Arms Survey Database on Violent Deaths 2017 drawn from of˚cial \\nand non-of˚cial data on violent death and homicide rates in\\n 2016.\\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˘\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCountryNumber of cities  in 50 most violentFeeling of lack of \\n safety due to crimeVenezuela \\n567%Mexico\\n1250%El Salvador\\n146%Brazil1743%Guatemala\\n140%Honduras234%United States\\n415%˜˜˜˚˛˛communities, Maldivian Red Crescent targeted both documented and undocumented \\nmigrant communities.

After Syria, El Salvador had \\nthe highest rate of violent deaths in the world in 2017.

This is a major factor in being perceived as out of scope: even urban experts do \\nnot judge collective urban violence as a priority humanitarian issue (Savage and Muggah, \\n˙ˆˇ˙). Further, because relevant non˝state actors (for example gangs and drug cartels) do \\nnot have international obligations Œ as people party to arve under inter\\n-national humanitarian law Œ authorities and others need to be fully informed of the strict \\nhumanitarian basis of any dialogue with these non˝state actors, where such a dialogue is \\nallowed under domestic\\n law. \\nFurthermore, unlike in many traditional humanitarian settings, people a˚ected by urban \\nviolence are not con˛ned to one geographical location and are instead dispersed within \\nand across cities, making it morn and quantify needs. Complacency \\nand culture among humanitarian actors also reportedly play a role. People consulted sug\\n-gested that the dominance of French and English˝speaking humanitarian agencies and \\nsta˚ mean that humanitarian issues in Spanish˝speaking contexts attract less attention at \\nthe global level. Although some agencies are present, they tend to be oriented to longer-\\nterm development and so less likely to see the humanitarian\\n implications. \\nICRC™s work to frame situations of collective violence below the threshold of an armed \\n where violent acts committed by one or several large groups of people may have \\nhumanitarian consequences, as ‚other situations of violence™ has been particularly helpful. \\nIt has helped broaden recognition beyond ICRC that such contexts warrant greater human\\n-itarian attention and potentially, response, to address their consequences ( \\n˜˚˝˚ˆ Urban settings challenge traditional humanitarian response methods \\nand approaches \\nA further constraint to providing a response to urban violence is the questioning of the \\nrelevance and feasibility of humanitarian action in such settings. Urban violence Œ and \\nindeed responses to humanitarian crises in urban settings more broadly Œ poses a num\\n-ber of challenges to humanitarian responders including a need for a di˚erent approach \\nto needs assessment and programme design. High population density means that high \\nnumbers of people may be a˚ected and the diversity of urban populations require dif\\n-ferentiated targeting approaches (Lucchi, The requirement to work across various \\ncross˝lines further complicates engagement, as areas may be under the authority of dif\\n-ferent groups, including criminal gangs, and some of these groups may be listed as ter\\n-rorist under national\\n legislation. \\nDonors and agencies committed to providing a humanitarian response to urban violence \\nhighlight the consistent internal advocacy needed to shore up relatively small amounts \\nof funding. One major feature of the response by humanitarians thus far has been gen\\n-erating evidence to inform the advocacy undertaken in agencies and across the sector to \\nencourage greater recognition of the issue (HPN webinar, Perhaps as a consequence, \\nagencies such as ICRC and MSF, with signi˛cant amounts of independent funding, have \\nOrganized violence perpetrated by armed groups, gangs, organized criminals, drug \\ntraf˜ckers and some members of the state underpin alarming rates of casualties, sex\\n-ual violence, kidnapping, forced displacement and forced con˜nement. The collapse \\nof law and order, shattering of social and health services and the implications of the \\nreduced mobility resulting from the violence for access to basic services, markets, \\nlivelihoods and social networks are just some of the more indirect consequences \\n(Lucchi, 2014). There are important gender and age dimensions too, with young men \\nin particular at risk of murder, forced recruitment, forced displacement or con˜ne\\n-ment (IFRC, 2010b). There are also high rates of femicide, and women are subjected \\nto sexual and gender-based violence too (HPN webinar, 2017). \\nMany features of armed con˚ict are also evident, including widespread child recruit\\n-ment, lack of access to life-saving medical care and basic education, and attacks \\non the medical mission (ACAPS, 2014). The effect on education is just one exam\\n-ple: in El Salvador, 50% of educational facilities are located in areas racked by crim\\n-inality or gang violence resulting in over 15,000 cases of school dropouts; and in \\nHonduras, some 460 educational facilities were closed in 2017 due to extortion and \\nthreats (OCHA, 2017c).\\n˜˚˝˚˝ Why is there an urban violence ‚blind spot™ in humanitarian\\n action? \\nMost urban violence takes place in middle˝income countries, not helping perceptions that \\nthis is not an issue for donors and humanitarian responders used to providing assistance \\nin lower˝income settings (HPN webinar, This is despite authorities e˚ectively losing \\ncontrol in many of the a˚ected neighbourhoods, where they are either unable or unwill\\n-ing to provide security and basic services (Savage and Muggah, ˙ˆˇ˙). Yet a˚ected states \\nhave been slow to acknowledge the issue and seek external support. Neither Guatemala \\nnor El Salvador recognize internal displacement per se (Bassau, although Honduras, \\nwith UNHCR support, has become increasingly committed to preventing and address\\n-ing internal\\n displacement. \\nIn El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras (‚Northern Triangle of Central America™ coun\\n-tries ( national actors play a signi˛cant role in addressing urban violence, \\no˜en focusing on reducing risks for vulnerable youth, supporting community policing and \\nupgrading slums, for example (OECD, ˙ˆˇˇ).

With its highly con˛g\\n-ured architecture and already over˝stretched resources and capacities, to what degree should \\nthe current sector adapt and respond to these and other new forms of complex\\n needs?Local and national actors are undertaking some of the most e˚ective action to address cri\\n-ses considered out of scope by the sector. People a˚ected, their networks and wider com\\n-munities are o˜en the ˛rst line of response and defence, as is true in any humanitarian \\ncrisis. It is with national actors, including governments, that the main opportunity lies in \\nmounting more e˚ective, enduring responses. Costly, direct implementation by interna\\n-tional actors in these long˝term situations of vulnerability is unsustainable over the long \\nterm; however, it remains important in situations where capacities are overwhelmed, and \\nwhere a neutral third party is\\n bene˛cial. \\nThe ‚localization™ agenda has galvanized greater recognition and engagement that the inter\\n-national humanitarian sector must transform to ﬁreinforce, rather than replace, local and \\nnational capacitiesﬂ (Grand Bargain, The issues of irregular migration and urban vio\\n-lence serve to illustrate that this agenda is just as relevant to ongoing situations of vulner\\n-ability as it is to humanitarian crises already seen as in ‚scope™ of humanitarian response. \\nWith this in mind, the following actions are\\n recommended. \\n˜˚˙˚˛ Policy and\\n coordination \\n ŠDeveloping normative and policy frameworks would help focus attention and \\nengagement on the needs and vulnerabilities of people who currently fall out of scope \\nof humanitarian action. The work to develop guidelines on migrants in vulnerable \\nsituations, and to conceive ‚other situations of violence™, demonstrate how such \\nprocesses can foster wider ownership across humanitarian communities and can be \\nused as a basis for advocating for greater\\n action. \\n ŠGiven the humanitarian sector™s dependence on mandated lead agencies to trigger \\nattention, engagement and action, consideration should be given as to whether there \\nis a need for a lead agency to take a much stronger role in identifying unaddressed \\nneed and advocating for more systematic support to local and national responders. The \\ncases of both irregular migrants and people a˚ected by urban violence have illustrated \\nhow certain people and types of need fall outside the mould of traditional response \\n(no speci˛c event trigger or lead agency) and therefore fail to trigger the same kind of \\nresponse a˚orded to other types of humanitarian\\n crisis. \\n ŠIn the case of irregular migration, where it is clear that the complexity, global nature \\nand scale of vulnerabilities are reaching or have reached crisis levels, the rights˝based \\nrole of IOM should be reinforced to ensure a multilateral\\n response. \\nbeen central to the response ( More recently, UNHCR, World \\nFood Programme, the Norwegian Refugee Council and others have also scaled up by pro\\n-viding a range of humanitarian and protection\\n support. \\nBox 6.10\\n ICRC™s response to the humanitarian consequences of urban violence\\n5Over the last decade, the ICRC, together with National Societies, has been increas\\n-ingly trying to protect and assist people and communities affected by situations of \\nviolence that do not reach the threshold of an armed con˚ict and where international \\nhumanitarian law is not\\n applicable. \\nGaining acceptance of all relevant national and local stakeholders is vital to ensuring \\nICRC™s access to areas affected. ICRC™s neutral, independent and impartial approach, \\ncoupled with con˜dentiality, is crucial in this process of ensuring acceptance. This \\napproach is also essential to building a dialogue with state and non-state armed \\nactors; a dialogue which is aimed not only at reducing the impact of urban violence \\non the population, but also on the state™s ability to provide basic public services and \\neconomic opportunities. \\nPartnerships are key to the enhanced sustainability and relevance of ICRC™s responses. \\nThese have included partnerships with National Societies, but also with local and \\nnational authorities, such as health and education providers. Partnerships with grass\\n-roots organizations have also been a strong feature, helping to ensure innovative and \\ndurable responses, building on local expertise and reinforcing the resilience of the \\naffected communities by involving them in identifying and mitigating their\\n needs.\\n˜˚˙ Into scope: conclusions \\nand recommendations Examining the factors that render human su˚ering out of scope of the international \\nhumanitarian sector raises important issues about how the sector adapts and responds \\nto newly emerging forms of need Œ and what interests, ethics and events drive change. \\nHumanitarianism is not static.

Disaster trends and IFRC \\ninsights\\nThis section moves away from a thematic review of who is le˜ behind in humani\\n-tarian response to take stock of global disaster trends and what they have meant \\nfor the IFRC network™s disaster risk management e˚orts over the last ten years. \\nThe focus is on disasters, however some of the data also looks at complex emergencies \\nand overall humanitarian needs at a global scale as relevant. It looks ˛rst to the availa\\n-ble data to see what it reveals about the nature, frequency and location of disaster events \\nand the IFRC™s response. Equally important, it looks to the gaps in the available data, \\nand how they might skew an understanding of today™s risk environment. It then exam\\n-ines key recent trends in disaster risk management from the IFRC™s experience that go \\nﬁbeyond the numbersﬂ. \\nBox 7.1\\n A note on the two main data sources used in this\\n sectionEM-DAT is the Emergency Events Database at the Université Catholique de Louvain. \\nIt collects and compiles information on ‚natural™ and technological disasters from \\npublic sources. EM-DAT data does not include war, con˜ict or con˜ict-related fam\\n-ine disaster events. Natural disaster data includes: weather-related events (mete\\n-orological, such as storms and extreme temperatures; hydrological, such as ˜oods, \\nmudslides and pluvial/˜ash ˜oods; and climatological, such as droughts and wild\\n-˚res), geophysical events such as earthquakes, and biological events/epidemics. \\nData about technological disasters is not included in this\\n analysis.\\nIn previous \\nWorld Disasters Reports \\nEM-DAT data\\n has been presented in tabular for\\n-mat in the annex. This year™s report attempts to provide a visual summary of the \\ndata, primarily focusing on 2008Œ2017, with reference to the previous decade (1998Œ\\n2007). Further details are available in the Data notes or\\n online.\\nIFRC GO is a publicly available data source that provides information on disasters that \\nhave triggered a Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF), emergency appeal or move\\n-ment-wide appeal. It also contains plans of action, ˚eld reports, surge deployments, \\nsituation reports etc., and displays these in an easy to use interface as well as through \\nmaps, charts and infographics. The IFRC launched the GO platform in 2018 to chan\\n-nel emergency operations information across the Red Cross Red Crescent\\n Network.\\n167\\nAs Figure ˝.˙ shows, the number of \\n˜oods (ˆ,ˇ˙˙) by far outstrips the number of \\nstorms\\n (ˆ,˘˘ˆ), other welated inciggers recorded over \\nthe period.

In terms of value, amounts are driven by \\nlosses in wealthier countries where both asset values and insurance penetration are higher.\\nFig. 7.2\\n Comparing types of disasters between the two last\\n decades  Floods  Storms\\n Extreme temperatures, droughts, landslides, wild˜res\\n  Earthquakes, volcanoes, mass movements\\n  EpidemicsSource: EM-DAT \\nThe Emergency Events\\n Database While a˚ecting far fewer people than some of the other categoriesmillion), the \\nstorms account for a greater proportion of deaths, at ˆ˘%.

However, the IFRC has also placed special emphasis on \\nAfrica and on responses to epidemic outbreaks Œ reaching the greatest numbers of peo\\n-ple there with activities to monitor and control their spread, as well as directly support\\n-ing people impacted by the disease. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the IFRC appeals do track \\nclosely with countries considered to be politically or environmentally\\n fragile. \\nSome of these appeals relate to natural hazards happening in a complex environment. \\nHowever, the IFRC is also quite active and sougieties \\nin response to mde disasters, particularly population movements, but also complex \\nemergencies and civil unrest. These types of crises made up more than half of the IFRC \\noperational budgets in ˙˘ˆ˝ and represent nearly half of the people targeted, at the time \\nof writing, Africa and the Middle East led the world with countries experiencing \\nmultiple types of crises at once, with a high concentration of need in just a few\\n countries. \\n˜˚˝ Data gaps and\\n trendsWhile the data provides important insights about disasters and disaster response Œ it is \\nalso critical to understand its limits. Data itself has become a primary preoccupation in \\nthe ˛eld of disaster management and the humanitarian sector more broadly. Thus, the \\ntrends about how data is gathered and used have become central aspects of the human\\n-itarian\\n landscape.˜˚˝˚˛ What is missing?The data presented in the previous sections proes on disasters \\nand the people a˚ected by them, based mainlyAT data (a curated and veri˛ed \\ncompilation of data drawn from UN, government and other sources) and IFRC GO data \\n(which contains details of DREFs, emergency and mov) and the FDRS \\n(which reporting by National Societies and is only recently gathering com\\n-prehensive data). Such brse has its limits, as people involved in \\nthe collection, curation and use of underlying data, as well as its selection and presenta\\n-tion, are o˜en acutely aware.

Initially piloting in 11 coun\\n-tries, the American Red Cross, the IFRC and National Society CP3 partners will work \\nwith country-level stakeholders to identify the core data sets essential in a disas\\n-ter situation or health emergency. Up-to-date information on road networks, health \\ninfrastructure, climate patterns, disease incidence, population density and health \\nbehaviours can be vital in an outbreak. The Red Cross and Red Crescent team will \\nwork to locate, validate and openly release this information with its owners™ permis\\n-sion.

These efforts will help to improve ‚data readiness™ for planning, imple\\n-menting, monitoring and reporting during disaster\\n response.\\nData\\n protection\\nWhile various humanitarian agencies have policies and guidelines on data protection Œ \\nand while investments in data and information communication technology are enabling \\ndisaster information, preparedness and response e˚orts Œ operating in the new order rep\\n-resents a considerable challenge. In May the EU Global Data Protection Regulations \\n(GDPR) came into force, prompting a thorough rethink of collection and storage of per\\n-sonal data (Parker, Yet considerations are not just limited to (data) protection and \\nsecurity. Better provision has to be made for the rights to information, protection from \\nharm, data agency and to redress and recti˛cation\\n (Greenwood et al, ˙˘ˆ˝). Identi˛ed by \\nthe Signal Code, these rights are the result of a six by the Signal Program on \\nHuman Security and Technology at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative (HHI) and require \\ninvestment. Not just ˛nancial invls, technology and ‚innovations™ \\nbut also in standards, partnerships and di˚erent ways of working (Greenwood et al, ˙˘ˆ˝). \\nﬁThe scale of data, facilitated by modern information \\ntechnology, is now such that state borders and discrete \\ntimescales are increasingly diˆcult to apply to data \\ncollection and processing. Data can be collected remotely, \\nfrom populations which are unaware, and transmitted \\naround the world in an instant. Once collected and \\ntransmitted, data live forever.

The ˛rst is in the conception of what should be tallied \\nŒ what counts as a disaster and what type of impact should be assessed. The second con\\n-cerns those not captured even in de˛nitional limits, for the many reasons explained in \\nthe preceding chapters. Data can also be actively harmful to the people it seeks to help, if \\nthe means of gathering, storing and analyzing it are not careful and sophisticated\\n enough. \\nTo address both the opportunities and the caveats, a led™ rather than a iven™ \\nhumanitarianism is needed Œ one that starts with understanding the rig\\n-fected people and safeguarding against the potential dehumanization of humanitarianism \\n(whereby data and new technologies become the central focus rather than the enablers). \\nInvestment should also be made in common standards, and in digital literacy and digital \\naccess, as vital components of humanitar, expendable\\n overheads.\\nFinally, the humanitarian sector needs to get better at using the data it has, and not wait \\nto act because not everything is known. It needs to do better at combining and using data \\nfrom di˚erent sources and new technologies. In particular this includes cated \\ndata and data around community needs, perceptions and\\n capacities.\\n˜˚˙ Beyond the numbers: IFRC insights on \\nrecent trends in disaster\\n management While the data Œ and its limits Œ is very important, it cannot tell the whole story about \\nhow disaster management is evolving. This section examines progress in three areas of \\nthe IFRC™s work in disaster\\n management: Šearly action in celated disasters and epidemic\\n response;\\n Šprogress in the ‚localization™ of humanitarian aid;\\n and Šprogress in the Red Cross and Red Crescent work in disaster\\n law.\\n194195\\nDisaster trends and IFRC insights\\nservices had established forecast thresholds for ˜oods for the target regions in advance. \\nThis followed extensive assessments in the communities as well as analysis of past \\nextreme events and available forecasts. Once the main humanitarian impact of such \\nextreme weather events on the population had been identi˚ed Œ through discus\\n-sions in the communities, but also surveys, studies and historical data Œ the FbF team \\nselected those early actions considered most appropriate to mitigate these impacts \\nin the communities.\\nAn evaluation of the impact of the Bangladesh FbF pilot showed that the number of \\npeople who had to take on loans or who lost livestock during the ˜ood was signi˚\\n-cantly lower in the FbF communities than in neighbouring areas. Hence these peo\\n-ple recovered much more quickly and will undoubtedly be more resilient to facing \\nsimilar disasters in the future.\\nDespite good progress, there is still a long way to go for anticipatory approaches like FbF \\nto be adopted as a new normal (Wilkinson et al, More governments should imple\\n-ment the approach into their disaster risk management frameworks, plans and laws. More \\ndonors should makle, tring available, notwithstanding the risk \\nthat the forecasted event may not occur. More agencies should engage in FbF schemes. \\nIt is time to bring FbF to\\n scale.Early action on epidemics The ˙˘ˆnd ˙˘ˆˇ Ebola outbreak that killed more than ˆˆ,˘˘˘ people across three coun\\n-tries served as a waknational humanitarian sector. This experience \\nmade very clear that much swi˜er action will be needed to avoid major loss of life, both \\nin detection and acting to contain and prevent the spread of such\\n diseases. \\nThe focus at the policy level on health security and pandemic preparedness, including \\nnational implementation of the International Health Regulations, has increased and remains \\na top priority. orld Health Assembly, the Global Preparedness Monitoring \\nBoard was launched to monitor and report on the status of emergency health prepared\\n-ness (WHO,).\\nThe key question, however, is whether there has been any change in domestic prepared\\n-ness and in the speed of response by the humanitarian sector.ws there are \\nencouraging signs it\\n has. \\nBox 7.4\\n Comparing haemorrhagic fever outbreaks in 2014, 2017 and\\n 2018Ebola in West Africa (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), 2014Œ2016 (2.5\\n years)\\nEbola was ˚rst publicly identi˚ed in Guinea on 14 March 2014. The Guinean Government \\ndeclared the outbreak eight days later, on 22 March. The ˚rst WHO report was released \\nthe following day and WHO reported 49 cases of the disease, including 29 deaths in \\nGuinea. Five days later the IFRC launched its appeal, but money was slow to come in, \\nand almost a month later there was only 14% coverage. On 8 August, WHO declared \\nthe epidemic a ﬁpublic health emergency of international concernﬂ. By September, \\nroles and responsibilities of all involved in implementing the actions are de˛ned in early \\naction protocols.\\nIn collaboration with partners,ieties in Africa, the Americas and Asia-\\nPaci˛c are at various stages of implementing FbF pilot projects.\\n˙˙ With the FbF method\\n-ology, forecasts have successfully triggered early action by National Societies in Peru, Togo, \\nUganda, Bangladesh and Mongolia. To scale up this anticipatory approach, IFRC has also \\njust established a new funding mechanism, the ForAction by the DREF\\n to \\nenable National Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies to access predictable funding for \\nearly action. The funding will be directed towards activities prin early action \\nprotocols, triggered by hazards that can be scienti˛cally forecast based on hydr\\n-ological risk data and\\n observations.\\nThe IFRC is not alone in developing and pioneering the FbF approach, other partners \\nsuch as the World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization and the Start \\nNetwork have also been exploring and implementing approaches based on similar prin\\n-ciples. FbF and similar anticipatory early action approaches being pursued by other part\\n-ners are attracting more support, particularly as they can serve as a bridge between human\\n-itarian development and climate funding, and ensure better preparedness for changing \\nclimate risks across\\n timescales. \\nHowever, working with the concept of probability, predicted severe impacts do not always \\nmaterialize even a˜er the funding has been released, as seen in a few cases in the imple\\n-mentation of FbF, such as in Peru and Uganda. Nevertheless, FbF is designed so that the \\nrisk of acting in vain is outweighed by the likely bene˛ts of preventing or preparing for \\ndisaster and over time the negative consequences of not taking early action are greater \\nthan occasionally acting in vain\\n (Coughlan de Perez et al, \\nBox 7.3\\n Forecast-based ˇnancing in practice in\\n BangladeshAs predicted by meteorologists, extensive rainfall at the end of July 2017 caused \\nsevere ˜ooding in areas along the Brahmaputra River in Bangladesh.

Up to \\n˚ve days before the ˜ood peak was reached, Bangladesh Red Crescent Society with \\nsupport from the German Red Cross had already initiated early action. The popula\\n-tion received early warning messages and cash was distributed to 1,039 vulnerable \\nhouseholds. This cash allowed the families at risk to buy what they needed to survive \\nand to bring themselves to safety without getting into debt or selling their\\n property.\\nThis successful intervention was possible because ˚nancial resources were made \\navailable before the disaster hit in the framework of FbF.

On 8 December, roughly six weeks after \\nthe start of the outbreak, the Ugandan Ministry of Health declared the outbreak con\\n-tained.

Shortly afterwards, 21 people were con˚rmed as having caught Ebola. \\nThree days later (19 May) more than 7,000 doses of the vaccine arrived in Kinshasa. \\nBy 24 May, 16 days after the outbreak was identi˚ed, more than 150 people had been \\nvaccinated. Within 35 days of the ˚rst veri˚ed case the number of cases had pla\\n-teaued with 28 people having died, 38 con˚rmed cases of people infected and 14 \\npossible cases. The outbreak was declared of˚cially over on 24 July 2018 by WHO \\nand DRC Ministry of Health, 42 days (two incubation periods) after blood samples \\nfrom the last con˚rmed Ebola patient twice tested negative for the disease. In total, \\n33 people died..This chart shows a more serious and rapid response. The humanitarian sector is shifting \\ntime scales; scaling up responses with just a handful of cases; and focusing on tiny, fast \\nresponses to stop the disease quickly at its source, if possible. This is clearly a success\\n-ful approach and gives greater hope of being better able to confront future\\n outbreaks. \\n In terms of joint activity to address the outbreak, the response was led by health authorities in Uganda and Kenya. \\nThey received support from WHO, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, the US Centers for Disease \\nControl and Prevention, the African Field Epidemiology Network, UNICEF, MSF, IFRC, ICRC, the Uganda Red \\nCross Society, the EU Commission™s Civil Protection Mechanism and Emergency Response Coordination Centre, the \\nBernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine and University of Marburg, Germany, the EU™S European Mobile Lab \\nConsortium, Alliance for International Medical Action, the Uganda Virus Research Institute, Joint Mobile Emerging \\nDiseases Intervention Clinical Capability, Infectious Diseases Institute of Makerere University, the Kenya Red Cross \\nSociety and the Kenya Medical Research Institute (see WHO, ˙˘ˆ˝a).\\n198Disaster trends and IFRC insights\\nFig. 7.22\\n  \\nComparison of Ebola caseload and response times betwest Africa Ebola \\noutbreak and the ˜˚˝˛ DRC Equateur\\n outbreak Ebola ˆ cases (cumulative)\\n  Ebola ˆ deaths (cumulative)\\n Notes: See next page for more detail of the DRC Equateur outbreak and response.\\nSources: WHO Situation reports (2014Œ2016), CDC Case counts (2014Œ2016)\\n30,000\\n22,50015,000\\n7,500\\n0˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚..............................˚0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360 390 420 450 480 510 540 570 600 630 660 690 720 750 780 8103/14/14 Guinea Ministry of Health identi˚es ˚rst case3/18/14 First MSF Team \\nin Guinea3/22/14 Guinea Government \\ndeclares outbreak3/23/14 \\nWHO report on Ebola \\nvirus disease released3/28/14 IFRC DREF launched6/21/14 MSF press release Œ call for assistance\\n7/24/14 WHO upgrades epidemic to crisis level 3\\n8/1/14 WHO response phase 1: rapid scale-up of response8/8/14 Announcement of West Africa Ebola \\nas public health concern worldwide\\n9/30/14 Red Cross has 3,500 \\nvolunteers in response \\nand operations in 11 countries11/5/1460 community care centre beds operational11/9/14131 trained safe and digni˚ed burial teams operational11/18/14IFRC reports \\n556 safe and digni˚ed burials11/23/14\\n221 trained safe burial teams operational11/24/14WHO mobilises 11/26/141,188 Ebola treatment centre beds operational12/1/14On average, number \\nof new contacts per \\ncase is: 17 in Guinea, \\n22 in Liberia and 6 in Sierra Leone\\n12/3/14517 treatment beds operational in 12 Ebola treatment centres12/21/14Treatment beds operational: \\n250 in Guinea, 650 in Liberia \\nand 833 in Sierra Leone\\n12/22/14WHO upgrades epidemic to crisis level 3\\n1/1/15WHO response phase 2: increasing capacity for case ˚nding, \\ncontact tracing \\nand community engagement1/4/15All three intense-transmission countries have capacity to isolate \\nall reported cases\\n1/21/1527 laboratories providing case \\ncon˚rmation3/25/15In areas with receding transmission, national \\nauthorities prepare to decommission surplus facilities4/22/15Community engagement improving in Guinea \\nand Sierra Leone\\n6/17/15Health checkpoints set up in western \\nregions of Guinea8/1/15WHO response phase 3: interrupt transmission \\nof Ebola virus5/29/16WHO declares end of epidemicThe ˜rst ˘˝ days, to compare with Figure ˇ.˛ˆ \\n200201Disaster trends and IFRC insights\\nVarious factors are crucial to a successful response that quickly quells a disease before \\nit is able to spread; ˛rstly, experience at both diagnosis and response in the community \\nwhere the outbreak takes place. For example, in the case of the ˙˘ˆ˝ Marburgh outbreak, \\nthe location was known as a hotspot for haemorrhagic fever and Uganda had experience \\nin identifying and managing Marburg virus disease outbreaks.

In the last ten years, the IFRC™s international operations have \\nresponded to 1,107 crises, and in the ˚rst quarter of 2018 there were 53 ongoing, inter\\n-nationally funded operations covering 50 countries and tarmil\\n-lion people for assistance. At the same time National Societies have each responded \\nto many more such disasters every year in their own countries without any inter\\n-national assistance. For example, from July 2016 to June 2017, American Red Cross \\nresponded to 260 ﬁlarge-scale disastersﬂ in 45 states and two US territories includ\\n-ing wild˚res, storms and ˜ooding (American Red Cross, 2017). \\nMexican Red Cross responded to a signi˚cant earthquake and two major tropical \\nstorms in 2017, as well as a hurricane and ˜oods in 2016. For the earthquake, Mexican \\nRed Cross mobilized 1,200 search and rescue team members, established 16 collec\\n-tion centres with 31,000 volunteers and delivered 4,507 tonnes of humanitarian aid \\nmillion people in need. There was a small amount of international sup\\n-port provided for the earthquake response (some direct ˚nancial support as well as \\nadditional search and rescue personnel from other National Red Cross Societies in \\nthe region) but all the other disaster response initiatives were without formal inter\\n-national support. \\nSimilarly, in 2016 Kenya Red Crmillion people, \\nincluding responding to a cholera epidemic that affected 30 of its 47 counties, the \\nChikungunya epidemic, ˜oods in 4 counties including Nairobi, the impact of con˜icts \\nand attacks on communities in 4 counties, and residential and commercial building \\ncollapses. But few of these crises hit the international news or led to an appeal for \\ninternational assistance.\\nTime to recognize and promote the crucial role of local and national\\n actors\\nThe capabilities and contributions of local and national humanitarian actors are o˜en sig\\n-ni˛cant.

These three countries have signi˚cant experience preparing \\nfor and responding to earthquakes, hurricanes, ˜oods, ˚res and other events. But \\nwhat about a truly catastrophic incident in North America that overwhelms one of \\ntheir capacities to respond? How could they work together as a region to provide a \\nrapid and effective\\n response? This question was central to the North American Humanitarian Response Summit \\nproject, implemented by the American Red Cross in partnership with the Canadian \\nRed Cross, the Mexican Red Cross and with the direct participation of their respec\\n-tive governments. The project™s goal is to improve the effectiveness of cross-bor\\n-der response to a potential catastrophic disaster in North America. A multinational \\nlegal and policy scan and analysis were conducted as part of this process, to assess \\nthe political, legal and diplomatic operating environment within and across the three \\ncountries and the current state of readiness in key areas related to cross-border dis\\n-aster response (Bookmiller et al, 2017). The following problem statement emerged \\nfrom this\\n analysis:\\nﬁThere exist many different efforts (laws, legal authorities, compacts, memoranda of \\nunderstanding, projects) related to strengthening cross border support during crises \\nin North America. However, there is limited comprehensive understanding of these \\nvarious efforts beyond the entities directly involved in the development and main\\n-tenance of them. The effect of this siloed approach within countries and across the \\nthree countries (Canada, Mexico and the United States) combined with bureaucratic \\nbarriers will impede response efforts particularly during a catastrophic response \\nwhen the rapid ˜ow of humanitarian assistance (professional personnel, equipment \\nand supplies) will be required to save lives and reduce suffering.ﬂ \\nTo start addressing this issue, a series of country-level preparatory meetings were \\nheld to discuss operational response levels with North American disaster response \\npractitioners and policy experts. These dialogues culminated in the North American \\nHumanitarian Response Summit, convened in Washington DC in March 2018. The \\nissues on the table ranged from determining national requirements and triggers for \\naccepting international assistance, to how best to facilitate the cross-border move\\n-ment of goods and personnel, and how to ensure solid accountability\\n measures. \\nThrough this process, a shared commitment was fostered among the regional actors. \\nThe possibility to develop a legally binding regional cooperation agreement was also \\nput on the table, emphasizing the value of regional collaboration in case of disasters \\nŒ and having the necessary legal frameworks to support\\n this. \\nAs National Societies have increased their technical support to the national governments, \\nrequests have likewise increased for more comprehensive advice about how law can best \\naddress the full disaster risk management spectrum. Fr the IFRC partnered \\nwith the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to carry out one of the largest compara\\n-tive studies of law and DRR, looies (IFRC and UNDP, They found \\nResources and time were needed to develop the policies, procedures and mechanisms that \\ndonors have come to expect from their familiar partners, the large international human\\n-itarian organizations. Without capacity investment, many small local actors will struggle \\nto keep up and will be deemed ineligible by donors. If the international community is \\nserious about localization and accountability, it will take real investment and support to \\nlocal actors to develop and implement the necessary policies and\\n procedures.\\n˜˚˙˚˙ Getting the rules right: developments in disaster\\n law \\nLaw can play a fundamental role in the entire disaster risk management spectrum, from \\nensuring that adequate risk reduction measures are in place, such as building codes and \\nland use plans; to outlining clear roles and responsibilities for local actors; and ensur\\n-ing the rights, roles and responsibilities of the most vulnerable people are considered \\nand protected. \\nIFRC research and consultations with responderials around the world have \\nrevealed consistent barriers to e˚ective operations due in large part to the absence of clear \\nnational procedures or regulation. These include unnecessary regulatory bottlenecks to \\nspeedy aid (such as delays with visas, customs and landing rights\\nnational authorities to exercise their leadership and oversight (for example, where inter\\n-national responders fail to coordinate, or provide poor quality aid). Disaster law frame\\n-works are crucial for addressing these issues and for placing authorities in the driver™s\\n seat.November ˙˘ˆ˝ marked ten years since the adoption of the ‚ International Disaster Response \\nLaw (IDRL) guidelines: for the domestic facilitation and regulation of international dis\\n-aster relief and initial recovery assistance™ by the state parties to the Geneva Conventions \\nat the International Conference of Red Cross and Red Crescent. National Societies across \\nthe world have since supported their authorities to implement the recommendations, \\nresulting in new laws and procedures in mories, three regional treaties, \\nand practical support in simulation exercises and operations.\\n While this level of progress appears to compare well with the implementation of simi\\n-lar international guidance documents, it still means that a great many states have yet to \\nadopt comprehensive rules for managing international disaster assistance (IFRC, ˙˘ˆˇc). \\nMoreover, recent research indicates that regulatory problems continue to burden interna\\n-tional operations (ibid). While National Societies and the IFRC remain committed to the \\nslow and steady work of promoting regulatory preparedness in this area, they are also now \\nmore o˜en promoting quicker, less politically heavy approaches, such as national guide\\n-lines, manuals and standard operating procedures, notwithstanding the risk that they may \\nnot be able to override inconsistent laws. Moreover, regional and crosder solutions \\nare starting to show promising results, as Box ˝.˝\\n shows.\\n˚˘. For the latest updates on the dra˜ing and adoption of national disaster laws based on the IDRL Guidelines and other \\nIFRC tools, see the \\ninteractive disaster law\\n map. 209208Disaster trends and IFRC insights\\nthat, in many cases, even in the most recently adopted laws, a focus on DRR has not pen\\n-etrated very deeply and there are still signi˛cant gaps. This is particularly in how DRR is \\naddressed in laws related to urban planning, water use, environment, development plan\\n-ning, and in the clarity of roles and responsibilities across government. Drawing on these \\n˛ndings and extensive consultations, IFRC and UNDP developed a checklist on law and \\ndisaster risk reduction in\\n ˙˘ˆˇ.Another increasing area of concern relates to protection issues in disaster legislation. By \\nway of example, a ˙˘ˆ˝ IFRC study of lawviolence (SGBV) \\nin disasters (IFRC, ˙˘ˆ˝a) found little mention of SGBV in disaster laws and policies, an \\nabsence of coordination between SGBV protection mechanisms and disaster management \\ninstitutions, and little ﬁbusiness continuityﬂ planning for addressing heightened SGBV risks \\nwhen police, courts and support services were themselves impacted by disasters. This and \\nsimilar protection issues are the subject of a new IFRC checklist project now\\n underway. \\n˜˚˙˚ˆ Conclusions \\nThe available data on disasters shows that, notwithstanding advances with DRR, hun\\n-dreds of disasters are still occurring every year, impacting millions of people. The data \\nalso shows the immense human and economic costs imposed by disasters. At the same \\ntime, the data hides some truths Œ the small disasters never captured, the communities \\nnot on the map, the di˚ering experiences of di˚erent communities, the reasons for these \\ndi˚erent\\n experiences. \\nOperationally, National Societies are reaching hundreds of millions of people a˚ected \\nby disasters, in large and small events, all over the world. For its part, IFRC is likewise \\ncontinuing to deploy around the world Œ but a signi˛cant proportion of its appeals and \\ndeployments have to return to the same countries due to a comb \\ncomplexity, fragility and disaster risk. The need for reinforced e˚orts to build community \\nresilience, reduce exposure and reduce risk remains just as urgent as when the last edi\\n-tion of this report raised the issue in\\n At the same time, there is good news to share (and examples to emulate) in concrete steps \\ntowards early action Œ both in cs and epidemics.

In the area of localization of aid, as highlighted in the \\n˙˘ˆˇ edition of this report, very important commitments were undertaken by donors and \\ninternational agencies, but still very slow progress has been made in turning these new \\nattitudes into greater funding, respect and support.\\nSanaa, Yemen,\\n 2017 Yemen Red Crescent (YRCS) water point \\nin Sanaa city centre.

While the groups passed over, and the reasons \\nthey are missed, sometimes change, there are clear common routes to\\n exclusion. \\nThis year™s \\nWorld Disasters Report\\n has looked at the \\npeople who are not seen\\n and who stay \\no˛ the collective radar Œ the hidden people who are undocumented, the places and prob\\n-lems which do not appear in maps, in government or humanitarian databases and people \\nwhose needs are otherwise hidden from humanitarian response. It has sought out some of \\nthe people who are hard to reach \\neven when they are known to be in need, for instance, \\ndue to con˝ict and insecurity, remoteness and/or lack of or destroyed infrastructure. It \\nhas tried to identify some of the \\npeople le˜ out of the loop \\ndue to generic programming \\napproaches, where humanitarians take the easy route, providing assistance in a way that \\nis easiest for the humanitarian sector but that cannot be understood or accessed due to \\nphysical, cultural, social or political\\n limitations.The report has also looked at more intentional areas of exclusion. It has sought to highlight \\nthe people who are not prioritized for funding \\nwhen resources are limited, o˚en because \\nthey are absent from the media and donor spotlight. And, related both to the current con\\n-versations around bridging the gaps between development, humanitarian and peacebuild\\n-ing work and to a more traditional and limited assessment of the scope of humanitarian \\naction, there are the \\npeople seen as out of scope. \\nPeople who are not seen as humanitar\\n-ians™ problem, even though they have very clear needs Œ sometimes of the same scale and \\nseverity as the people who humanitarians do consider their ‚caseload™. \\nEach chapter has put forward a series of detailed recommendations that the International \\nFederation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) calls on policy˙makers and \\nhumanitarian actors to take up. In this section, we (the IFRC) propose some overall con\\n-clusions and recommendations. While many of the recommendations throughout this \\nreport are just as applicable to the IFRC and its members as to our partners, we will also \\ntake speci˜c note here of some of our own commitments for\\n action.Adopting the goal: deciding to leave no one\\n behindThe Sustinable Development Goals™ commitment to ‚leave no one behind™ can be the ral\\n-lying call for collective action that meets the needs of all people a˛ected by crises, but \\nhumanitarianism™s own bedrock principles, particularly humanity and impartiality, have \\nlong established a similar\\n imperative. \\n213\\n ŠPrioritize and incentivize the people hardest to reach with proactive and tailored \\nstrategies and tools, such as through allocating funds speci˜cally for the under-\\nsupported and hardest˙to˙reach groups (bearing in mind the overall goal of serving the \\npeople most in need, whether they are easy or diˆcult to help).\\n ŠRemove disincentives to working in hard˙to˙reach areas, including bluntly designed \\ncounter˙terrorism regulations that criminalize principled humanitarian action, \\nrequiring the presence of foreign humanitarian workers when local responders can \\nadequately carry out programmes, and the adoption of approaches that shi˚ risk down \\nthe implementation chain rather than sharing and jointly mitigating the risks necessary \\nto meeting the needs of people being le˚\\n behind. \\nAll governments:\\n ŠAdopt laws, rules and procedures both to facilitate international disaster response \\noperations and to promote adequate quality\\n standards. \\n ŠEnsure that their laws, procedures and personnel guarantee humanitarian organizations™ \\naccess to all people in need. This includes ensuring that anti˙smuggling and anti-\\ntraˆcking laws and related measures do not criminalize principled humanitarian \\nassistance to vulnerable\\n migrants.\\n ŠDraw attention to, and insist that international responders also take into account, the \\nneeds of people in hard˙to˙reach\\n areas.\\nHumanitarian\\n organizations: \\n ŠSystematically integrate steps to support people hardest to reach into their appeals and \\nresponse plans, including, where necessary, prioritizing mobilizing funds to mitigate any \\nsecurity risks (both for themselves and their local\\n partners)\\nThe IFRC™s\\n commitment: ŠThe IFRC commits to prioritizing support to people most in need in its own \\noperations, regardless of the diˆculty in reaching them, including by orienting our \\nneeds assessment guidance (currently under revision) toward identifying the people \\nmost in need, and by highlighting them in our\\n appeals.Recognizing and supporting the role of local humanitarian\\n actionLocal responders have an enormous potential to reduce gaps across nearly every aspect \\nof exclusion examined in this report. They are o˚en the only ones able to reach people \\nin remote or insecure areas. Local associations for women, for persons with disabilities, \\nand for older people (such as Afghanistan™s grandmothers™ committees), bring unique \\nIn reality, humanitarian action is fundamentally about triage Œ and with increases in global \\nrisks and constraints on resources and access, humanitarians will never have the capac\\n-ity to address all needs arising from con˝icts and disasters. Yet they can and should go \\nbeyond the people most visible, most convenient, easiest to reach, simplest to programme \\nfor and who neatly ˜t the response\\n model. \\nCertainly, it will not always be the case that resources and e˛orts should be prioritized to \\nserve the ‚expensive few™ people when also faced with the equally a˛ected ‚many™. However, \\nit will sometimes be the right thing to do and, at a minimum, choices must be made in a \\nmore conscious and transparent\\n way. \\nMoreover, it \\nis always the case that humanitarian action should try to prioritize the people \\nmost in need, regardless of the expense or challenges of reaching them Œ yet the sector \\ncan hardly do so if it is unaware, wilfully ignorant or unadaptable. As described in Chapter \\nˇ ‚out of scope™, moreover, humanitarians must be ready and open to ˜nding the peo\\n-ple most in need wherever they may be, including in non˙traditional settings and\\n crises.\\nIdeas have power and if there is sector˙wide acceptance of leaving no one behind as a cen\\n-tral goal, the notion will generate more of the good practice and commitment to change \\nshowcased throughout this report. Consciously adopting this goal, therefore, is the ˜rst \\nrecommendation, to all in the sector. However, success will also depend on some systemic \\ntransformations, some of which are already on the table in current policy debates, and \\nsome of which are not. Both kinds are examined in greater detail\\n here.\\nGetting the incentives\\n rightThe next step is fortifying the good intentions around leaving no one behind with the \\nright incentives. Many people being le˚ behind are missing out for a reason: it is o˚en \\nharder, more expensive and riskier to go the last mile to ˜nd and serve them. Maximum \\nmedia coverage, minimum cost per person reached, and the smoothest political sailing are \\no˚en best guaranteed to people who stay close to the capitals and away from disfavoured \\npopulations. At the other extreme, the criminalization of aid, such as in over˙broad coun\\n-ter˙terrorism, money laundering or anti˙smuggling laws, and (to a lesser extent) bureau\\n-cratic barriers to the entry of relief personnel and goods or to the funding of local respond\\n-ers, can have a signi˜cant chilling\\n e˛ect.Transforming these skewed incentives will require real commitment and investment, as \\nwell as speci˜c policy changes from key actors across the\\n sector. \\nThe IFRC therefore recommends\\n that:Donors: ŠDe˜ne ‚value for money™ in light of the goal of leaving no one behind, seeking the most \\neˆcient approach that successfully reaches the people most in need Œ even if they are \\nmore expensive to serve than\\n others. \\n214215Conclusion\\nHumanitarian\\n organizations:\\n ŠStrengthen their partnerships with local responders, with a conscious goal of devolving \\ndecision˙making and nurturing long˙term\\n capacity.\\n ŠFind ways to better integrate local knowledge (in particular about cultural issues, \\nhidden vulnerability and local capacities) into needs assessments, in particular through \\ninvesting in pre˙disaster mapping exercises with local partners in disaster˙prone\\n states.The IFRC™s\\n commitment: ŠThe IFRC commits to continue to strengthen its investment in the operational and \\nfunctional capacity of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies as frontline \\nresponders to support their delivery of relevant service. This will include cooperating \\nwith ICRC to build a new ‚National Society Investment Alliance™: a pooled fund for \\nsigni˜cant, ˝exible, multi˙year ˜nancing, and support to National Societies™ long-\\nterm\\n sustainability. \\n ŠThe IFRC commits to continue to strengthen its support to National Societies to \\nadvise and assist their governments in developing e˛ective laws, procedures and \\nmechanisms for facilitating and regulating international\\n assistance.\\nAdopting a community-centred, participatory\\n approach \\nTo avoid misunderstanding priority needs and missing people who need help, the human\\n-itarian sector also needs to scale up the implementation of previous commitments (such \\nas those in the Grand Bargain) around the participation of a˛ected communities, in par\\n-ticular community members who might otherwise be passed\\n over. \\nDespite excellent intentions across the sector, communities continue to report that they \\nare not well informed on how to access support, do not feel able to participate in deci\\n-sions that a˛ect them and do not feel the aid they receive is relevant to them (Ground \\nTruth, \\nThe IFRC therefore recommends that:Humanitarian\\n organizations \\n ŠPrioritize integrating community participation Œ with particular attention to groups \\nlikely to be passed over, such as women, older people and persons with disabilities Œ in \\nall areas of programming, ideally before, but at least from the very beginning of a crisis. \\nFeedback should be shared more e˛ectively across aid organizations so that all actors \\nare aware and able to respond to community\\n concerns. \\n ŠRethink needs assessment methods and approaches to make sure that these seek out \\nand ˜nd the people most in need, even if they are not in ‚traditional™ categories, and \\nadequately value the preferences of a˛ected people themselves when prioritizing\\n needs. \\nperspective on how these populations may be a˛ected and how aid e˛orts may miss their \\nparticular needs. Local organizations can also bring an understanding about populations \\nwhose su˛ering may be hidden, that outsiders\\n lack. \\nOf course, local responders are not perfect Œ like their international counterparts, they have \\nbiases and blind spots; they make assumptions and mistakes. But at the moment, inter\\n-national investment in their areas of strength Œ and support to overcome areas of weak\\n-ness and special risk (particularly in dangerous areas) Œ remains extremely poor, notwith\\n-standing commitments to the contrary, such as in the Grand Bargain. The share of total \\ninternational humanitarian assistance provided directly to local and national responders \\n(as reported in OCHA™s ˜nancial tracking system) has increased fr\\nUS dollarsllarsDevelopment Initiatives, \\n still a far cry from the Grand Bargain™s tarhannelled as directly as \\npossible by Moreover, while there have been encouraging signs of progress among \\na number of UN agencies and international NGOs, interships still \\ntend toward one˙way, extractive relationships which fail to take best advantage of local \\nknowledge or strengthen longer˙term local\\n capacity.\\nThe IFRC therefore recommends that:Donors: ŠInvest in local responders, in particular their long˙term institutional capacities, in \\nline with high ambitions of the Grand Bargain and its tarnational \\n˜nancing to be channelled as directly as possible to them by Investment can and \\nshould include support to develop and implement policies and procedures around \\ncapacity development for management of international funds, fraud, accountability and \\nsafeguarding as well as to ensure safety of\\n sta˛.\\n ŠInvest in national governments™ capacity to adequately facilitate and regulate \\ninternational assistance, to ensure their primary role in coordination and to avoid \\nunnecessary bureaucratic barriers, as well as to enhance their accountability for the use \\nof funds deployed to support their\\n populations. \\nGovernments:\\n ŠInvest their own resources in local response capacities, including those of civil \\nsociety, at the domestic level, to reduce reliance on international funding. This should \\ninclude developing the necessary laws and procedures to facilitate and regulate \\ninternational\\n assistance.\\n ŠWelcome and allow international investment in local capacities, including those of civil \\nsociety, actively seeking it out when they feel that their own resources are not great \\nenough to address the\\n risks. \\n216217\\nConclusion\\nWhile it is of course true that ‚pure™ development institutions have an indispensable role \\nto play (which some, such as the World Bank, are making important steps to take up), for \\nmany of the international stakeholders, the divisions are internal and self˙imposed. The \\nconceptual and administrative bifurcations between resilience building and response only \\nexacerbate the negative dispersal of the responsibility that both agencies and donors have \\nfor people le˚ exposed to\\n risk. \\nThe IFRC therefore recommends that:All governments (including donors) and humanitarian\\n organizations:\\n ŠMove toward tallying and reviewing coverage of ‚appeals™ for emergencies and resilience-\\nbuilding side by side, thus ensuring that success is judged on the overall degree to \\nwhich human su˛ering has been prevented (as a preference) or reduced (where needed).\\n ŠInvest much more heavily in community resilience and local response capacities before \\ndisasters and other\\n crises.\\n ŠSeize the ‚low˙hanging fruit™ of anticipatory funding for predictable and recurrent \\nhazards, including scaling up the success demonstrated in instruments such as \\nforecast˙based ˜nancing, and promoting its use both in international and domestic \\nresponse\\n systems. \\n ŠPromote legal and policy frameworks for disaster risk management that focus on the \\nneeds of the most vulnerable\\n people.\\nDonors: ŠBreak down the arti˜cially created silos between their own development, climate \\nand humanitarian funding structures that leave resilience, local capacity support and \\ndevelopment, and preparedness chronically\\n underfunded.\\n ŠWhen requested, fund humanitarian organizations for activities related to building \\nresilience, even if these might traditionally be seen as development oriented, and seek \\nout alternative providers when humanitarians feel that they cannot undertake\\n them. \\nHumanitarian\\n organizations:\\n ŠSystematically include resilience strengthening in their interventions, even if they \\nare of a type traditionally considered ‚development™ rather than ‚humanitarian™, unless \\nthey lack the relevant competence or capacity or such activity would undermine their \\ncompliance with humanitarian\\n principles.\\n ŠActively seek relevant information on needs, capacities, vulnerabilities and perspectives \\nin the preparedness phase before disasters strike. This includes researching how best to \\ncommunicate with members of communities (including languages and literacy levels). \\nDonors:  ŠEnsure ˝exibility in how funds are allocated to programmes throughout a crisis so that \\nprogramme courses can be corrected based on feedback from\\n communities. \\n ŠPrioritize resources for community engagement activities and make community \\nengagement and response a clear expectation of all grant recipients and a component of \\nmonitoring and\\n evaluation. \\nThe IFRC™s\\n commitment: ŠThe IFRC commits to strengthening its community engagement and accountability, \\nincluding through developing minimum standards in this area for the International \\nRed Cross and Red Crescent\\n Movement.\\n ŠThe IFRC commits to ensuring greater use of the outcomes of vulnerability and \\ncapacity assessments in response programming including through developing an online \\nrepository for\\n these. \\nTaking up our part of the responsibility for\\n resilience \\nAs noted in the introduction, humanitarian agencies Œ and their donors Œ have tradition\\n-ally seen themselves as the last resort Œ waiting to act only a˚er crises have overwhelmed \\nlocal resources and then only to reduce their worst impacts. However, nearlyyears on \\nfrom the proclamation of the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction, this lim\\n-ited view no longer adequately describes the humanitarian sector™s role or\\n responsibility. \\nWithout investments in risk reduction, in community resilience, and in anticipatory \\napproaches, many people will continue to be le˚ behind. As reported in the \\nWorld Disasters \\nReport ˜˚˛˝\\n, the case for this approach was made and globally accepted long ago. Yet the \\npractice remains far from what should be expected. Funding for disaster risk reduction \\nremains negligible as a proportion of dev\\n-cial development as the most recently available\\n ˜gures. \\nUnsurprisingly, whereas the overwhelming majority of ‚humanitarian™ organizations are \\n(or are fast becoming) ‚double hatted™ with regard to emergency and development activ\\n-ities, the lopsided nature of international funding means that activities actually remain \\nstrongly response focused. While risk reduction work is arguably much more e˛ective in \\nsaving lives than post˙crisis assistance, there is a lack of corresponding urgency about cov\\n-erage gaps in this area, and they are not as systematically illustrated as those regularly tal\\n-lied for emergency\\n appeals. \\n218219\\nConclusion\\nThe IFRC therefore recommends that:All governments (including donors) and humanitarian\\n organizations:\\n ŠInvest in much stronger data gathering and analysis capacities across the humanitarian \\nsector and at the national level, with a focus on ˜nding people and needs who might be \\nout of sight Œ in particularly older people and persons with\\n disabilities. \\n ŠEnsure that there is agreement on basic data standards and methodology to ensure \\ncomparability and\\n interoperability.\\n ŠMake sure that data actually underlies decision˙making, including by developing \\nwidespread internal digital literacy within their organizations in addition to digital \\n‚infrastructure™\\n investments.\\n ŠResist an exclusive reliance on data or technical modelling to understand the \\ncomplexities of di˛erent\\n contexts. ŠEnsure a strong ‚do˙no˙harm™ approach to data protection and\\n sharing.\\nDonors: ŠMake sure that the results of these investments are accessible to the variety of \\nstakeholders, including local responders and that gathering data does not become an \\nend in itself Œ an activity that replaces rather than stimulates action (as seems to be the \\ncase for urban violence and irregular migration).\\nThe IFRC™s\\n commitment: ŠThe IFRC commits to continue to invest in its own, and its members™, capacity to \\ngather and analyse relevant data designed to determine whom is most in need and \\nto detect anyone who might be le˚ behind. This will include building our own data \\nliteracy, consistently gathering sex, age and disability˙disaggregated data, and increasing \\nparticipation in open source approaches to data sharing in the\\n sector.\\n ŠThe IFRC commits to promoting the use of data to strengthen community˙level \\nresilience building and response activities, without displacing direct action with \\ndata gathering. \\nThe IFRC™s\\n commitment: ŠThe IFRC commits to continuing its support for resilience building, including, where \\npossible, through inclusion of relevant activities in emergency\\n operations.\\n ŠThe IFRC commits to supporting National Societies to strengthen community \\nresilience, regardless of whether it is considered ‚humanitarian™ or ‚development™ \\nin nature. \\n ŠThe IFRC commits to continue its support for the development of legislative and \\npolicy frameworks for disaster risk management and climate change adaptation focused \\non resilience\\n approaches.\\nImproving appropriate use of data and\\n technology\\nData has a transformative potential for ensuring that no one is le˚ behind. Indeed, it will \\nbe impossible to know if the goal of leaving no one behind has been reached without a \\nstronger use of this critical tool. Data Œ particularly properly disaggregated data -- also \\nhas a unique potential to expose hidden trends and problems that might lead to groups \\nof people being le˚ behind. Likewise, new technologies provide incredible opportunities \\nto address many of these\\n gaps. \\nRelying on data and technology has its risks, however. Poor understandings of the gaps \\nin data sets can give misleading impressions and paper over rather than reveal gap areas. \\nPoorly protected and poorly conceived data initiatives can expose vulnerable people to \\nnew forms of harm. Likewise, excessive reliance on technological solutions such as drones \\nand satellite information risks displacing human\\n engagement.220221Conclusion\\ncommits to support its members to strengthen their services to migrants and to build \\nunderstandings with their authorities about their role and contributions. The IFRC \\nfurther commits to supporting members to develop activities, promote non˙violence \\nand address the impacts of urban violence, such as psychological\\n trauma.\\nRecognizing there will always be unmet needs and humanitarians will constantly strug\\n-gle to ˜ll the gaps, the sector regardless needs to do better at meeting the most urgent \\nneeds. This report has tried to explore what we as humanitarians, but also in partner\\n-ship with others, can do to better leave no one behind. Most importantly it has sought to \\nchallenge all those engaged in humanitarian action Œ the donors, the multilateral, inter\\n-national, national and local service providers Œ to constantly seek to identify the people \\nmost in need and hardest to reach, to identify people who may be excluded for all of the \\nreasons outlined here, and more, to make these people the top priority. It is time we all \\nmake real the pledge of making the last mile the ˜rst\\n mile. \\n ŠThe IFRC commits to developing and implementing appropriate data protection and \\nprivacy policies and to support its members to do the\\n same.Addressing the critical\\n cases \\nThis report has raised various examples in its discussion of the question of leaving no one \\nbehind. However, they have not been raised here merely as illustrations, but rather as crit\\n-ical cases of neglect that require immediate attention in light of this global goal. Some \\ncritical cases include people lacking formal identi˜cation papers or property title, peo\\n-ple vulnerable to sexual and gender˙based violence, older people and persons with dis\\n-abilities, irregular migrants and people su˛ering from elevated urban violence. None of \\nthese cases are particularly new Œ the gaps have been amply signalled in the past Œ now \\nis the time to act on them.The IFRC therefore recommends that:All governments (including donors) and humanitarian\\n organizations:\\n ŠGuard against blind spots in assistance for people lacking government˙issued \\nidenti˜cation, people without formal title to their homes, whose communities are not \\nmapped, and who silently endure elevated risks of sexual and gender˙based violence. \\nThis will require greater e˛orts to understand where and how these gaps are likely to \\noccur, for example, through advance mapping of national laws related to housing, land \\nand property rights (as the Australian Red Cross is currently leading in the Paci˜c), and \\nproactive e˛orts to train and prepare humanitarian personnel to ask the right questions. \\nFor its part, the IFRC commits to supporting these e˛orts and to continue its work \\nwith National Societies to reduce and prepare for sexual and gender˙based violence \\nrisks in disaster\\n settings. ŠEnsure that humanitarian budgets, plans and ˜nancing incorporate speci˜c allocations \\nand programmes to reach out to older people and persons with disabilities, improving \\nthe quality and sharing of data gathered about them. Humanitarian organizations in \\nparticular should work harder to ensure a strong role for older people and persons with \\ndisabilities themselves in decision˙making, including through partnering with dedicated \\nlocal organizations, where they exist. For its part, the IFRC commits to partnering \\nwith organizations of older people and of persons with disabilities and to developing \\nnetwork˙wide disaggregated data on IFRC and National Society\\n programming.\\n ŠAcknowledge that the su˛ering of irregular migrants and of people experiencing \\nurban violence in many parts of the world have already reached levels rendering them \\nhumanitarian crises and that investment is made accordingly.

It coveries \\nand produces a composite indicator of risk of humanitarian crisis and disaster that would \\noverwhelm national response capacity. It centres on three main dimensions of risk: occur\\n-rences of, and exposure to, natural and human hazard events; vulnerability (the suscep\\n-tibility of communities to these hazards); and lack of coping capacity (lack of resources \\nthat can alleviate the impact). \\nFull details and methodology are available from the \\nINFORM Index\\n website. \\nFragile states\\nThis report references the ˘ˆ fragile states published in the OECD™s \\nStates of Fragility ˜˚˛˝: \\nUnderstanding\\n Violence\\n.229Data on the number of peopy a disaster is sometimes poorly reported, and \\nde˜nitions vary.\\nData on damage costs is only reported for a small number of events. Only\\nal hazards recorded betwsociated data on dam\\n-ages. In terms of value, amounts are driven by losses in wealthier countries where both \\nasset values and insurance penetration are higher. \\nreported damage related to disasters in Africa,Americas,Asia, ˆ.ˆ% \\nin Europe,Oceania. This underestimates the loss Œ and ongoing economic \\nimpact Œ in poor countries, where values of physical assets are low and/or may remain pri\\n-vate and unreported. It also underestimates the loss or impact of certain types of disaster, \\nsuch as droughts, where these occur in lower income/low insurance penetration\\n countries. \\nFor a disaster to be entered into the EM˚DAT database, at least one of the following cri\\n-teria must be\\n ful˜lled: Šten or more people reported\\n killed Š˙˝˝ or more people reported\\n  Šdeclaration of a state of\\n emergency\\n Šcall for international\\n assistance.\\nData is in current prices (US dollars).\\nFurther information available from \\nEM˚DAT\\n.IFRC GOSee IFRC\\n GO.was downloaded from \\nIFRC GO Historic appeals\\n and DREFs dashboard  \\non ˙˝ February and from \\nIFRC GO Appeals and DREFs dashboard\\n on ˙˘ February\\n Data relating to ongowas downloaded on ˇ April\\n They are: Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, \\nCentral African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Côte d™Ivoire, DPRK, Democratic Republic of \\nthe Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea˚Bissau, Haiti, \\nHonduras, Iraq, Kenya, Lao People™s Democratic Republic, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, \\nMadagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, occu\\n-pied Palestinian territory,\\n˙ Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, \\nSierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Syria, \\nTajikistan, Tanzania, Timor˚Leste, Uganda, Venezuela,, Yemen, Zambia and\\n Zimbabwe.\\n RegionsThe regional classi˜cation of countries can vary by institution.

Its purpose is to protect life and health and to \\nensure respect for the human being. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, \\ncooperation and lasting peace amongst all\\n peoples. \\nImpartiality\\n˜It makes no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, \\nclass or political opinions. It endeavours to relieve the su˛ering of individuals, being \\nguided solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most urgent cases of\\n distress. \\nNeutrality˜In order to enjoy the con˚dence of all, the Movement may not take \\nsides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious \\nor ideological\\n nature. \\nIndependence˜The Movement is independent. The National Societies, while \\nauxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the laws \\nof their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may \\nbe able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the\\n Movement. \\nVoluntary service\\n It is a voluntary relief movement not prompted in any manner \\nby desire for\\n gain. \\nUnity\\n There can be only one Red Cross or Red Crescent Society in any one country. \\nIt must be open to all.

And behind \\n\\nevery statistic, there is a human \\n\\nbeing and his or her story. \\nThis Annual Report details our \\nadvocacy in 2018, from our efforts \\n\\nto protect the dignity and right to \\n\\nessential services of migrants on \\n\\nthe move, to the very worrying \\nMESSAGE FROM THE \\nSECRETARY GENERAL\\nfindings of our World Disasters \\n\\nReport that millions of people who \\n\\nneed humanitarian aid are not \\n\\ngetting it. The report then sets out \\n\\nour prescriptions and best practice \\n\\non how better to reach them. We \\n\\nmeet these people at their point of \\n\\nneed, and our work is needed more \\n\\nthan ever.\\nSo, the report charts how the \\nIFRC, its 190-member National Red \\n\\nCross and Red Crescent Societies \\n\\nand nearly 14 million volunteers, \\n\\nrose to meet these challenges by \\n\\nbringing hope and help to vulner\\n-able people all over the world.\\nThey helped build resilience, \\nand provided care, support and \\n\\nprotection.\\nNational Societies are embedded \\nin local communities: they are \\n\\nthere before, during and after cri\\n-ses; they have a stake in a joint \\n\\nfuture; they are trusted to help.\\n\\nThey are local actors \\npar excellence.\\nThe wider network therefore plays \\na critical global and local role. That \\n\\nis why we were asked to champion \\n\\nthe cause of bringing more support \\n\\nand more funding to local actors \\n\\nwithin the Grand Bargain pro\\n-cess which came out of the World \\n\\nHumanitarian Summit in 2016.\\nThe Report tells how, in 2018, we \\nwere able to deliver critical fund\\n-ing through 14 new Emergency \\n\\nAppeals and 31 ongoing ones \\n\\nworth a collective CHF 730 million \\n\\nand targeting 21 million people.\\nWe allocated a near-record CHF \\n23.8 million from the Disaster \\n\\nRelief Emergency Fund to almost \\n\\n100 different operations and \\n\\ninvested more than CHF 250 mil\\n-lion in Disaster Risk Reduction \\n\\nprojects across the IFRC network.\\nThe chapters to follow paint a \\n\\npicture of our work in the face of \\n\\nindividual disasters like the Ebola \\n\\noutbreak in the DRC, and the tri\\n-ple tragedies of earthquake and \\n\\ntsunami in Indonesia. They look \\n\\nat our four overarching strategies, \\n\\nand at our work by both area of \\n\\nfocus and region.\\nTogether, we reached millions of \\npeople with vital services, includ\\n-ing 48 million people with health \\n\\nservices and more than 8 mil\\n-lion with disaster risk reduction \\n\\nactivities.\\nWe continued to help to equip \\nand empower National Societies \\n\\nto respond more effectively. We \\n\\nhelped to shape and influence \\n\\npolicy with partners across \\n\\nall sectors, while building a \\n\\nFederation ˜t for the future.\\nThanks to the continued strong \\nsupport of our donors, especially \\n\\nthrough the contribution of une\\n-armarked funding, we have made \\n\\nsigni˜cant progress in responding \\n\\nto the increasing scale and the \\n\\nevolution of humanitarian crises.\\nThank you to all who have contrib\\n-uted not just to this publication, \\nbut to a global debate of profound \\n\\nimportance. Let™s never lose sight \\n\\nof the people whom it is our privi\\n-lege to serve.\\nSituational Analysis\\nIn 2018, the IFRC NetworkŠ190 National Red Cross and Red \\nCrescent Societies and their secretariatŠwas called on to respond \\nto many new crises and record levels of humanitarian needs. More \\nextreme climate-related events occurred than ever before and the \\nconsequences of complex protracted humanitarian crises were felt \\nin all regions.\\nIn response to several natural disasters in Indonesia, the IFRC \\nNetwork aligned its support to the local National Society, Palang \\nMerah Indonesia (PMI), playing a crucial role in response to the cri\\n-ses in line with international assistance restrictions imposed by the \\nGovernment of Indonesia. The IFRC Network demonstrated its com\\n-mitment towards greater localization which is becoming a model \\nfor other countries.\\nMeanwhile, The IFRC Network continued to respond to large scale \\nprotracted humanitarian crises such as those in Syria, Yemen and \\nAfghanistan and the increasing number of people in Bangladesh \\nin Cox™s Bazar. The IFRC Network also responded to the Ebola out\\n-break in the Equateur and North Kivu Provinces of the Democratic \\nRepublic of Congo and provided support to neighbouring countries \\nto limit the danger of the disease spreading across borders.\\nSuch extremes in an age of technological advancement, rising \\nresources and increasing efforts highlight the contradictions and \\ncomplexities faced by the humanitarian community. Since 2017, \\nthe world has been facing one of the largest food crises in decades. \\nMeanwhile, 1.9 billion people, more than a quarter of the world™s \\npopulation, are considered overweight or obese.\\nThe identi˜cation, analysis, and monitoring of people affected by \\ncrises may be faster and more effective as a result of the so-called \\nFourth Industrial Revolution. However, people in dire need are still \\nbeing left behind, as reported in IFRC™s 2018 World Disasters Report. \\nDespite an increase in resources, the gap between humanitarian \\nneeds and available resources continues to grow. Greater recogni\\n-tion for the value of disaster risk reduction, preventative action and \\npreparedness have led to substantial dividends but these activities \\ncontinue to be dif˜cult to fund.\\nSITUATIONAL ANALYSIS\\nAs negotiations took place on a Global \\nCompact for Safe, Orderly and Regular \\nMigration and a Global Compact for \\nRefugees, and the international community \\nre-emphasised the importance of ˜nding \\ndurable solutions, millions of people dis\\n-placed by conflict and natural disasters \\nfaced increasing hostility. In addition, the pat\\n-terns of human mobility, displacement, and \\nmigration are changing and pose their own \\nchallenges.\\nSocial and demographic changes across the \\nworld are placing severe pressure on already \\nstretched and fragile health systems as they \\nreact to the cost of aging populations, the per\\n-sistence of disease epidemics such as malaria and \\nthe increasing prevalence of non-communicable \\ndiseases. The world continues to grapple with \\nsystematic gaps in the universal coverage of \\nhealthcare and basic services and a shortage \\nof quali˜ed medical staff. There is also still poor \\naccess to formal health systems, inadequate cov\\n-erage of safe water and sanitation, and a limited \\ncapacity of many governments to prepare for, detect \\nand respond to pandemics.\\nWhile the transformation of the humanitarian \\ncommunity is taking time, National Societies have \\ndemonstrated unparalleled access when assisting the \\nmost isolated and vulnerable people through their net\\n-works of volunteers and with the support of the IFRC \\non the ground. As auxiliaries to their public authori\\n-ties and with the ability to draw on a global experience \\n\\nthrough the IFRC, National Societies have been in \\na unique position to provide life-saving assistance, \\nstrengthen individual and community resilience, and \\nin˚uence domestic policy and practice. Many National \\nSocieties are strong and stable, but in 2018 others required \\nthe support of the rest of the Network and the dedicated \\nlong-term support of the IFRC to reach their full potential.\\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \\n Annual Report 2018\\nThe Grand Bargain has brought new oppor\\n-tunities and raised expectations, such as the \\ncommitment to ﬁmake principled humanitarian \\naction as local as possible and as international as \\nnecessaryﬂ, through increasing support and invest\\n-ment to local and national responders. The IFRC \\nis co-convening the Grand Bargain™s Localization \\nWork-stream, to support donors, agencies and local \\nactors to put the commitments into action. The IFRC \\nis also at the core of the inter-agency push towards \\nthe more effective participation of people affected \\nby crises in humanitarian decisions. Ensuring com\\n-munity engagement and accountability is both an \\noperational imperative and an ethical responsibility, \\nwhich is key to sustainability.\\nThese are just a few examples of local and global \\nchallenges that the IFRC Network faced in 2018. New \\nstrategies and partnerships are needed to adapt and \\nevolve quickly and effectively so that people who most \\nneed support receive it in the right way and at the right \\ntime. The IFRC is well-positioned, building on the strengths \\nof its global network, with the dedication of millions of vol\\n-unteers and the commitment of staff working with National \\nSocieties, to represent their voices and, in turn in˚uence \\nglobal and local policy. With the continued support of its \\npartners, the IFRC will continue to support this transforma\\n-tion with the collective power and in˚uence of the network.\\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \\n Annual Report 2018\\nThe Unique IFRC Value\\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and \\nRed Crescent Societies (IFRC) is the world™s largest \\nvolunteer-based humanitarian network with reach \\nthat is truly local and global.\\nWe work to support vulnerable communities in a way \\nthat is effective, consistent and relevant.\\nOur strength lies in our volunteer network, our \\ncommunity-based expertise, the collective impact of a \\nglobal network, and our independence and neutrality.\\nIt is rooted in communities and supported globally \\nand provides life-saving assistance to even the most \\nremote communities.\\nWe act before, during and after disasters and health \\nemergencies to meet the needs and improve the lives \\nof vulnerable people. We do so with impartiality as to \\nnationality, race, gender, religious beliefs, class and \\npolitical opinions. Our collective strategy to tackle \\nthe major humanitarian and development challenges \\ndemonstrates our commitment to saving lives and \\nchanging minds.\\nWe work to improve humanitarian standards, as part\\n-ners in development, and in response to disasters. We \\npersuade decision-makers to act at all times in the \\ninterests of vulnerable people.\\nThe result: we enable healthy and safe communities, \\nreduce vulnerabilities, strengthen resilience and fos\\n-ter a culture of peace around the world.\\nWith our 190 member \\nNational Red Cross and \\nRed Crescent Societies \\nworldwide, our network is \\nthe epitome of localization \\nin humanitarian assistance. \\nABOUT THE IFRC\\nThe IFRC™s Strategies \\n for Implementation \\n and Areas of Focus\\nThe IFRC™s programme priorities in 2018 were driven \\nby the Plan and Budget 2016Œ2020 adopted by the IFRC \\nGeneral Assembly in 2015. This determines how the \\nIFRC works in support of its members through four \\ndistinct Strategies for Implementation and seven \\nAreas of Focus.\\nThe Strategies for Implementation are the critical \\nfunctions of the IFRC that are designed to support \\nNational Societies to implement their effective pro\\n-grammes. The Areas of Focus are the areas where \\nIFRC works with National Societies to deliver results \\nfor vulnerable communities.\\nAbout the IFRC\\nSupporting vulnerable \\ncommunities before, \\nduring, and after disasters\\nBefore\\nRisk reduction, resilience \\n\\nand healthy communities\\nDuring\\nLifesaving assistance\\nAfter\\nRecovery\\n\\n\\ndecision making\\nHumanitarian \\n\\nstandards\\nPolicies\\nLocal voices in \\n\\nglobal discussions\\n190 National Societies\\nIFRC\\n13.7 million volunteers\\nROOTED IN COMMUNITIES\\nStrengthen National \\nSocietiesThe IFRC has long been recognized as \\nan advocate for localization because \\n\\nof its efforts to strengthen National \\n\\nSocieties, and it is a co-leader of \\n\\nthe Grand Bargain Workstream on \\n\\nlocalization. National Societies are \\n\\ncritical local actors. Many are strong, \\n\\naccountable organizations, but others \\n\\nrequire support in their development. \\n\\nThe IFRC supports these National \\n\\nSocieties to evolve into more effective \\n\\norganizations and to be better \\n\\nable to prepare for the future and \\n\\nsupport vulnerable communities.\\nThe IFRC also facilitates access and \\nprovides National Societies with \\n\\ntechnical expertise and resources. It \\n\\nsupports them with innovation, such \\n\\n\\n\\nprovides training and helps them \\n\\nto evaluate and learn from their \\n\\nwork and that of the network.\\nEnsure Effective \\nInternational Disaster \\n\\nManagement\\nCoordination among the members \\nof the IFRC Network is a central \\n\\nfunction of the IFRC. It collaborates \\n\\nclosely within the Movement and \\n\\nwider humanitarian community \\n\\non emergency preparedness, \\n\\ndisaster response and recovery.\\nThe IFRC sets humanitarian standards \\nand guidelines, and mobilizes and \\n\\ncoordinates humanitarian relief \\n\\nassistance funds and expertise for \\n\\nNational Societies. When needed, it \\n\\nprovides procurement and supply \\n\\nchain management support and, to \\n\\n\\n\\nlarge-scale operations, encourages the \\n\\nsharing of needs assessments, situation \\n\\nanalyses, and operational planning \\n\\nand monitoring. When needs surpass \\n\\nlocal capacity, the IFRC can mobilize \\n\\nthe network. The IFRC™s regional, \\n\\n\\n\\nalso advise and assist National Societies \\n\\nwith relief operations, development \\n\\nprogrammes and regional cooperation.\\nSTRATEGIES FOR \\nIMPLEMENTATION\\nAbout the IFRC\\n\\nLeading Strategic \\n\\nPartners\\nThe IFRC network is recognized as a \\ncritical strategic partner within the \\n\\nhumanitarian community. It has the \\n\\n\\n\\nhumanitarian debates and to mobilize \\n\\ngreater and more diverse resources. \\n\\nThe IFRC represents National Societies \\n\\nin global discussions to promote \\n\\nresilience, and develops guidance \\n\\nand tools for use at the local, national \\n\\nand international levels, to give a \\n\\nglobal voice to the concerns of its \\n\\nmembership, and, through them, \\n\\nto the needs and concerns of the \\n\\nworld™s most vulnerable people.\\nEnsure a Strong IFRC \\nthat is Effective, Credible \\n\\nand Accountable\\nImplementing its priorities requires \\nthe IFRC to perform to the highest \\n\\nstandards, to be relevant and credible, \\n\\nto represent and work towards the \\n\\ncollective interests of the membership, \\n\\nas well as provide its members with \\n\\nrelevant and valued services. The IFRC \\n\\ntherefore works to ensure that its \\n\\nmanagement structure and matrix \\n\\nmanagement are effective and \\n\\n\\n\\napproach improving transparency \\n\\nand accountability, mitigating risks of \\n\\nfraud and corruption, and enhancing \\n\\nquality of service and value for \\n\\nmoney for itself and its members.\\nDisaster Risk \\nReduction\\nThe IFRC provides support for \\ndisaster risk reduction activities \\n\\ndesigned to strengthen the \\n\\ncapacity of National Societies \\n\\nand to increase the ability of \\n\\nlocal communities, especially \\n\\n\\n\\n(1BC), to prepare for and \\n\\nrespond to disasters. The work \\n\\naddresses a variety of threats \\n\\nranging from natural hazards, \\n\\n\\n\\nto technological hazards and \\n\\nespecially extreme weather \\n\\nevents due to climate change.\\nShelter\\nThe shelter-related work of the \\n\\nIFRC Network is a continuous \\n\\nprocess that extends from \\n\\npreparedness, through the period \\n\\nimmediately after disasters, \\n\\nto longer-term recovery and \\n\\ndevelopment. It addresses \\n\\nbroad and longer-term shelter \\n\\nand settlement issues such as \\n\\nshelter-related risks-reduction, \\n\\nhousing, land and property rights, \\n\\nsustainability, local building \\n\\npractices, and the urban context. \\n\\nAs well as supporting National \\n\\nSocieties to strengthen capacity \\n\\nand deliver their activities, the \\n\\nIFRC represents the Network \\n\\nthrough its leadership of the IASC \\n\\nShelter Cluster and promotes \\n\\nresearch to build knowledge \\n\\nand share best practices to \\n\\nensure safe, sustainable and \\n\\nappropriate shelter solutions.\\nAREAS OF FOCUS\\nAbout the IFRC\\nLivelihoods and  \\nBasic NeedsThe IFRC Network supports \\ncommunities affected by crises \\n\\nand disasters to restore and \\n\\nstrengthen the livelihoods of \\n\\nsurvivors and to develop their \\n\\nassets. It enables communities \\n\\nto enhance their capabilities, \\n\\nand to develop new skills that \\n\\ndiversify income and increase \\n\\n\\n\\ndoes this by promoting resilience \\n\\nand partnering and through its \\n\\nsupport to National Societies. \\n\\nIt provides them with tools and \\n\\ntraining and builds evidence \\n\\nof good practice through the \\n\\ncollection and analysis of data.\\nHealth\\n\\n\\n\\napproach to addressing the health \\n\\nneeds, risks and inequalities faced by \\n\\nthe most vulnerable communities. \\n\\nThe IFRC supports National Societies \\n\\nto be present, relevant and trusted \\n\\nhealth partners for communities. It \\n\\nis supporting National Societies by \\n\\nimproving the Community Based \\n\\nHealth and First Aid platform, \\n\\nexpanding health emergency surge \\n\\ncapacity and helping them to support \\n\\nhard-to-reach populations. The IFRC is \\n\\nalso introducing a Quality Assurance \\n\\nFramework aimed at improving \\n\\nstandards of emergency care and is \\n\\npromoting healthy and active ageing.\\nWater, Sanitation and \\nHygiene (WASH)\\nThe IFRC is facilitating the exchange \\n\\n\\nSocieties that are implementing \\n\\n\\n\\nto adapt technical and programme \\n\\nsupport for public health crises, \\n\\nepidemics and complex emergencies. \\n\\nIt helps them adapt and implement \\n\\nthe global IFRC WASH strategy, and \\n\\nto build capacity and consolidate \\n\\nemergency preparedness. The IFRC is \\n\\nalso launching an urban WASH Red \\n\\nCross and Red Crescent consortium \\n\\nfor the whole network and rolling out \\n\\n\\nAREAS OF FOCUS\\nAbout the IFRC\\nProtection, Gender \\nand Inclusion\\nThe IFRC supports National Societies \\nto build inclusive communities \\n\\nand a culture of non-violence and \\n\\npeace across all other Areas of Focus \\n\\nto ensure assistance to the most \\n\\nvulnerable people. The IFRC also \\n\\nsupports members to, through words \\n\\nand actions, to break down barriers \\n\\nof exclusion and marginalization. \\n\\nThe IFRC attempts to ensure that \\n\\n\\n\\nencourages National Societies to \\n\\ntake full account of and engage \\n\\nwith gender considerations, as well \\n\\n\\n\\ngroups such as youths, those \\n\\nwith disabilities and migrants.\\nMigration\\nThe IFRC helps National Societies \\n\\nsupport migrants and host \\n\\ncommunities, with humanitarian \\n\\nassistance, protection, advocacy and \\n\\nawareness raising. It coordinates all \\n\\nmatters related to migration within \\n\\nthe Network through the Migration \\n\\nTask Force. It has created the Migration \\n\\nFund which has made it possible \\n\\n\\n\\nof origin and transit. The IFRC also \\n\\nrepresents the network in global fora \\n\\nsuch as the Global Compact on safe, \\n\\norderly and regular migration, and \\n\\nthe Global Refugee Compact. It also \\n\\ndevelops tools to enable National \\n\\nSocieties to engage more effectively \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith access to life-saving information, \\n\\n\\n\\nof resilience-building practices \\n\\ndeveloped by National Societies.\\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \\n Annual Report 2018\\nThe Movement Structure\\nWhat is the International \\nRed Cross and Red \\nCrescent Movement?\\nThe Movement is made up of all National Societies, \\nthe International Federation of Red Cross and Red \\nCrescent Societies (IFRC), and the International \\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The Movement \\nis neutral and impartial and provides protection \\nand assistance to people affected by disasters and \\ncon˚icts.\\nThe strength of the Movement is its network. National \\nSocieties are present before crises and remain long \\nafter, and their volunteers come from the very com\\n-munities they support. Together, the components of \\nthe Movement support one another to deliver vital \\nservices for local to global impact. The Movement \\nworks with governments, donors and other human\\n-itarian and aid organizations to assist vulnerable \\npeople around the world.\\nTHE INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS \\nAND RED CRESCENT MOVEMENT\\nWhat are National Societies?\\nThere are 190 National Red Cross and Red Crescent \\nSocieties with 160,000 local branches and 13.7 million \\nvolunteers. Each National Society is an independent, \\nimpartial and neutral organization, that carries \\nout humanitarian and development activities and \\nprogrammes. Rooted in local communities, and as \\nauxiliaries to the public authorities in the humani\\n-tarian ˜eld, they have a status and access that most \\nother organizations do not.\\nThe International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement\\nDuring situations of \\n\\n\\ncoordinates the \\n\\nMovement\\'s \\n\\ninternational relief \\n\\nactivities. \\n\\n\\n\\ninternational \\n\\nhumanitarian law and \\n\\nuniversal humanitarian \\n\\n\\nRed Cross and Red Crescent National Societies\\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\\n\\n190Voluntary \\nService\\nUniversality\\nUnity \\nHumanity \\nNeutrality\\nImpartiality\\n\\nProtecting \\nthe lives \\n\\nand dignity \\n\\nof victims \\n\\nof war and \\n\\ninternal \\n\\nviolence.\\nBased in communities \\nand supported \\nby 13.7 million \\nvolunteers\\n\\n\\n\\nforms of humanitarian activities \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncontributing to the maintenance \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresence in \\n5 regional \\n\\n50 country \\n\\nWhat is the IFRC?\\nNational Societies come together to form the IFRCŠ\\nthe world™s largest humanitarian network. The IFRC is \\na membership organization established by and com\\n-prised of National Societies.\\nThe IFRC works to inspire, encourage, facilitate and \\npromote at all times all forms of humanitarian activ\\n-ities by National Societies, with a view to preventing \\nand alleviating human suffering, and thereby con\\n-tributing to the upholding and promotion of human \\ndignity and peace in the world.\\nThe IFRC, headquartered in Geneva, has ˜ve regional \\nof˜ces and more than 50 country of˜ces around the \\nworld that coordinate and provide support to individ\\n-ual or to clusters of National Societies towards their \\nemergency and development work. IFRC ensures \\ncoordination within the network during international \\nemergencies, promotes cooperation and represents \\nNational Societies in the international ˜eld.\\nThe IFRC supports National Societies to strengthen \\ntheir capacities to respond to crises and to provide \\neffective services to the most vulnerable.\\nIn 2015 the IFRC General Assembly adopted the Plan \\nand Budget 2016Œ2020 which drives the IFRC pro\\n-gramme priorities.\\nThe decisions on IFRC direction and policy are made \\nby its governing bodies. These bodies de˜ne a frame\\n-work of purpose, policies, goals and programmes, \\nand provide a mechanism for accountability and \\ncompliance. The General Assembly is the highest \\ndecision-making body of the IFRC. It meets every two \\nyears and comprises representatives from all member \\nNational Societies.\\nThe Governing Board acts between general assem\\n-blies with the authority to make certain decisions. \\nThe Board comprises the IFRC™s President and Vice \\nPresidents, representatives from elected member \\nSocieties, the Chair of the Finance Commission and \\nthe Chair of the Youth Commission. The IFRC has \\nfour constitutional commissions/committees: Finance \\nCommission, Youth Commission, Compliance and \\nMediation Committee and Election Committee.\\nWhat is the role of the ICRC?\\nThe \\nICRC\\n is an impartial, neutral and independent \\norganization with the exclusive humanitarian mis\\n-sion to protect the lives and dignity of victims of \\nwar and internal violence and to provide them with \\nassistance. During situations of con˚ict, the ICRC \\nis responsible for directing and coordinating the \\nMovement™s international relief activities. It also pro\\n-motes the importance of international humanitarian \\nlaw and draws attention to universal humanitarian \\nprinciples.\\nLocalization\\nOn the occasion of the World Humanitarian Summit In 2016, major donors \\nand humanitarian agencies adopted the ﬁGrand Bargainﬂ, which included \\ncommitments to channel more international humanitarian funds directly to \\nlocal actors, increase investment in their long-term sustainability, improve \\nthe quality of partnerships between international and local actors and \\nstrengthen the integration of local and international coordination.\\nTogether with the Government of Switzerland, the IFRC has served as \\nco-convener of the Grand Bargain™s Localization Workstream, through which \\nGrand Bargain signatories and invited local actors have worked together to \\nshare good practice and overcome obstacles to achieving the commitments, \\nincluding by organizing joint exploratory missions to countries affected \\nby crises.\\nIn its independent evaluation of progress on the Grand Bargain in 2018, ODI \\nreported that the proportion of international humanitarian funds channelled \\nﬁas directly as possibleﬂ to local actors increased from 2.9 per cent in 2017 to \\n8.74 per cent in 2018 and that there is ﬁa growing normative shift towards \\nmore support and more funding for local and national responders.ﬂ It also \\npointed to progress in the integration of local actors in international coordi\\n-nation mechanisms. National NGOs and National Societies now represent 42 \\nper cent of humanitarian cluster members globally and there is an increas\\n-ingly positive approach towards partnership among some agencies. However, \\nthere is still a signi˜cant amount of progress required to achieve the Grand \\nBargain™s ambitious goals, especially for 25 per cent of humanitarian funding \\nto be channelled as directly as possible to local actors.\\nSupport for local action has been central to the IFRC™s mission since its begin\\n-ning, so it is unsurprising that in 2018, it is one of only a few organizations \\nthat are able to exceed the Grand Bargain™s 25 per cent ˜nancing goal and that \\nmore than 70 per cent of its partnership agreements with National Societies \\nincluded support for strengthening capacity.\\nNational NGOs and National Societies now represent \\n42% of humanitarian cluster members globally \\nand there is an increasingly positive approach \\ntowards partnership among some agencies.\\nSPOTLIGHT ON:\\n LOCALIZATION\\nSTRENGTHEN LOCALIZATION \\nEFFORTS IN EMERGENCIES\\nCollaborating\\n with the ICRC to \\ndevelop the National \\nSociety Investment \\nAlliance (NSIA) to \\nprovide multi-year \\n\\nand support to \\nNational Societies to \\nstrengthen their long-\\nterm ability to deliver \\nrelevant and effective \\nhumanitarian services.\\nDrafting\\n of a new National \\nSociety Development \\nCompact (slated for \\nadoption in the 2019 \\nIFRC General Assembly) \\ndesigned to harmonize \\ndevelopment support \\nwithin the IFRC \\nnetwork and ensure \\nthat it is aimed at \\nlocally-developed goals.\\nCompletion\\n of more than \\n250 Branch-level \\nOrganizational Capacity \\nAssessments (BOCA) \\nby local branches of \\nNational Societies to \\nassess strengths and \\nweaknesses, bringing \\nthe accumulated \\n\\ntotal to over 1,000.\\nStock taking\\n exercise with both \\nUNICEF and WFP \\non recent pilot \\ninitiatives for capacity \\nstrengthening of \\nNational Societies in line with their \\ncommitment to the \\nGrand Bargain.\\nAllocation by the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) CHF 23.57 \\nmillion to 61 National Societies to provide support to 5.14 million people. \\nThe DREF also launched its new Forecast Based Action Window, with \\nan expected turnover of CHF2.5 million in 2019 for early action.\\nLaunch of 14 Emergency Appeals in support of National Society \\nresponse operations, for a total funding requirement of CHF 128.6 \\nmillion (CHF 76.5 million received) to support 16.9 million people.\\nBoth the IFRC and its members continue to actively strengthen their localization \\nefforts. In 2018, this included:\\nCHF 23.8\\n million61NationalSocieties5.14\\nmillionpeople14Emergency\\nAppeals\\nCHF 76.5\\n million16.9\\nmillionpeopleHow We Are Funded\\nHOW WE ARE FUNDED\\nCarrying out the IFRC™s work to support vulnerable communities is largely dependent on ˜nan\\n-cial support from partners. The IFRC seeks to secure income that is as predictable and as ˚exible \\nas possible to ensure that it can best serve its network of National Societies and vulnerable com\\n-munities. It seeks to strengthen existing partnerships and engage with new partners.\\nThe IFRC receives funds through:\\n1Statutory Contributions\\nEach National Society provides an annual contribution to the IFRC determined by a formula \\napproved by the General Assembly. The contribution of each National Society varies, \\ndepending on its income and the UN quota for that country. In 2018, a total of CHF 35 million \\nwere contributed in Statutory Contributions by 136 National Societies.\\n2Voluntary Contributions and Donations\\nVoluntary Contributions and Donations represent the largest source of income to the IFRC, \\nalthough the amount varies annually. In 2018, CHF 260 million was received from 168 \\ndonors, of which 50 are National Societies and 118 others, including 30 governments, 5 \\nmultilateral agencies and 36 corporations. Of this CHF 29 million was unrestricted, which \\nallows the IFRC the greatest ˚exibility to pursue its objectives. The remaining CHF 231 \\nmillion went to ˜nance Thematic programmes and Humanitarian Response operations.\\n3Supplementary Service Fees\\nThe IFRC provides services to some National Societies and other partners, such as \\nprocurement and logistics support, the provision of ˚eet vehicles and rental of shared \\nof˜ce space. Income from Supplementary Service Fees was CHF 30 million in 2018.\\n4Cost Recoveries:\\nSome donors have speci˜c reporting requirements that incur additional administrative \\nexpenses. The IFRC recovers those costs in three ways:\\nŁ Indirect expenses, such \\nas administrative and \\nother costs are recovered \\nat a rate of 6.5 per cent. \\nThis programme and \\nservice support recovery \\nrate is lower than the \\naverage 7 per cent for \\nUnited Nations and other international development agencies \\nand is frequently capped \\nto actual costs to ensure \\nno pro˜t is made.\\nŁ The rates of cost recovery \\nfor the provision of \\n˚eet vehicles and other \\nlogistics services are \\nreviewed annually \\nand apply equally to \\nhumanitarian response \\noperations, thematic \\nprogrammes and \\nSupplementary Service agreements.\\nŁ Non-standard \\ndonor-speci˜c reporting \\nis subject to a fee of 1 per cent of that donor™s \\ncontribution to cover \\nadditional administrative \\noverheads and range \\nfrom CHF 200 to CHF 500 \\nper report.\\nIn 2018, 56 per cent of the IFRC™s funding was tightly earmarked, 19 per cent was earmarked \\nand 7 per cent was softly earmarked.\\nWhy is Flexible \\nFunding so \\nVital?\\nThe environment in which \\nthe IFRC works can be volatile, \\nwith rapidly changing needs \\nand conditions. National \\nSocieties and the IFRC \\ntherefore need to be agile.\\nFlexible funding, \\nreferred to in the IFRC \\nas regular resources, is \\ncrucial to this agility. \\nRegular resources are funds \\nthat are contributed to the \\nIFRC without restrictions on \\ntheir use. These types of funds \\nallow the IFRC to deliver critical \\nhumanitarian support where \\nand when it is needed most, \\nincluding in situations that \\nreceive less media attention \\nand funding coverage like \\nprotracted or smaller sized \\ncrises. They include voluntary \\ncontributions from partners, and \\nstatutory contributions from \\nmember National Societies. \\nRegular Resources \\nare an investment \\nin the ability of the \\norganization to respond \\nto the needs of the \\nmost vulnerable. \\nWithout them, the IFRC would \\nnot be able to deliver on its \\nmandate to support the most \\nvulnerable people. They re˚ect \\nthe trust and con˜dence of \\npartners in the IFRC to deliver \\non its mandate and to report on \\nhow those funds have been used.\\nRegular resources allow \\nthe IFRC to ensure a \\npresence around the \\nworld which enables \\nrapid respond to crises. \\nAs well as ˜lling gaps that \\nother sources of funding may \\nleave, regular resources also \\nserve as a catalyst. They help \\nto spur innovation, which \\nhelps transform and improve \\nthe way IFRC works.\\nRegular resources have a \\nmultiplier effect. Strengthening \\nthe IFRC allows it to better \\nsupport National Societies. Strong \\nlocal actors are a necessity \\nfor delivering relevant and \\neffective assistance. Regular \\nresources enable the IFRC to \\nprovide National Societies with \\nsupport, for example in the \\nform of emergency funds, but \\nmainly to develop their capacity \\nthrough the provision of training \\nand technical expertise that \\nis vital to their success. This \\nsupport has a direct impact on \\nthe ability of National Societies \\nto deliver life-saving assistance \\nin their local communities. \\nThe IFRC also uses regular \\nresources to help National \\nSocieties ensure their \\norganizational building blocks, \\nsuch as statutes and governance \\nstructures, ˜nancial management, \\nresource mobilization, and \\nvolunteers, are in place and \\nthat they are effective. It uses \\nregular resources to provide \\nthem with training in e.g. disaster \\nand epidemic preparedness, \\nlogistics and surge support, \\ncommunity resilience, shelter \\nawareness, as well as engagement \\nwith and accountability \\nto local communities.\\nRegular resources \\nprovide critical \\nsupport for the IFRC™s \\ncore functions. \\nRegular resources enable the \\nIFRC to have a ˜eld presence \\nwhich means it can provide \\nurgently needed ˜eld support \\nquickly and effectively \\nin critical humanitarian \\ncontexts. They enable the \\nIFRC to provide the effective \\nreporting and accountability \\nrequired by its donors, and to \\nconduct the monitoring and \\nevaluations needed to track \\norganizational impact and \\nstrengthen its activities. \\nDetailed information on \\nhow the IFRC used regular \\nresources and their impact \\nin 2018 will be found in the \\nregular resources section.\\nPartnership\\nWorking in Partnership\\nPartnerships are essential for the delivery of effective support \\nto vulnerable communities. IFRC works with partners to mobi\\n-lize resources, to develop joint initiatives and to ensure greater \\n\\ncoordination and˛complementarity across the humanitarian and \\n\\ndevelopment sectors.˛Engagement with partners supports both the \\n\\nwork of the IFRC and facilitates opportunities for National Societies \\n\\nin support of their own work and to strengthen the network.\\nPartnering with the IFRC provides the opportunity to engage with \\na global network with experience in some of the most challeng\\n-ing contexts in the world. The IFRC works closely with partners to \\n\\nensure alignment between the needs and objectives of the IFRC \\n\\nNetwork and those of partners. The IFRC privileges long-term \\n\\nstrategic and sustainable partnerships that are aligned with our \\n\\nprinciples and thematic areas of focus. The IFRC seeks partnerships \\n\\nthat have the potential to have a positive impact on the lives, resil\\n-ience and dignity of vulnerable communities.\\nThe IFRC is grateful to˛our partners for providing crucial assistance \\ntowards increasing the resilience of the world™s most vulnerable \\n\\ncommunities.\\nPARTNERSHIP\\nNational Societies\\nThe IFRC engages in variety \\nof partnerships with member \\nNational Societies. Support is pro\\n-vided through National Society \\nStatutory contributions, which \\nis part of the regular resources \\nbudget of the IFRC. Financial \\ncontributions that support the \\nIFRC™s plan and budget and \\nemergency appeals may also be \\nprovided. The secondment of \\nstaff by National Societies to the \\nIFRC or to support international \\noperations is also highly valuable.\\nGovernments\\nThe IFRC engages with govern\\n-ments in strategic dialogue and \\npartnership to exchange exper\\n-tise and secure support for the \\nwork of the IFRC and National \\nSocieties. This is always done in \\npartnership with the National \\nSociety in that country. National \\nSocieties and the IFRC ensure \\nthat governments are well \\ninformed on how the network is \\nresponding to challenges around \\nthe world and how governments \\ncan collaborate in responding.\\nMultilateral and international \\n\\nThe IFRC engages with these \\norganizations to ensure effec\\n-tive coordination, to secure \\nsupport for its work and to \\nprovide National Societies with \\naccess to funds. By engaging \\ntogether, National Societies can \\nbene˜t from the IFRC™s status \\nas an international organiza\\n-tion. The IFRC is able to access \\nfunds that National Societies are \\nsometimes not eligible for. The \\nIFRC can also provide support \\nto National Societies to access \\nfunds from institutions where \\nprocesses can be highly complex.\\nPrivate sector\\nThe IFRC™s engagement with the \\nprivate sector has become more \\nsophisticated as the nature of pri\\n-vate sector interest in supporting \\nhumanitarian and development \\nwork has evolved. While the \\nIFRC continues to receive mon\\n-etary or in-kind support from \\nsome private sector partners, \\nothers are providing knowledge \\nor technology-based support, \\nengaging in advocacy campaigns \\nor developing joint projects. The \\nIFRC leverages global relation\\n-ships that can bene˜t National \\nSocieties who can engage with \\ncompanies at the local level.\\nDonor Advisory Group\\nThe IFRC has convened a Donor \\nAdvisory Group which is com\\n-posed of representatives of \\ndonor governments, member \\nNational Societies of those same \\ncountries, and the European \\nUnion. Group members are \\norganizations that contribute \\nmultilaterally to the IFRC more \\nthan CHF 10 million annually \\nfor at least two consecutive \\nyears. There are currently eight \\nmembers and three observers.\\nThe goal of the group is to:\\nŁ Provide a forum for high-level \\nstrategic and policy dialogue \\non global issues that include both humanitarian and development assistance, and \\ndonor trends.\\nŁ Contribute to strengthening \\nour partnerships, for the \\nbene˜t of all members of the Donor Advisory Group, and \\nultimately for the bene˜t of \\nall member National Societies of the IFRC.\\nŁ Provide high-level strategic \\ninputs to the IFRC as to how \\nit can strengthen partnership \\nopportunities.\\nIn 2018, members of the DAG \\naccompanied the IFRC on a ˜eld \\nvisit to Bangladesh to the opera\\n-tion in Cox™s Bazar, meeting with \\nthe Bangladesh Red Crescent, \\ngovernment of˜cials and other \\nagencies working on the ground. \\nThese visits encourage a better \\nunderstanding of the work of \\nthe Red Cross and Red Crescent \\nin challenging contexts.\\nPartnership\\n\\n\\n\\n (includes regular resources and funds for emergencies and thematic programming (CHFm)\\nEuropean Commission\\n36.0\\nUSA28.0\\nUK26.7\\nSweden\\n23.5Netherlands\\n15.1\\nJapan\\n7.5\\nNorway\\n15.0\\nCanada\\n4.9\\n\\n156.7\\nTypes of engagement with partners\\nMonetary\\nPartners work with the IFRC to support National Societies. This may be by providing funding for an emergency \\nappeal, non-emergency speci˜c thematic programming, or support for programming in a speci˜c country or \\nregion. More importantly, partners also provide unearmarked funding that the IFRC directs where it is most \\nneeded, including to protracted crises and silent emergencies that attract no media coverage.\\nProgramming\\nThe IFRC engages with partners in the humanitarian and development sectors in creation and implementation \\nof programming. Different partners have different specializations and skills and the IFRC works with partners \\ndirectly in programming whenever possible and appropriate to ensure coordinated and ef˜cient programming.\\nNon-monetary\\nŁ In-kind: partners may support the IFRC through the provision of either goods or services. Goods would \\ninclude items needed to carry out programming that would otherwise need to be purchased.\\nŁ Learning: IFRC also engages partners to develop and share learning and best practices. For example, the \\nIFRC may engage with technology partners in mapping exercises that provide better analysis and therefore \\nimprove programming. We are implementing an international digital literacy programme to support our \\nNational Societies to improve their governance and management. Thanks to the pro-bono consultancy \\nreceived by companies™ leaders in IT and digital strategy, we have developed new digital platforms to better \\nmonitor and evaluate our operations in the ˜eld.\\nŁ Advocacy and diplomacy: The IFRC engages with partners to promote humanitarian values and priorities, \\nto in˚uence global discussions and policies.\\nEvery partnership is extremely important both to the IFRC and to vulnerable communities. The following pro\\n-vides only a few examples of the many partnerships that the IFRC engages in globally.\\nZurich Flood Resilience Alliance\\nThe IFRC partnered with the Zurich Insurance Group, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSystems and Analysis, the London School of Economics, \\n\\nand the Institute for Social and Environmental Transition-\\n\\nInternational in the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance\\n. \\n\\n\\nto help communities in developed and developing \\n\\n\\nIslamic Development \\n\\nIn April 2018 IFRC signed a global \\nMemorandum of Understanding \\n\\nwith the˛Islamic Development \\n\\nBank (IsDB).

As a membership organization, this is the \\nprimary goal of the IFRC and drives its use of unear\\n-marked funding. It also provides ˚exibility to put money \\nwhere it is needed for more effective programming. For \\nthe IFRC, it ensures the necessary investment to sup\\n-port achievements in Areas of Focus and Strategies \\nfor Implementation. As such it includes, leadership \\nmanagement, internal control and support functions, \\nas well as direct investment in strengthening the \\nREGULAR RESOURCES\\ncapacities of National Societies and investment in crit\\n-ical countries of operation. In the IFRC, unearmarked \\nfunding is referred to as regular resources.\\nThere is often a mix of unearmarked funding ensuring \\nessential functions, sustainability and targeted invest\\n-ment; completed by earmarked resources that are \\nraised for speci˜c areas of work or projects. Therefore, \\nregular resources make a valuable contribution to all \\nour work. They help to ensure stability, continuity and \\ninnovation that would not be possible without them.\\n(unearmarked funding)\\nRegular Resources\\nPriorities\\nAs a membership organization, IFRC makes use of regular resources to ensure that National Societies are strong, \\ncapable and accountable organizations that can deliver effective services to the most vulnerable communities \\nand individuals. As such, priorities for the use of regular resources include:\\nŁ investment in ˜eld presence and infrastructure, including for country and cluster of˜ces, who provide \\ndirect support to National Societies and have a capacity strengthening role for the country (cluster) \\nthey support.\\nŁ compliance, Internal Control and support functions both at HQ and Regional level: such as Legal; Of˜ce \\nof Internal Audit and Investigations; Finance; IT; Human Resources; Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation and \\nReporting; Partnerships and Resource Development; and Security. These are all essential functions to \\nensure accountability both to our partners and the communities we serve.\\nŁ direct investment in National Society capacity strengthening including a strong focus on organizational \\ndevelopment\\nŁ effective programme and operational delivery support to National Societies while ensuring accountability\\nŁ seed money in each Area of Focus and Strategy for Implementation, serving as a catalyst to leverage \\nadditional funding.\\nŁ leadership and Governance\\nŁ policy setting, leadership and capacity in Strategies for Implementations at HQ and Regional Level.\\nIncome\\nFor the past three years, the IFRC has made signi˜cant progress in growing unearmarked funding for its work \\nin support of National Societies. In 2018, the IFRC received CHF 93.2 million in regular resources out of a target \\nof CHF 105 million. This was an increase of CHF 4 million from 2017, thanks to donations from partners. This \\nincrease allowed the IFRC to invest an additional CHF 2 million in its regional and country/cluster of˜ces.\\nRegular resources consist of statutory contributions from member National Societies, contributions from part\\n-ners, cost recoveries and other income.\\n\\nCHF million2018\\nStatutory contributions\\n34.1\\nVoluntary contributions (from National Societies)\\n0.2\\nDonations (from other donors)\\n27.6\\nCost recoveries\\n26.3\\nOther income\\n5.0\\n\\n93.2\\nThe total amount of regular resources received in 2018, including statutory contributions, accounted for approx\\n-imately 20 per cent of the total IFRC budget.

These country of˜ces \\nprovide direct, real-time support to National Societies \\nduring emergencies such as the ongoing Ebola epidemic.\\n\\n In 2018 regular resources supported the shelter team™s \\nPASSA initiative (Participatory Approach for Safe \\nShelter and Settlements Awareness), which is a par\\n-ticipatory method of disaster risk reduction related to \\nshelter and settlements safety. This project received \\nthe inaugural Facebook community award. Regular \\nresources also allowed the IFRC to provide direct sup\\n-port to National Societies who want to develop their \\ncapacities in shelter programming.\\n\\n IFRC increased its commitment to becoming a leader \\nin the use of cash by ensuring that a role was embed\\n-ded in the IFRC to lead on the strategic vision and \\nimplementation of IFRC use of cash programming. \\nThis supports a consistent and integrated approach \\nto ensuring that National Societies are cash ready and \\nable to implement cash programming.\\n\\nAdditional investment in WASH, for example, allowed \\nthe IFRC to expand its work to ensure better inte\\n-gration between WASH and public health including \\nthrough hygiene promotion, nutrition and menstrual \\nhygiene management.\\nSFI 1: Strengthen National Societies\\nSupporting National Societies to develop their capac\\n-ities is one of the main mandates of the IFRC. This \\ndirectly contributes to the localization workstream of \\nthe Grand Bargain by ensuring strong and effective \\nlocal actors. Strong local actors are also essential to \\nensuring progress on Sustainable Development Goals. \\nHowever, this work can be dif˜cult to fund, which \\nmakes the availability of unearmarked funding crucial. \\nIn 2018, regular resources enabled the IFRC to invest in:\\nŁ Organizational Capacity Assessment and \\nCerti˜cation (OCAC): the process was facilitated \\nfor several National Societies who would \\notherwise not have had the resources to do so. \\nRegular resources also supported the availability \\nof staff to execute the OCAC process. OCAC is an \\nessential tool that supports National Societies to \\nassess their development needs and make a clear \\nplan to achieve progress.\\nŁ The development of the National Society \\nDevelopment Compact, which will ensure a \\ncoordinated and systematic approach to National \\nSociety development; co-leading with UNFPA of the \\nCompact for Young People in Humanitarian Action.\\nŁ The funding of country of˜ces mentioned above \\nalso support National Society development as \\nthese of˜ces are on the front line of providing \\nsupport to National Societies.\\nŁ Regional coordinators for National Society capacity \\ndevelopment in Asia Paci˜c, Europe and Middle \\nEast North Africa. However, due to lack of funding \\nthere are no regional coordination roles in Africa \\nand the Americas. These roles are essential to \\nproviding support to both country/cluster of˜ces \\nand National Societies. They play an important \\nrole in ensuring the link between global strategies \\nand National Society needs on the ground.\\nIt is important to note, that IFRC™s support to National \\nSocieties in their development is not limited to \\nStrategy for Implementation 1. While Strategy for \\nimplementation 1 focuses mainly on organizational \\ndevelopment, the IFRC provides supports National \\nSociety development across all its areas of focus. Work \\nto ensure that National Societies are ‚cash ready™, and \\nable to effectively implement cash programming, is one \\nexample of how IFRC is supporting National Society \\ndevelopment through its thematic areas of work.\\nIFRC used regular resources as a catalyst for its inno\\n-vation work. By contributing the manager of the \\nInnovation team, IFRC was able to leverage support \\nfrom several National Societies who have also contrib\\n-uted staff members (Global Innovative Finance Team \\nis co-funded). The team™s initial focus on research and \\nstrategy has quickly turned around to experimenting \\nwith and carrying out models. The innovative ˜nance \\nteam is built on a two-year model and the income \\nsecured by the team has already far surpassed the ini\\n-tial ˜nancial investment. The team was, for example, \\ninstrumental in developing a Sukuk Bond model with \\nthe Islamic Development Bank to support our water, \\nsanitation and hygiene work. The IFRC™s work with \\nblockchain technology also received a Global Islamic \\nFintech award.\\nSFI 2: Ensure effective international disaster \\nmanagement\\nŁ In 2018 the IFRC increased investment in supply \\nchain (logistics) with the addition of a unit in the \\nIFRC™s Global Service Centre in Budapest. Not only \\nwill this unit have positive cost bene˜ts for the \\nIFRC, but it will also enable increased logistics \\nsupport during operations.\\nŁ Coordination among the components of the \\nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent \\nMovement is also supported through unearmarked \\nfunding. The IFRC™s work in Strengthening \\nMovement Coordination and Cooperation (SMCC) \\nhas helped to ensure progress on the three SMCC \\nresolutions of the Council of Delegates, including \\nthe development of a plan of action. The goal \\nis to achieve ef˜ciency and effectiveness in \\noperations throughout the IFRC Membership and \\nthe Movement by 1) strengthening coordination \\nand integration of operational interventions, \\nplatforms and mechanisms; 2) overseeing effective \\nimplementation on the ground building on mutual \\nand multilateral complementarity; and 3) achieving \\neconomies of scale.\\nŁ The IFRC has also advanced a shared leadership \\nmodel with the support of regular resources. \\nPractical guidelines have been developed to \\nsupport components of the Movement in working \\ntogether more effectively. This includes guidelines \\nspeci˜cally developed and used for Movement \\ncomponents working in Bangladesh.\\nŁ The IFRC offers bene˜t, through its legal status, \\nto National Societies who provide in-country \\nbilateral support to their sister societies through \\nthe provision of integration services. This enables \\npartner National Societies to work in another \\ncountry by legally integrating with the IFRC and \\nthus supports greater coordination and support \\nacross the IFRC Network.\\nSFI 4: Ensure a strong IFRC that is effective, \\ncredible and accountable\\nThe IFRC has invested heavily in its internal audit and \\ninvestigation capacity, which is an independent function \\nthat oversees the effectiveness of the organization™s risk \\nmanagement and internal control systems. This invest\\n-ment has been directly supported by regular resources. \\nFor more detailed information on our internal audit and \\ninvestigations work please refer to Annex 1.\\nGovernance is another important function that the \\nIFRC carries out for its network and is supported by \\nregular resources. The IFRC coordinates and supports \\nthe meetings of the IFRC™s governing bodies such as the \\nGeneral Assembly (the IFRC™s highest governing body), \\nthe Governing Board (meets twice a year and has the \\nauthority to make certain decisions in between sessions \\nof the General Assembly) and the Council of Delegates \\n(which includes all National Societies, the IFRC and \\nthe ICRC). The Governance function at the IFRC also \\ncontributes to the organization of the International \\nConference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent which \\nbrings together all the components of the Movement as \\nwell as States Parties to the Geneva Conventions. These \\ngroups are essential for setting priorities and ensuring \\na coordinated effort toward shared humanitarian goals.\\nFinance and Administration is committed to ensure \\ngood stewardship of IFRC assets and resources, to pro\\n-vide high quality support services in the most ef˜cient \\nand cost-effective manner, and to support National \\nSocieties. In 2018, supported by regular resources, \\nFinance and Administration continued to lead an \\norganization-wide process to improve the way IFRC \\nworks with its project partners through enhanced \\n˜nancial modalities and risk mitigation measures. The \\nFinance and Administration is also engaged in the \\nstrengthening of National Society capacities, particu\\n-larly as it relates to:\\nŁ enhancing ˜nancial and accountability systemsŁ development of policies, standards and tools\\nŁ provision of technical assistance\\nŁ facilitating sharing of knowledge and \\nexpertise, and\\nŁ fostering partnerships with administration \\ngroups, ˜nancial institutions, ˜nancial and \\nprofessional services networks and ˜rms.\\nRegular Resources\\nConstruction of the new IFRC \\nBuilding Project\\n was \\n˜nalized in 2018. This project, which started in late \\n2010, addressed recurrent and long-standing prob\\n-lems such as land issues and increasing obsolescence \\nof the IFRC™s annex buildings. A series of consulta\\n-tions together with the Swiss/Geneva local authorities \\nduring 2012 and 2013 addressed the two main issues \\nof the land legal base and the funding options in our \\ncapacity as an international organization based in \\nSwitzerland. The building project focused on how \\nthe of˜ce environment can support individuals and \\ndepartments to work together as one seamless orga\\n-nization to create a new type of globally in˚uential \\ninstitution. The Swiss authorities have provided 59.4 \\nmillion to the project in an interest free loan.\\nIn its continuous drive to ensure that the IFRC is an \\nef˜cient and effective organization that is prepared \\nfor the future, an \\nEnterprise Resource Planning\\n exercise \\nbegan in 2017. ERP allows an organization to use a \\nsystem of integrated software of across an organiza\\n-tion. For the IFRC, this will integrate current systems \\nlike human resources, Finance, Logistics and part\\n-nerships as well as give IFRC new functionality for \\nplanning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting. The \\nimplementation of an ERP system will facilitate better \\nplanning, implementation of programming, reporting \\nand accountability. In 2018 regular resources contrib\\n-uted to this project as an assessment was carried out \\nto determine organizational requirements and de˜ne \\n\\nthe scope of the project. Following a request for pro\\n-posals process, Microsoft Dynamics 365 was chosen. \\nAt the same time, Microsoft has created a Tech for \\nSocial Impact Unit, whose main purpose is to develop \\na vertical solution for the humanitarian sector, called \\nﬁnon-pro˜t Acceleratorﬂ, within the Dynamics 365 \\nenvironment. IFRC will have the opportunity to input \\ninto this process. The above initiative was of˜cially \\nannounced at the NetHope Summit in November 2018. \\n\\nFollowing the selection of the ERP product, an request \\nfor proposals was held for an implementation partner \\nwhich will be selected in 2019.\\nAs the examples above illustrate, ˚exible funding is \\nvital for the IFRC to be able to carry out its role in \\nsupport of its network of National Societies and in \\n\\nservice of the world™s most vulnerable communities. \\nIFRC is grateful to its partners for their generous \\nunearmarked donations in 2018.\\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \\n Annual Report 2018\\nNational Society Investment \\nAlliance (NSIA)\\nIn 2018, the IFRC and the ICRC jointly launched the NSIA pooled \\nfund for long-term (maximum ˜ve years) and short-term (maxi\\n-mum one year) activities in medium, high and very high-risk \\ncountries.\\nThe fund provides ˚exible multi-year funding for National Societies \\nto scale-up in times of emergency and to deliver essential services \\nto vulnerable people.

They range from 12-month Bridge Grants of up to CHF 50,000 \\nto a maximum of 1 million Swiss franc Accelerator funding over a \\n˜ve-year period.\\nAt the close of 2018, CHF 1.1 million had been received from \\nSwiss Humanitarian Aid, and CHF 600,000 from the United States \\nDepartment of State Bureau of Population Refugees and Migration \\nfor the management and administration of the fund.\\n2018 saw the fund ˜nalize the design of its systems and pro\\n-cesses and launch its ˜rst call for proposals for which it received \\n48 applications from National Societies in all regions. The NSIA \\nthen conducted an independent and objective process of consul\\n-tation and review and agreed funding to the National Societies of \\nArmenia, Colombia, Comoros, Lebanon, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, \\nUganda, Ukraine and Zambia.\\nThe IFRC envisages the NSIA as one option in a range of funding \\nsupport from across the Movement.\\nFUNDSFunds\\nDisaster Relief Emergency \\nFund (DREF)\\nDREF was established in 1985 by the IFRC to provide immediate \\n˜nancial assistance to National Societies so they can effectively \\ncarry out their role as ˜rst responders after a disaster. It is recog\\n-nized in the Grand Bargain localization workstream as providing \\nfunding ‚as direct as possible™ to local and national actors.\\nIt is able to provide rapid emergency funding within 24 hours \\nfor small or large-scale relief operations. Funding may be in \\nthe form start-up loans for immediate emergency response, as \\ngrants to provide funding to National Societies so that they can \\ncarry out relief operations, or for the preparation of response in \\nthe case of imminent crisis.\\nThe total amount allocated in 2018 is similar to the amount \\nallocated in 2017 and exceeds the ˜ve-year average of CHF 20.6 \\nmillion. The 2018 ˜gures are in line with the IFRC™s projections \\nand strategy to increase the average annual turnover from \\nCHF 20 to 30 million by 2021.

It has been established as a separate \\n˜nancial fund for an initial three-year period, after which the IFRC will determine whether the mechanism \\ncan be fully integrated in the DREF. By the end of the year additional contributions had been received from the \\nGovernments of The Netherlands, Canada, and the Ball Foundation. Additionally, other DREF donors con˜rmed \\ntheir agreement for the use a certain amount of their contributions to the DREF to be used for FbA by the DREF.\\nThe FbA by the DREF provides a predictable supply of funding for the implementation of Early Action Protocols \\n(EAPs) and helps to overcome budget constraints on project scale, ˚exibility and accessibility.\\nAlthough no fund allocations were made during 2018, systems were put in place to help the fund become \\noperational, such as the creation of advisory groups, the development of quality criteria to evaluate the EAPs, \\nthe development of templates, the recruitment of a fund coordinator, the signature of the procedures and the \\ndiversi˜cation of the donor base.

The core \\nof the IFRC™s approach to strengthening National Societies lies in accompanying \\nthem on their own journeys of institutional development and strengthening.\\nStrengthen Local \\nCapacity\\nOne of the IFRC™s main priorities in 2018 was \\nsupporting National Societies and their approx\\n-imately 12 million volunteers to strengthen \\nand become more relevant within their local \\ncommunities.\\nThese efforts are closely aligned with the IFRC \\nco-leadership of the Grand Bargain Workstream \\non localization, alongside the Government of \\nSwitzerland, and forms the basis of the ˜rst \\nof the IFRC™s Strategies for Implementation: \\nStrengthen National Society capacities and \\nensure sustained and relevant Red Cross and \\nRed Crescent presence in communities.˛\\nAs part of its co-leadership with UNFPA of the \\nCompact for Young People in Humanitarian \\nAction, the IFRC coordinated the work of 60 \\nmembers globally from across the humani\\n-tarian sector. It also took steps to mainstream \\nits Youth Policy and IFRC Youth Engagement \\nStrategy across the IFRC™s Plan and Budget with \\na view to future continuity and growth.\\nThe IFRC supports National Societies in this \\nimportant work by improving access to techni\\n-cal expertise and resources. It supports them \\nwith innovation and training, helping them \\nto evaluate and learn from their work, as well \\nas that of the wider network. It also supports \\nNational Societies to nurture effective and moti\\n-vated volunteers, giving particular priority to \\nengaging with young people.\\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \\n Annual Report 2018\\nStrengthening National Societies\\nWhat is Preparedness \\nfor Effective Response?\\nPER is a disaster preparedness framework developed by \\nthe IFRC in consultation and in collaboration with National \\nSocieties and partners. It supports National Societies to \\nconstruct a workplan that strengthens coordination of pre\\n-paredness activities and to deliver disaster response services \\nin timely, ef˜cient and effective manner. Through PER, National \\nSocieties systematically assess, measure and analyse the strengths \\nand gaps in their response systems. Consequently, this results in a \\nbetter ability to address the needs of communities and provide them \\nwith vital services in times of disasters and crises.\\nThe PER is not a new approach, as it draws on two decades of learning from \\nWell-Prepared National Societies, Disaster Response Capacity Enhancement \\ntools and National Disaster Preparedness and Response Mechanisms. It opera\\n-tionalises IFRC Principles and Rules of Red Cross and Red Crescent Humanitarian \\nAssistance, and Disaster Preparedness Policy; and it complements the IFRC National \\nSocieties™ Development Framework and the ICRC™s Safer Access Framework.\\nThe IFRC has been working with partners, IFRC of˜ces, and departments within the \\nIFRC to mainstream the PER to ensure a common National Society preparedness approach. \\nCollaboration on the PER with the Health; Surge; Cash; Logistics; Chemical, biological, radio\\n-logical and/or nuclear teams and others are ongoing. The IFRC Health team is using the PER \\nframework in their Community Pandemic Preparedness Programme to ensure that National Society \\nresponse systems are ready to respond to disease epidemics.\\nEmpowering local \\nactors to provide \\nassistance is at \\nthe core of  \\nthe PER.\\nHellenic Red Cross \\nSamaritans looking  \\nfor survivors in  \\nthe town of Mati \\nafter the devastating \\n\\nover 90 lives.\\nStrengthening National Societies\\nIn 2018, the IFRC organized the second annual PER technical working group meeting to encourage peer-to-peer \\nlearning among National Societies on implementation of the PER process, incorporate collective learning to the \\nwider PER process, and to introduce other stakeholders to the PER. Two complete training packages were developed:\\none\\n1PER facilitators™ training and\\ntwo\\n2PER induction course.\\nThe purpose of the PER facilitators™ training is for champions and facilitators to accompany and implement PER \\nprocesses alongside National Societies, whereas, the PER induction course helps sensitise and promote the PER \\napproach with different stakeholders from technical areas and working groups. So far, 75 PER facilitators were \\ntrained and 74 undertook the PER induction course.\\nCOMPONENTS OF PER\\nRC Auxillary Role, \\nMandate and Law\\nDRM Policy\\nDRM Strategy\\nDisaster Law \\nAwareness and \\n\\nManagement\\nQuality and \\nAccountability\\nPolicy, Strategy \\n\\nand Standards\\nHazard, Context \\n\\nand Risk Analysis, \\n\\nMonitoring and \\n\\nEarly Warning\\nScenario Planning\\nRisk Management\\nPreparedness, \\nPlans and Budgets\\nBusiness Continuity\\nEmergency \\nResponse \\nProcedures (SOPs)\\nResponse and \\nRecovery Planning\\nPre-Disaster \\nMeetings and \\n\\nAgreements\\nAnalysis and \\n\\nPlanning\\n\\n\\nIntervention\\nMapping of NS \\nCapacities\\nEarly Action \\nMechanisms\\nCash Transfer \\nProgramming (CTP)\\nEmergency Needs \\nAssessment\\n\\nSelection\\nEmergency \\nOperations Centre \\n\\n(EOC)\\nInformation \\nManagement (IM)\\nTesting and \\nLearning\\nActivation of \\nRegional and \\n\\nInternational \\n\\nSupport\\nOperational \\n\\nCapacity\\nCoordination with \\n\\nMovement\\nCoordination with \\nAuthorities\\nCoordination with \\nExternal Agencies \\n\\nand NGOs\\nCivil Military \\nRelationsCoordination with \\nLocal Community \\n\\nLevel Responders\\nCooperation with \\nPrivate Sector\\nCoordination\\nSafety and Security \\n\\nManagement\\nOperations \\nMonitoring, \\n\\nEvaluation, \\n\\nReporting and \\n\\nLearning\\nFinance and \\nAdministration \\n\\nPolicy and \\n\\nEmergency \\n\\nProcedures\\nInformation and \\nCommunication \\n\\nTechnology (ICT)\\nLogistics, \\nProcurement and \\n\\nSupply ChainStaff and Volunteer \\nManagement\\nCommunication in \\nEmergencies\\nResource \\nMobilizationOperations \\n\\nSupport\\nInvesting in Volunteers\\nThe success of the IFRC is founded upon the staff and the millions of local volunteers who work with 190 \\nNational Societies, 60 delegations and around 165,000 local Red Cross and Red Crescent chapters, branches \\nand units all over the world. Volunteers are sources of inspiration and innovation. They bring their unique per\\n-spective, knowledge, skills and connection to the humanitarian needs and socio-cultural context of their own \\ncommunities. And they have a real stake in ˜nding practical solutions to overcome challenges.\\nThe IFRC worked with Spanish Red Cross Society leadership to support volunteers through a Global Volunteering \\nAlliance that re˚ects on current trends and imagines the future potential of volunteering. It helps them to coor\\n-dinate and deliver assistance to those affected by disasters and crises in a sustained, appropriate, independent \\nand timely way. It also promotes the Fundamental Principles, fosters a harmonised approach to preparedness \\nacross National Societies and Movement Partners, and encourages evidence-based identi˜cation of challenges \\n\\nand strengths.\\nHow Local is the IFRC?\\nNational Societies are sometimes the only organizations able to continue operating \\nlocally in challenging contexts. They are well placed to make a positive and sustainable \\n\\n\\nThe IFRC supports National Societies to become stronger actors in local, national, regional \\nand global networks and to reinforce their programmes. It has the consolidated know-how \\n\\nto support change processes, organizational development, and to strengthen capacity. \\nThe IFRC works with National \\nSocieties to increase the quality of \\n\\ntheir preparedness and response to \\n\\ndisasters and crises. It also supports \\n\\nNational Societies to become powerful \\n\\nactors in strengthening civil society \\n\\nand to leverage the full potential of \\n\\ntheir volunteer networks to capture \\n\\nand respond to the needs of their \\n\\ncommunities during times of crisis \\n\\nby providing relevant services.\\nStrengthening National Societies is one of \\nthe core mandates of the IFRC. \\nStrengthening National Societies\\nHowever, analysis of recent trends has revealed some emerging chal\\n-lenges. People appear to be volunteering for shorter periods, they are \\nfacing increasing threats to their lives and well-being, and there are \\nindications that, at local and national levels, the cadre of volunteers \\nmay not be suf˜ciently diverse to truly represent the communi\\n-ties they are supporting. In 2018, technical experts from National \\nSocieties and the IFRC came together in Geneva to re˚ect on these \\ntrends and challenges and the implications for the future of vol\\n-unteering within the Movement. National Societies are learning \\nfrom each other and designing and testing new volunteering \\napproaches. Teams have been formed to motivate and increase \\nthe engagement of volunteers as well as improve their safety \\nand wellbeing.˛Given the IFRC™s unparalleled experience with \\nvolunteerism, and its approach to innovation, it is well posi\\n-tioned to lead a global transformation in re-framing and \\nre-imagining the role of volunteers and voluntary action and \\nhow change can be initiated through grassroots action.\\nSince the launch of the Global Volunteering Alliance˛by \\nthe IFRC in 2017, 65 National Societies have joined its \\ncoordinated efforts.\\nThe spirit of \\nvolunteerism \\nhas been at the \\nheart of the Red \\nCross and Red \\nCrescent ethos for \\n\\nThe Youth of Today and Tomorrow\\nMore than half of IFRC volunteers are under 30 years \\nof age. Children, adolescents, and young adults play an \\nimportant role in building community resilience.

By helping us to make use of the increasing ˚ood of data in emergencies, \\nthe DEEP helps the IFRC network make better choices over what it can do to \\nhelp those in most need. The DEEP was built through the joint efforts of IFRC, \\nthe UN, Private Sector and NGOs; one of its main features is the way it enables  \\nanalysts to collaborate across organisations, thereby potentially improving a \\ncommon situational understanding.\\nThe DEEP integrates severity rankings, information reliability scoring, analyt\\n-ical frameworks and humanitarian pro˜ling approaches. It does not however \\nreplace the essential analysis required by humans. The IFRC, through increas\\n-ing use of the platform to collect, organise, rank, retrieve, and query crucial \\nquantitative and qualitative information, aims to strengthen the evidence \\nunderpinning operational decision-making.\\n2017 & 2018 IFRC SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS USING DEEP\\nDEEP used in 2018\\nDEEP used in 2017\\nTrinidad and Tobago\\nVenezuela\\nGuyana\\nColombia\\nPeru\\nEcuador\\nBrazil\\nMauritania\\nMaliBurkina Faso\\nNigerChad\\nSudanCameroon\\nDemocratic \\nRepublic of Congo\\nAfghanistan\\nBangladesh\\nAmericas\\n\\nPopulation \\n\\nMovement\\nBangledesh\\n\\nPopulation \\n\\nMovement\\nSahel\\n\\nFood \\n\\nInsecurity\\nAfghanistan\\n\\nDrought\\nCameroon\\n\\nElections\\n\\nPreparedness\\nDR Congo\\n\\nEbola Virus \\n\\nDisease\\nSPOTLIGHT ON:\\n  \\nSECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS\\nEnsure Effective International Disaster Management\\nEnsure Effective International Disaster Management\\nGO Platform\\nThe IFRC™s GO platform was launched in September 2018 to connect information on the \\nneeds of disaster-affected people with the right response. The GO platform helps users \\nto understand how the IFRC Network is responding to emergencies and serving the most \\nvulnerable. GO shares alerts for emerging crises and ˜eld reports from National Societies \\npreparing for and responding to emergencies. It collates important information for large scale \\nIFRC-supported emergency operations, ensuring data is both accurate and accessible. GO \\naims to make disaster information useful to Red Cross/Red Crescent responders for better \\ndecision making.\\nThe GO platform automates previously manual processes for calculating appeal data and \\nmakes this data easily accessible. The platform replaces many of the functions of the Disaster \\nManagement Information System (DMIS), applying new open source technologies to improve \\nanalysis and the presentation of the data.\\nEach emergency is different so IFRC GO has been built to be ˚exible and adaptable. Emergency \\npages can show rumour tracking for a response to an epidemic outbreak, items distributed \\nfor a response to a tropical cyclone or litres of water distributed in response to the risk of \\ncholera. The platform shows who and what has been deployed for IFRC-supported emergen\\n-cies as well as, crucially, what is still needed in terms of funding and people.\\nIn 2019, IFRC GO will incorporate a Preparedness for Effective Response module. This will \\nallow data speci˜c to the needs of National Societies to be uploaded and presented.

The 2018 climate-smart DRR mapping focused on the \\ncommunity-based disaster risk reduction including community-based \\ndisaster preparedness, DRR activities following disasters, National Society \\n\\ndisaster preparedness, and on identifying how many projects are climate \\nsmart or climate aware.\\nIntegration of climate risks\\nThe results show the continuous growth of the DRR work over the years. \\nOutreach and investment have more than quadrupled since 2009. In \\n2018, the IFRC and National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies made \\na near-record investment of more than CHF 207 million in disaster risk \\nreduction activities that were implemented in 160 countries and reached \\n52 million vulnerable people.

The PASSA \\ntraining took place in September and was applied during the ˚ood operations.\\nShelter\\nPASSA and PASSA Youth\\nParticipatory Approach for Safe Shelter Awareness (PASSA) is a \\nparticipatory method of disaster risk reduction related to shelter and set\\n-tlements safety. It is a variation of Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation \\nTransformation (PHAST), which has been used in many National Societies™ \\nprogrammes since the late 1990s. PHAST in turn is based on a partici\\n-patory approach called SARAR which stands for Self-esteem, Associative \\nstrengths, Resourcefulness, Action-planning and Responsibility. The aim \\nof PASSA is to develop local capacity to reduce shelter related risk by \\nraising awareness and developing skills in joint analysis, learning and \\ndecision-making at community level.\\nPASSA Youth is a variation of PASSA that is more attractive and productive \\nfor young people between 13 and 17 years old as important agents of change. \\nBringing PASSA into the digital age has meant adapting different aspects of \\nthe tool to incorporate social networks and multimedia resources, and to \\nconsider the viability of using these technologies in vulnerable communities.\\nThe methodology has been enriched by expanding the range of tools for \\nmapping, diagnosing and ˜nding solutions, which can be useful and inspir\\n-ing for participants of all ages.

Presence on these plat\\n-forms and fora ensures a say in the development \\nof the policies, priorities and practices which guide \\nthe humanitarian sector™s work on health. It high\\n-lighted the importance of community-based and \\npeople-centred approaches at every opportunity and \\ncalled for the recognition of volunteers, the impor\\n-tance of their safety and wellbeing and their role in \\nmeeting the health needs of the most vulnerable and \\nmarginalised people.\\n\\n Key Actors\\n\\ndeveloping new guidelines on the integration of community health workers into health \\nsystems and health policy. As a member, the IFRC championed the role of volunteers \\nand community health workers to help strengthen health systems and human resource \\n\\nworkers and volunteers in implementing health policies and as critical links between \\nclinics and communities. The IFRC also promoted the need to ensure appropriate training, \\nguidance and support to deliver quality, sustainable health services to their communities \\nand began developing guidelines on care in communities to help National Societies better \\n\\nCommunity health\\nThe IFRC™s Community Based Health and First Aid \\napproach (CBHFA) is the foundation of many National \\nSocieties™ community health work. National Societies \\nwork with vulnerable and marginalised groups to \\nidentify and address community health challenges. \\nThe CBHFA approach supports community-based vol\\n-unteers to act as a link between the formal health \\nsystem and the communities they serve. It teaches \\nvolunteers how to use root-cause analysis to identify \\ninterrelated health and community problems and \\naddress root-causes using behaviour change princi\\n-ples and expanding health literacy. In 2018, the IFRC \\nsubstantially revised the CBHFA materials with the \\nhelp of global experts in community health, behaviour \\nchange, psychosocial support, protection, gender \\nand inclusion. These revised materials ensure that \\nNational Societies continue to have the tools, skills \\nand knowledge to support their communities.\\nThe First Aid Reference Centre, \\nhosted by French Red Cross, supports \\n\\nlearning and knowledge sharing for \\n\\n\\n\\nprovides National Societies with tools \\n\\nand training methods to prepare and \\n\\nequip a growing number of people \\n\\nto save lives when a disaster or an \\n\\nemergency occurs.\\nHealth\\nHealthy ageing\\nNational Societies and volunteers in all regions are \\nexpanding their work with health authorities and \\nother stakeholders on healthy ageing and the provi\\n-sion of basic care in the community services. In 2018, \\nthe IFRC therefore worked with National Societies to \\ndevelop healthy ageing manuals and tools to support \\nthe quality and reach of staff and volunteers™ work on \\nthis issue.\\nThe IFRC co-facilitated the Global Platform on \\nPopulation Ageing, hosted by WHO and the World \\nEconomic forum, in preparation for the UN Decade for \\nHealthy Ageing as part of its advocacy work to ensure \\nthat older people are able to live healthy and active \\nlives with dignity. The IFRC also represented the net\\n-work™s messages at the Global Meeting of the Core \\nGroup to Combat Ageism where States and partners \\ngathered to develop strategic plans on healthy ageing.\\nNon-communicable diseases\\nIt is estimated that that less than 2 per cent of human\\n-itarian health funding goes to non-communicable \\ndiseases, despite the burden of such diseases in emer\\n-gency settings. Almost three quarters of all deaths \\nresulting from non-communicable diseases (28 mil\\n-lion people) and the majority of premature deaths (82 \\nper cent) occur in low- and middle-income countries \\nwhere health systems are largely unprepared and \\nunder-resourced to respond to growing needs.\\nIn 2018, the IFRC supported National Societies to \\ndevelop their health programming to respond to the \\nmorbidity and mortality trends. At the UN High-level \\nMeeting on Non-communicable diseases, held at the \\nUN General Assembly in September 2018, the IFRC \\nadvocated for increased prioritisation of the pre\\n-vention of non-communicable diseases and greater \\ninvestment in care at the community level. It raised \\nthe voices of National Societies and attention for the \\nwork of their staff and volunteers on these issues to \\nthe international community.\\nMental health and \\npsychosocial support\\nMental health and psychosocial support has been \\nidenti˜ed by the Movement as a priority for action \\nsince 2017, particularly as a consequence of con\\n-˚ict, natural disaster or other emergencies. However, \\nrecently there has been renewed discussion on the \\nwork of the IFRC Network in non-emergency settings \\nwhere there remains limited investment and an inad\\n-equate provision of services. In 2018, in preparation for \\nthe 33rd International Conference in December 2019, \\nthe MOMENT project was established to draft IFRC \\npolicy on mental health and psychosocial support. \\nThe project™s intention is to focus global attention on \\nthe needs of affected people, advocate for investment \\nin mental health and psychosocial support, and to \\nsupport the work of National Societies in this area.\\nImmunization\\nIn 2018, the IFRC supported National Societies to reach \\nthe world™s most vulnerable children with life-saving \\nvaccines, ensuring that community-level interven\\n-tions reached people in need. It supported capacity \\nbuilding for community engagement and social mobi\\n-lization that encourages immunization, and for more \\neffective support to vaccination campaigns and rou\\n-tine immunizations. It developed and disseminated \\nguidance and materials during measles campaigns \\nand other vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, and \\nprovided health promotion materials to communities \\non immunization. The IFRC also supported National \\nSocieties work with volunteers and staff to set-up \\nand deliver community-based health surveillance \\nsystems and build capacity for their outreach vacci\\n-nation work through mobile health clinics and their \\noutbreak response capacity for vaccine preventable \\ndiseases. Increase trust in vaccines and vaccination \\nprogrammes through effective communications with \\ncommunities was a key area of investment in 2018.\\nThe\\n Reference Centre for Psychosocial \\nSupport\\n, hosted by Danish Red Cross, \\nsupports National Societies to facilitate \\npsychosocial support before during and \\nafter disasters through awareness raising, \\nimproving preparedness and response \\nmechanisms, and restoring community \\nnetworks and coping mechanisms.\\nReproductive and \\nmaternal health\\nThe IFRC supported National Societies development of \\nevidence-based policy and capacity building activities \\non reproductive and maternal health. It also conducted \\nactivities to ensure quality assurance in emergencies \\n\\nand worked with partners on clinical standards in rou\\n-tine and emergency obstetric and new-born care. The \\nIFRC also delivered technical assistance and training \\non minimum standards and core competencies needed \\namong medical, midwifery and nursing staff and vol\\n-unteers in routine community care and emergencies.\\nThe IFRC continued to explore innovative tools and \\ndevices, such as the CRADLE Vital Sign Alert Device \\nwhich accurately measure blood pressure and heart \\nrate in order to assess the risk of developing shock.\\nActive outreach\\nIn 2018, the IFRC work on HIV/AIDs, tuberculosis (TB), \\ndrug abuse and on the health of migrants focused \\non reducing harm. It also produced guides on HIV in \\nEmergencies and on working with key populations.\\nThe global migration task force meeting in December \\n2018 was the culmination of the IFRC™s work on \\nthe health needs of migrants throughout the year. \\nActivities were undertaken to address the rights of \\nmigrants™ access to health services, humanitarian \\nassistance, violence and mental health concerns, \\nmaternal, child and adolescent health, and commu\\n-nicable and non-communicable diseases. Challenges \\nand best practices in working with local authorities \\n\\nand host communities were also addressed.\\nThe IFRC was actively engaged in preparations for the \\nUN high level meeting on Tuberculosis in September \\n2018. The intention was to strengthen the ˜nal out\\n-come document with consideration of community \\nand civil society perspectives. The IFRC worked with \\nNational Societies and the Stop TB Partnership to \\norganize ˜ve regional consultations and invited more \\nthan 200 stakeholders from the TB and TB/HIV com\\n-munities and patient organizations to consolidate \\n\\nmessages for national and global advocacy efforts.\\nTogether with TB Patients Organization ﬁTB Peopleﬂ, \\nthe IFRC developed a patient-to-patient guide on \\nwhat to expect during treatment and the period of \\nlong-term recovery was developed for TB patients. The \\nof˜cial launch of the publication took place in New \\nYork during the UN General Assembly.\\nThe IFRC and the Red Cross and Red Crescent \\nPartnership on Substance Abuse organized train\\n-ing in harm reduction/Substance Abuse for National \\nSocieties from Americas region in Rome.\\nThe impact of the increasing use of opioids was the \\nfocus of a good practice guide which included shared \\nexperiences of National Societies in responding to opi\\n-oid overdoses.\\nHealth\\nAlliance for Malaria Prevention (AMP) \\nand Malaria Coordination\\nThe IFRC serves as the secretariat of the Alliance for Malaria \\n\\n\\n\\nmalaria through mass distribution campaigns and continuous dis\\n-tribution channels. It develops and shares best practices, quality \\nstandards, lessons and recommendations for malaria prevention \\nwith insecticide-treated nets and supports the implementation of \\nnet distribution activities to strengthen skills and capacities at the \\ncountry level. As the chair of this global partnership, the IFRC helps \\n\\ncultivate openness and collaboration, acting as a neutral facilitator \\n\\n\\n-try, updated operational guidance \\non effective logistics, campaigning \\nand communications, particularly \\nin complex operating environments, \\nand organized training workshops \\nfor implementers on best practices.\\n\\n\\n-ticidal nets to people in 14 countries, \\nmainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Based \\non the Cochrane Review, which \\n\\n\\nsleeping under an insecticide-treat\\n-\\n\\nhave contributed to saving the lives \\nof more than 3 million people.\\nEmergency health\\nThe IFRC continued to provide support to the deploy\\n-ment of the network™s health Emergency Response \\nUnits (ERUs) throughout 2018, including hospitals and \\nhealth clinics. It conducted a number of risk assess\\n-ments to inform emergency operations, most notably \\nin response to the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic \\nRepublic of the Congo and the diphtheria outbreak \\nin Cox™s Bazaar in Bangladesh. The IFRC represented \\nthe network at global coordination meetings through\\n-out the year and worked with numerous National \\nSocieties to develop the IFRC Humanitarian Health \\nCompetency Matrix. This will ensure that the IFRC \\nNetwork can continue to deploy the right people, at \\nthe right time and to the right place when emergen\\n-cies occur.\\nThe IFRC conducted training for surge deployment to \\nemergency operations at global, regional and national \\nlevels. National Societies from all regions partici\\n-pated in IFRC leadership and coordination workshops \\non effective public health response in emergencies. \\nOnline training for staff of the IFRC and National \\nSocieties was developed and piloted on the Safer \\nAccess Framework, to help National Societies to con\\n-nect with other humanitarian partners on securing \\nsafe humanitarian access during emergencies.\\nWork was also conducted in 2018 on the creation of \\nsix Public Health Emergency Response Units led by \\nNational Societies with the support of the IFRC. These \\nERUs are designed to provide high quality, special\\n-ised response capacities in public health and to be \\ndeployed in support of other National Societies during \\noutbreaks and disasters.\\nInformation management and \\npublic health informatics\\nIn 2018, the IFRC™s public health and medical infor\\n-mation management activities continued with an \\nincreasing focus on data, evidence and accountability. \\nSupport was provided to the network on the design of \\ncommunity-based surveillance activities in a number \\nof countries, including Myanmar and Senegal. Work \\nwas also started in collaboration with the Norwegian \\nRed Cross to develop a community-based surveil\\n-lance tool that will systematically collect information \\nfor the new public health emergency response units. \\nFinally, in support of the medical response activities \\nof the network, the IFRC continued to work with part\\n-ners on the creation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent \\nHealth Information System.

In 2018, the \\nIFRC signi˜cantly expanded its work in emergency hygiene and men\\n-strual hygiene management Œ two areas which are continuing to gain \\ngreater attention across the network. Guidelines, online courses and \\ntraining packages were developed for emergency hygiene promotion and \\nmenstrual hygiene management in emergency and long-term program\\n-ming to support National Societies in expanding their knowledge and \\ncapacity on these issues.\\nThe newly developed IFRC guidelines on menstrual hygiene management \\naim to support National Societies in the design and implementation of \\nprogrammes and operations that address the menstrual hygiene needs of \\nwomen and girls.

The process for the devel\\n-opment of these tools, the creation of a menstrual hygiene management \\ncommunity of practice and the delivery of dedicated training has resulted \\nin strong collaboration across WASH, health and protection, gender and \\ninclusion experts across the network and among external partners. \\nImproved coordination, information exchange and the standardisation \\nof tools are crucial elements that ensure no women or girl is marginalised \\n\\nor deprived of opportunity or dignity as a result of menstruation.\\nWASH in Urban Contexts\\nWASH services to urban contexts occur in both developmental and emergency scenarios. In response \\nto the growing challenges of WASH in urban contexts, the IFRC coordinated the development of the \\nnetwork™s strategic direction on this issue, which began a dedicated process to further engage with \\nother sectors that focus on the increasing needs of the urban poor. A technical guidance note on Urban \\nWASH was developed in 2018 and shared widely within the network.

The UN Of˜ce for the \\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) esti\\n-mated that 2.6 million people faced food insecurity, \\nand 3 million people lacked access to clean water \\nbecause of the drought.\\nIn response, the Kenya Red Cross Society launched \\na cash response covering 13 counties affected by \\ndrought. It was estimated that around 25 per cent of \\nthe programme™s participants did not own govern\\n-ment IDs. Since proof of identity is a requirement \\nfor access to the M-Pesa system being used, as it is \\nfor other national banking services, people without \\ngovernment-recognized identi˜cation are unable to \\nreceive assistance directly and have to do so instead \\nthrough a designated third-party, proxy recipient.\\nThe IFRC and the Kenya Red Cross Society are ˜nd\\n-ing innovative ways to address this challenge. In May \\n2018, a pilot project was conducted in Is iolo County \\nusing tools developed by the IFRC™s private-sector \\npartner RedRose. This included a bene˜ciary data \\nmanagement system linked to blockchain to record \\ncash distribution transactions. The pilot, while \\nfocused initially on government ID holders, explored \\nthe use of digital IDs to further expand of the project \\n\\nto people without of˜cial IDs.\\nThe learning from this initiative will contribute to \\nthe longer-term application of blockchain technol\\n-ogy and high levels of transparency and protection \\nagainst fraud, while broadening the reach of cash pro\\n-gramming, including for people previously excluded \\nor unable to access assistance directly because of a \\nlack of IDs.\\nCapacity development:\\nŁ Conducted a thorough systems audit \\nto ensure that ˜nance, logistics and \\nIT systems are cash ready.\\nŁ Signed a two-year framework agreement with \\nRed Rose for access to data management \\nsupport for all National Societies.\\nŁ Commenced the WFP/IFRC support to National \\nSociety capacity development programme \\nfor cash in two National Society contexts.\\nThe IFRC co-chairs the Cash Peer Working Group with \\nthe ICRC.

The \\nIFRC is working with the British \\nRed Cross and Pakistan Red \\nCrescent Society to develop \\nthe idea and has convened \\nin˚uential Islamic Financing \\nleaders to pledge support.\\nNational Society Asset \\nManagement\\nUnderutilized and illiquid \\nassets, such as land or property, \\nmay help National Societies \\nin becoming more ˜nancially \\nself-suf˜cient. The IFRC has been \\nexploring the raising of ˜nance \\nagainst trading income or revenue \\ngenerating activity, to support \\ninvestment or core activities.\\nFor example, the Kenya Red \\nCross owns and operates \\nthree hotels to fund some \\nhumanitarian activities. The \\nGIFT identi˜ed the ˜nancing \\nof these hotels as instruments \\nthat could be reviewed to ensure \\nthey are ef˜cient, appropriate \\nand optimised. The IFRC \\nbegan to work with the hotel™s \\nmanagement team in 2018 to \\ndevelop the concept, to agree \\naims and project timelines. \\nLed by the Kenya Red Cross, \\nGIFT is now developing the \\ninvestment case, building \\n˜nancial models and presenting \\nthe concept to existing and \\npotential new lenders.\\nCatastrophe Bond\\nA Catastrophe Bond (or CAT \\nBond) is an insurance-based \\nmechanism that transfers risk \\nfrom donors to capital markets, \\nthereby accelerating the release \\nof disaster funding, potentially \\nbefore a major disaster, activating \\nnew pools of capital, such as \\ncapital markets, pension funds, \\nprivate placements which \\nhad previously inaccessible \\nto the IFRC Network, and \\ndeveloping a scalable, reusable \\ntransactional platform that \\ncould mobilize millions in \\nhumanitarian assistance.\\nIn 2018, led by the Danish \\nRed Cross, the GIFT worked \\nwith investors, volcanologists, \\nclimatologists, and network \\ncolleagues to create a framework \\nfor a Volcano CAT Bond. Since \\nthen, addressable volcanoes have \\nbeen identi˜ed in South America, \\nOceania, and Asia. Some 15 \\nmillion US dollars has been \\nsecured in soft commitments \\nfrom investors, and investment \\nterms and triggers for the release \\nof funding have been agreed.

The \\ngoal is to leverage grant funding \\nwith private capital to ˜nance \\napproximately CHF 100 million to \\ncut cholera-related deaths by 90 \\nper cent over the next 10 years.\\nGIFT worked with IsDB \\nthroughout 2018 on One WASH \\nand have secured (pro-bono) \\n˜nancial advisers (HSBC & \\nFAB) and legal counsel (White \\n& Case) to provide support \\nin structuring the Sukuk.\\nThe structure was presented \\nat the IsDB AGM in Morocco in \\nearly April. The IFRC and the \\nIsDB began to engage other \\nstakeholders, including at the \\nResponsible Financing and \\nInvestment summit and through \\nan investors summit held in \\nLondon with the British Red \\nCross. Approximately CHF 40 \\nmillion in pledges towards the \\ninitiative and related projects \\nhave been received so far.\\n153\\nInnovation\\nIFRC and Zakat\\nThe IFRC and the Kenya Red Cross launched an international emer\\n-gency appeal to raise funds for one of the worst droughts in Kenya™s \\nhistory. The goal was to provide people in Kitui, the worst affected \\ndistrict in Kenya, with access to water, food and health care, and to \\nhelp them to recover and rebuild their lives. The IFRC worked with \\nthe Zakat Council of the Malaysian State of Perlis (Majlis Agama \\nIslam dan Adat Istiadat Melayu Perlis, or MAIPS) to secure zakat \\nfunding to the drought assistance programme because MAIPS has \\na track record of using Islamic Social Finance instruments such as \\nzakat for the bene˜t of communities in need.\\nThe district was eligible for funding by MAIPS because:\\n1An assessment by the Kenya Red Cross and the Red Cross \\nRed Crescent Climate Centre identi˜ed people here as being \\nin clear need of humanitarian assistance, and therefore \\nquali˜ed under the asnaf (categories of people eligible for \\nzakat distribution).\\n2Funding the initiative was an opportunity to change \\nperceptions and demonstrate that zakat contributions \\ncan be used for international humanitarian and \\ndevelopment projects.\\n3The project had the potential to show that Islamic Social \\nFinance can create sustained impact and shared prosperity \\nas well as provide charitable disaster relief.\\nThe programme developed by the Kenya Red Cross used a \\ntwo-pronged approach to tackle water access and cash crop issues \\nsimultaneously. It included the repairing of existing bore holes \\nand pumps and the installation of new ones, to bring the total to \\n30. These provide clean water, as well as livelihood opportunities \\nin selling and distributing water. The funds also allowed the pur\\n-chase of certi˜ed green gram seeds that were distributed to 175,000 \\nsubsistence farming families. The two kilogrammes given to each \\nfamily were anticipated to yield around 180 kilogrammes of har\\n-vest, with a market value of around 1 US dollar per kilogramme.\\nZakat is an annual \\n\\ntax obligation for Muslims.\\nImpact\\nAs a result of the zakat-supported intervention:\\nŁ Water kiosks and distribution businesses are providing \\nemployment and funding for the ongoing maintenance of \\nthe water pumps.\\nŁ Cash raised from the sale of green gram has enabled the \\npurchase of more seeds for the next crop and provided \\n\\nfor the welfare of the community in terms of food, health \\n\\ncare and education.\\nŁ The farmers of Kitui have agreed to pay back the cost of \\nthe initial two kilogrammes of seed they received. This \\n\\nmakes those funds available again for investment in \\n\\nthe neighbouring county of Garissa, which is suffering \\n\\nsimilar levels of hardship. In keeping with the zakat \\n\\nprinciples, the initial recipient has become a contributor.\\nŁ The IFRC and MAIPs showed how zakat can be applied \\ninnovatively to international humanitarian assistance \\n\\nto people of all faiths and backgrounds.\\nThe following areas were identi˚ed in 2018 for  \\n\\nfurther exploration:\\nŁ social Impact Bonds for international projects (e.g. \\nearly education in Rwanda) and domestic priorities \\n\\n(e.g. Post hospital recovery for disadvantaged \\n\\ncommunities)\\nŁ social investment to support the reorganization  \\nand development of new business lines (Mobility Aid \\n\\nServices, Events First Aid and Refugee Services)\\nŁ the transfer of National Societies™ insurance to \\nreinsurance providers, so that additional premiums \\n\\ncan be used to reduce human suffering\\nAccess to clean water and \\nsustainable cash crops was \\nmade possible for more than  \\n1 million people in Kitui. \\nInnovation\\nLed by the Kenya Red Cross, the GIFT is \\nmentoring and partnering with National \\nSocieties and governments in Africa to \\nhelp build sustainable businesses, such \\nas by supporting the Gambian Red \\nCross Society to set-up an ambulance \\nrescue company. Agreement on the \\n\\n-\\nnalized and the process has begun to \\n\\n\\n-bulances, and to select and train per\\n-sonnel. This will provide income to sup\\n-port the humanitarian activities of the \\nGambian Red Cross Society and perhaps \\ncreate opportunities for future collabora\\n-tion on other business models.

It \\nputs communities at the centre by \\nensuring they have information about \\nour programmes/operations/services \\navailable, that that all we do is based \\non their feedback/inputs and that they \\nare able to participate in all decisions \\naffecting them. \\nCapacity Building and Stronger \\nEmergency Response Systems \\nThe Movement CEA guide and \\ntoolkit\\n continues to be widely adopted \\nacross the network. The toolkit helps National Societies to assess, \\ndesign, implement, monitor and evaluate community engagement \\nand accountability activities in support of programmes and oper\\n-ations. Regional training events were organized in the Americas \\nand in Africa in 2018 to strengthen the capacity of more than 40 \\nNational Societies. As part of the Surge Optimization process and \\noperational excellence approach, the IFRC built in 2018 a sustain\\n-able network of skilled community engagement experts who can be \\ndeployed during emergencies. IFRC also created a feedback-starter \\nkit to support National Societies in setting up simple yet effective \\nfeedback mechanisms in different types of contexts.\\nFrom tracking migrant perceptions in Italy to collecting feed\\n-back from host and guest communities in Cox™s Bazar, IFRC and \\nGround Truth Solutions have worked together to support National \\nSocieties in establishing feedback mechanisms. IFRC and Ground \\nTruth Solutions, have launched a guide on ‚™How to Establish and \\nManage Systematic Community Feedback Mechanism™™ based on \\nwork conducted as part of the migration crisis in Europe with sev\\n-eral National Societies.\\n\\nMaking \\nThe wider humanitarian system still struggles to show how feed\\n-back from communities can in˚uence better decision-making. \\nThe IFRC Network is uniquely positioned within communities to \\ncollect and analyse feedback, perceptions, rumours, concerns or \\ncomplaints from affected people, which can elevate the voice of \\ncommunities at the collective level and in˚uence decision-making \\nprocesses. IFRC has led on creating feedback data standards and \\nsimple innovative systems so that feedback can be aggregated, ana\\n-lysed and responded to in a timely manner. \\nIFRC initiated a unique and innovative community feedback mon\\n-itoring system as part of the Ebola response in the Democratic \\nRepublic of the Congo, which collects, analyses and visualizes com\\n-munity concerns, feedback, and rumours to inform decision-making \\nprocesses. Thanks to a partnership with the Center for Disease \\nControl and OCHA™s Centre for Humanitarian Data, an online dash\\n-board was created to share community data more ef˜ciently with \\nall response partners and encourage course correction. IFRC is plan\\n-ning to scale up this system in other responses. \\nCommunity Engagement and Accountability\\nBased on a \\nrecent study\\n on the work of the Kenya Red Cross, community engagement support/initiatives have \\nled to greater trust and involvement of communities resulting in increased sustainability. \\nCox™s Bazar (Bangladesh):\\n Regular perception studies with the camp communities demonstrated that the major\\n-ity of people preferred to receive cash-based assistance or vouchers, as well as cooking fuel. In response to these \\n˜ndings, the Bangladesh Red Crescent (with IFRC) was one of the ˜rst humanitarian organizations to pilot a \\nproject with unconditional cash grants and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) for both guest and host communities.\\nCommunities\\nRed Cross Volunteers\\nCommunity engagement in the most affected locations\\n(household visits [Monday, Wednesday, Friday] and community mobilization activities\\nFeedback\\n(including rumours, beliefs, observations, questions, and suggestions \\nappreciation/encouragment and refusals) is recorded on the form\\nCommunity Engagement Supervisors\\ndata entry volunteers record all data into Excel forms\\nSupervisors \\nData Entry\\n\\nRaw data are \\n\\nshared regularly\\nHDX OCHA Team\\n\\nOnline Dashboard\\n(data by healthzone)\\nData shared with all \\n\\nebola response partners \\n\\nto inform action\\nIFRC CEA & IMCoordinators\\nInitial review \\n\\nand submission\\nCDC Atlanta\\n\\nQuality \\n\\nassurance and \\n\\ninterpretation \\nIncluding coding, \\nrevision, \\n\\ntranslation into \\n\\nEnglish, and \\n\\nanalsys reports\\nIM assistantsCoding of data \\nExcel Spreadsheet \\nand dashboard \\n\\n(more granular \\n\\ndata)\\nBased on data analysis, Red \\n\\nCross community \\n\\nengagement staff shares \\n\\nthe main trends to inform \\n\\nthe community \\n\\nengagement focus and \\n\\napproach, including main \\n\\nmessages and answers to \\n\\ncritical questions\\nIFRC Community \\n\\nEngagement \\n\\nDelegates\\n\\nInitial review \\n\\nand submission\\nALL EFFECTED HEALTH ZONES\\nBENI COORDINATION HUB\\nATLANTA\\nA Movement-Wide Approach \\nMany National Societies have made great progress in making community engagement their standard way of \\nworking and are share lessons and strengthening collaboration. In 2018, IFRC launched the process for an \\nevidence-based research on the impact of community engagement to build a theory of change. Together with \\nICRC, IFRC drafted in 2018 Minimum Commitments and Actions ahead of the 2019 Council of Delegates, to sup\\n-port the Movement in integrating approaches for better accountability to affected people in all its work.\\n AFRICA\\nFrom epidemics like Ebola to food crises, needs in Africa remain immense. \\n\\nresources to enhance programming, community involvement and leadership.\\nRegional Risks\\nThe scale of humanitarian needs in Africa remains \\nimmense. Hunger, armed con˚ict and Ebola virus disease \\noutbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo stand out \\namong the most devastating crises in 2018. Food inse\\n-curity in East and Southern Africa has also severely \\nthreatened the lives, livelihoods, and resilience of peo\\n-ple and their communities. The IFRC must operate across \\nthe continent in environments suffering from recurrent \\nhazards, protracted food crises, epidemics, and con˚ict, \\nand provide long-term solutions to recurrent risks that \\nstrengthen the resilience of communities.\\nAfrica\\nChallenges to Humanitarian \\nAssistance\\nThe main challenges hampering humanitarian assistance in 2018 \\nin Africa were primarily related to the imbalance of extraordinary \\nneeds and the limited ˜nancial and operational capacity of National \\nSocieties. Unlike other regions, the capacity of African National \\nSocieties and African governments to contribute ˜nancially to \\noperations in neighbouring countries in the region is extremely \\nlimited. This context compounds the already poor ˜nancial sit\\n-uation and weak ˜nancial management systems of many of the \\nNational Societies. It requires aggressive fundraising from outside \\nthe region and intense oversight or daily support from the IFRC. \\nThe governance and leadership abilities of National Societies and \\nthe technical abilities of volunteers require signi˜cant investment \\n\\nto develop and improve. Logistics capacities across the continent \\nare also low.\\n\\nGuided by the IFRC™s Strategy 2020, and the Africa Road Map \\n2017Œ2020, the IFRC is committed to assisting African National \\nSocieties to achieve results in all seven Areas of Focus.\\n\\nSocieties to increase their capacity to anticipate and prepare \\nfor disasters in order to save more lives, reduce the impact \\nof disasters and the cost of emergency response. The IFRC \\nsupported National Societies in partnership with communities \\n\\neffective at building long-term resilience.\\nBy leveraging the IFRC™s collective capacity and by sharing \\naccountability with National Societies in Africa, the IFRC \\naugmented and expanded the scope and scale of its support, \\n\\naccelerated capacity strengthening of its members, and \\nenhanced services for vulnerable communities.\\nThis approach was underpinned by the following priority \\nprinciples:\\n to be closer to National Societies through the provision of \\npractical services for shared leadership with and tangible \\n\\n\\n to design all activities and milestones so that they reinforce \\nthe centrality of National Society development with a \\n\\nfocus on branches, and to ensure greater investment in \\nstrengthening National Societies as essential local actors\\n to shift from short-term and project-based funding to \\nmulti-year, thematic funding where Partner National \\nSocieties work together on aligned National Societies plans\\n to recognize that while saving lives remains an \\nessential responsibility of the IFRC and National \\nSocieties, that we must also strive to reduce need, and \\nwork towards a more resilient world, where dignity \\nis cherished and fewer lives are disrupted or ended \\n\\n to commit to measurable results, such as \\ndemonstrating improved capacity within at \\nleast 35 National Societies by 2020\\nAfrica\\nEmergency Response\\n\\nand Central Africa were responsible for the \\ngreatest number of IFRC emergency responses. \\nOf the 28 Disaster Relief Emergency Fund al\\n-locations and six Emergency Appeals in Africa, \\n\\nepidemics.

The survey showed that where there was an \\nincrease in revenue and support from partner National Societies \\nsigni˜cant progress could be achieved.\\nThe Regional Of˜ce was able to improve in areas where it had pre\\n-viously struggled, such as on compliance with minimum security \\nregulations and the speed of recruitment although the greatest \\nprogress was made on Health and Care, Livelihoods and Disaster \\nRisk Reduction. Epidemic preparedness and prevention partner\\n-ships were established to support and strengthen engagement \\nwith the Global Task Force on Cholera, whose secretariat is hosted \\nby the World Health Organization. As a result, a joint statement \\nwas drafted to encourage participating member States™, partners™ \\nand donors™ ownership, commitment and accountability, and their \\nengagement in addressing cholera at the regional, sub-regional and \\nnational levels.\\nDespite Shelter, Protection, Gender and Inclusion being rated low\\n-est in the survey, progress was still made. Prior to 2018, there was \\nno shelter or gender and inclusion focal point. However, the sit\\n-uation has been addressed and staff have been instrumental in \\nlaying down the strategy and framework that will help achieve the \\n2019 objectives. However, improvements are still needed. Migration, \\nresource mobilization for the Lake Chad Basin and the building of \\nresilience in Southern Africa require more resources and atten\\n-tion in 2019.\\nIn 2018, the Africa \\n\\nprovided support \\nto National \\nSocieties under all \\nfour strategies for \\nimplementation (SFI).\\n\\n\\n\\nresilience programmes throughout the region.\\n \\nAfrica\\nSupporting National \\nSocietiesEstablishing relevant \\ncoordination mechanisms\\nThe Joint Task Force meetings chaired by the regional \\ncoordination team were an opportunity for IFRC \\ncountry operations teams to share situation analy\\n-ses and operational updates with the Regional Of˜ce \\nand teams in Geneva; to identify operational chal\\n-lenges, and; to promote lessons and best practices. \\nThe operations coordinators also organized regu\\n-lar meetings with ˜eld operations, country teams, \\nclusters, regional and global stakeholders to ensure \\nadequate coordination. These meetings focussed on \\nresource mobilization for recurring disasters and on \\nmitigating security risks. Regular Movement Partners™ \\n\\nmeetings were also organized to inform partners and \\nseek funding for country-based operations. In addi\\n-tion, regional teams leveraged technical resources \\nfrom various units when providing regional operation \\nservices, including technical teams from Programme \\nOperations, Partnerships and Resource Development, \\n\\nCommunications, PMER and Finance.\\nProviding timely and context-\\n\\ncountry operations\\nThe diversity of technical pro˜les represented within \\nthe regional coordination team has ensured highly \\nrelevant and timely support to country operation \\nteams, in line with their most urgent needs. The \\nregional Operations Coordinator has been closely \\ninvolved with each operation in Africa to provide \\noperational guidance and to ensure quality control \\nfor new Emergency Appeals, guiding operational \\nplanning, rapidly ˜nding (surge) solutions for human \\nresources™ gaps and conducting ˜nancial reporting. \\nThematic experts have been providing continuous \\nadvice and practical tools from Nairobi and have been \\ndeployed for one to four weeks to provide training and \\nsupport with planning, implementing and monitoring \\nfood crisis operations.\\n\\nThrough an approach the region calls ﬁBranches as \\nCentres of Resilienceﬂ the IFRC has improved the \\ntargeting and driving of support to those branches \\non the front-line of the most severe crises, includ\\n-ing food security. The IFRC has provided National \\nSocieties in Africa with material support to become \\nstronger at managing national and local disas\\n-ters, such as communications equipment to the \\nSouth Sudan Red Cross HQ and to the branches \\ninvolved in the food crisis operation. IFRC success \\nin National Society Development was recognized \\nby National Societies in the region through a satis\\n-faction survey, in which they highlighted support to \\nleadership and governance, ˜nancial management \\nand volunteer management. The IFRC also facilitated \\npractical skills-building sessions on information man\\n-agement and data visualization in Somaliland and \\nNigeria, training on Planning, Monitoring, Evaluating \\nand Reporting (PMER) in Nigeria and Sahel, on \\nCommunity Engagement and Accountability (CEA) \\nin Ethiopia, South Sudan, Nigeria and Somalia, and \\nlessons-learned workshops in Ethiopia, Southern \\nAfrica and Sahel. It also provided support and advice \\nfor the conducting of Post-Distribution Monitoring \\nwith the development of questionnaires and meth\\n-odologies, and the provision of guidance notes with \\npractical tips.\\nMaintaining a strong focus on resilience and community ownership\\nThe IFRC provided technical guidance to IFRC Country \\nOf˜ces, Country Cluster Support Teams and National \\nSocieties on integrating long-term community resil\\n-ience perspectives into food crisis operations. This \\n\\nincluded revising Emergency Plans of Actions and \\npromoting innovative approaches that strengthen the \\ncapacity of communities to prepare for, respond to \\nand recover from environmental, social and economic \\ndisasters and shocks.\\nAfrica\\nConsolidating and using \\noperational data and \\nmonitoring information\\nIn 2018, the IFRC developed its ˚agship data \\nvisualization program called the Africa \\nOperations Room that was launched to \\nsupport operations and National Society \\ndevelopment. This tool facilitates infor\\n-mation sharing and decision making by \\nmapping, for example, key data related to \\npartner National Society and IFRC assets \\nin the region, National Society profiles, \\nstrategic human resource plans. The IFRC \\nprovided support to emergency operations \\nin Somalia and Nigeria for the integration \\nof Information Management within their \\n\\noperations and on the implementation of \\ninternal ˜le sharing systems. Secondary \\ndata analysis products were developed for \\nSouth Sudan and Somalia while regional \\ncoordination tools, such as the Food \\nSecurity Dashboard, were also developed \\nand fed in part by country operations and \\nregional teams. The dashboard hosts key ˜g\\n-ures and documents for country operations, \\nsuch as Regional Situation Reports; Who is \\ndoing What, Where (3Ws) maps; Risk Watch \\nsituational analysis per country of focus; \\nFood Security Outlooks; Appeals™ Overview; \\nexperiences, examples and good practices; \\nand references to Food Security resources. \\nTo enhance coordination, monitoring and \\ninformation sharing, 15 Regional Situational \\nReports were produced in collaboration with \\ncountry operation teams. The IFRC also \\nworked to improve reporting products and to \\npromote best practices and successes with \\n\\npartners, donors, and other stakeholders \\nthrough country operations™ fact sheets. It \\nconducted reviews and evaluations of oper\\n-ations as well as lessons-learned exercises, \\nsuch as the 2018 Sahel DREF review and the \\n2017 Southern Africa operations evaluation, \\nin order to inform future operations and \\nmore effective food crisis response tools.\\nLeveraging existing competencies \\nthrough peer-to-peer support \\nand partnerships\\nTo reinforce the overall technical expertise and capacity related \\nto food crisis preparedness and response in the Africa region, \\n\\nthe IFRC regional food crisis coordination team co-organized \\nregular cross-context learning exercises. This involved, among \\nothers, an IFRC/OCHA HDX data skills workshop for human\\n-itarian ˜eld staff in March 2018 and a regional workshop on \\nCommunity Engagement and Communication with OCHA, \\nUNICEF and other partners in May 2018. Such activities have \\nhelped to disseminate best practices, to enhance learning on \\neffective operational approaches and to increase ef˜ciency by \\navoiding duplicate efforts. The IFRC also made use of exist\\n-ing skills within African National Societies to support sister \\nNational Societies, for example by enabling quick deployments \\nof RDRTs to food crisis operations.\\nAMERICAS\\nThe Americas face a myriad of challenges from natural disasters, to non-\\ncommunicable diseases and population movement. IFRC provides necessary \\ncoordination and technical support to National Societies for numerous disaster \\noperations and development programmes throughout the region.\\nRegional Risks\\nMost countries in the Americas are vulnerable to natural phe\\n-nomena. Earthquakes, droughts, ˚oods, hurricanes and volcanic \\neruptions have been responsible for the loss of more than 300,000 \\nlives and 20 billion US dollars in the last three decades and have \\naffected the lives of more than 15 million people. Climate change \\nis exacerbating these risks and is contributing to food insecurity, \\nwater-borne diseases and lack of access to safe water. The region \\nis also experiencing accelerated urbanization which is heightening \\nvulnerabilities such as violence in all its forms, traf˜c accidents, \\nthe concentration and proliferation of slums, and a wide range of \\nenvironmental problems, such as poor sanitation, water pollution, \\nand deforestation.\\nIn matters of health, chronic or non-communicable diseases are \\nthe greatest cause of premature death, morbidity and disability in \\nthe Americas causing two of every three deaths in the region and \\n\\nthreatening economic development. This situation is complicated by \\nextreme inequity in access to health services, particularly among \\nindigenous populations. Also concerning is the impact of epidemic \\noutbreaks including dengue fever, chikungunya, cholera and more \\nrecently Zika.\\nThe Americas region is home to 27 per cent of the world™s migrants \\n(62 million people), and complex population movement has a sig\\n-ni˜cant impact on equity, social cohesion and local and regional \\neconomies. Both Guatemala and Venezuela experienced political \\nand social tension in 2018, with many Venezuelans seeking refuge \\n\\nacross the region. Furthermore, the ˚ow of refugee and migrant \\nchildren from Central America who are trying to reach the United \\nStates shows no sign of abating, despite the dangers of travel and \\nthe tightening of immigration measures. Signi˜cant increases in \\nextra-continental migration have also taken place in recent years, \\nparticularly from Africa and Asia into Latin America, and irregular \\nmigratory ˚ows from the Caribbean have also increased, particu\\n-larly from Cuba and Haiti.\\n2018\\nAMERICAS OPERATIONAL \\nPLANS\\n698,658*\\nPEOPLE REACHED IN 2018\\n14.5 MILLION FOR AOF\\n6.2 MILLION FOR SFI\\nAspirational funding \\nrequirement 2018\\nCHF 20.7 million\\ncoverge of 79%\\n44,496\\nDisaster Risk \\nReduction\\n42,781\\nShelter\\n95,972Livelihoods &\\nBasic Needs411,894\\nHealth\\n79,905\\nWater, Sanitation,\\nHygiene\\n20,044\\nProtection, Gender &\\n\\nInclusion\\n86,412\\nMigration\\n* Total without double counting\\nThe resilience continuum:             preparedness,               crisis,       relief,                      recovery,                   long-term developmentAmericas\\n\\nPriorities\\nThe Americas Regional Office sup\\n-ports 35 National Societies in North, \\nCentral and South America, as well as \\nin the English and Spanish-speaking \\nCaribbean.

These efforts have \\nhelped to improve disaster relief access and \\nhave led to import tax and customs relief for \\nsupplies in several countries.\\nWith the support of the IFRC, six National \\nSocieties included a communications com\\n-ponent within their humanitarian plans and \\na multidisciplinary group on humanitarian \\ndiplomacy was established in Honduras and in \\nCosta Rica.\\nThe IFRC trained National Society personnel in \\nlegislative advocacy, auxiliary role and disaster \\n\\nlaw and communication, and supported them \\nto complete ˜ve legislative advocacy research \\nprojects that included a checklist on domestic \\n\\npreparedness in Ecuador and IDRL reports in \\nDominica, Honduras and El Salvador.\\nSeven inter-governmental, inter-agency and \\nacademic fora actively engaged on IFRC leg\\n-islative advocacy issues, and three legislative \\nadvocacy activities were undertaken for \\ninter-governmental, inter-agency and aca\\n-demic fora including May 2018 Lima Workshop, \\nNovember 2018 Costa Rica Workshop and \\nDecember 2018 with OCHA.\\nA number of external media articles/broadcasts \\nwere released that featured the legislative advo\\n-cacy work of the IFRC and/or National Societies.\\nSix National Societies became engaged in legis\\n-lative advocacy activities, as well as providing \\neducation and training for branches, and sup\\n-port was provided for National Societies with \\nnew materials and methodologies in a legisla\\n-tive advocacy toolkit.\\nA regional workshop on Humanitarian Law, \\nDisaster Law and Legislative Defence was held \\nin May 2018.\\nASIA PACIFIC\\nProtracted crises are leading to reduced humanitarian access. The IFRC supports \\nNational Societies to ensure that life-saving assistance reaches vulnerable people \\nwhile providing support towards the development of regional National Societies.\\nRegional Risks\\nAn increasing challenge to the work of the IFRC \\nNetwork in the Asia Paci˜c region is reduced human\\n-itarian access, especially in cases of protracted \\ncrises. Where access to people in need is impeded \\nor denied because of the political environment this \\nthreatens the IFRC™s humanitarian imperatives and \\nmandate to help the most vulnerable.\\nThe IFRC is dedicated to ensuring that assistance \\nreaches the most vulnerable communities while \\navoiding fragmented action, duplication of effort \\nand the wasting of resources. Additionally, reduced \\nengagement by volunteers reinforces the impact \\n\\nof volunteers as an important component of a \\nwell-staffed workforce that must be ready to effec\\n-tively implement programmes.\\nEspecially in complex situations, the IFRC Network \\nmust remain responsive in order to reach and sup\\n-port vulnerable people in a timely, adaptable and \\neffective manner while maintaining integrity and \\naccountability. In order to do this IFRC systems \\nneed to be robust which, in turn, helps secure sus\\n-tainable funding. However, risk-averse approaches, \\nincluding onerous compliance measures, can \\ncause problems with the implementation of cash \\nprogramming and the localization of action \\nfor example.\\n\\n\\nStrengthening National Societies\\nA two-year joint IFRC and American Red Cross Red Ready initiative to sup\\n-port the development of nine National Societies was boosted by a grant of 2 \\nmillion US dollars from USAID (OFDA). This was the largest amount of the\\n-matic funding received in 2018 in the region. The initiative aims to provide \\nthe National Societies with the necessary resources and support to acceler\\n-ate their capacity development efforts, ensure deeper engagement with local \\ncommunities and stakeholders, and improve the effectiveness and ef˜ciency \\nof humanitarian response.\\nThe IFRC directly supported National Societies in Bangladesh, East Timor, \\nIndonesia, India, Laos, Mongolia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India with their \\n˜nancial sustainability, spending and assessment management efforts. The \\nIFRC also provided National Societies with training and interventions to sup\\n-port fundraising initiatives, as well as workshops, orientation exercises and \\nthe creation of 404 peer to peer support initiatives on several other aspects \\nof their work, a fourfold increase from 100 in 2017.\\nAll Asia Paci˜c Country and Cluster of˜ce operational plans are committed to \\nsupporting National Societies to enhance their ˜nancial controls. Dedicated \\nIFRC Finance Development staff were stationed within the National Societies \\nof Indonesia, Timor Leste, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Bangladesh and, in collabo\\n-ration with the American Red Cross, in the Paci˜c. A specialized company \\nprovided ˜nance development support to the National Society in Afghanistan. \\nDirect and dedicated support was provided by the IFRC to improve the Papua \\nNew Guinea National Society™s ˜nancial controls. That support ended in July \\n2018 due a lack of funds and has since been provided from the Asia Paci˜c \\nRegional Of˜ce. Support was also provided to the development and orien\\n-tation of National Society leaders from Tuvalu, New Zealand, Papua New \\nGuinea and Australia.\\nEffective disaster management\\nThe IFRC provided support to National Societies and engaged directly in the \\nresponse to humanitarian disasters in the Asia Paci˜c region. In 2018, multi\\n-ple earthquakes in Lombok, a major earthquake, tsunami and liquefaction in \\nSulawesi, and a tsunami in Sunda Straits together resulted in the deadliest \\ncombination of disasters in a single country. Rather than request interna\\n-tional assistance, the Government of Indonesia only welcomed humanitarian \\nassistance that met their speci˜cations, pushing international humanitarian \\nactors to deliver on localization commitments.\\nIn Afghanistan, the IFRC worked with National Societies to launch an oper\\n-ation to address the plight of 2.2 million people affected by a major drought \\n\\nand resulting internal displacement. In the Rakhine State of Myanmar and \\nin areas of Bangladesh the IFRC also delivered a One Window Framework \\nthrough a Shared Leadership approach to intensify coordination, build \\nresponse capabilities, and develop partnerships to respond to the mass dis\\n-placement of people.\\nDisaster risk reduction\\nThe IFRC supported National Societies to strengthen their capacities to work with vulnerable communities to \\nprepare for and respond to disasters, and to adopt practices that are informed by climate risks and are environ\\n-mentally responsible. The Red Cross and Red Crescent Stakeholder Group contributed to the Asian Ministerial \\nConference on Disaster Risk Reduction in July 2018. The network played a signi˜cant role in the preparations \\nfor and during the conference, which resulted in the Ulaanbaatar Declaration and the Action Plan 2018Œ2020 to \\naccelerate the implementation of the Sendai Framework in the region. Several of the 17 Asia Paci˜c case studies \\npublished in ﬁRed Cross and Red Crescent Disaster Risk Reduction in ActionŠWhat Works at Local Levelﬂ demon\\n-strating the IFRC Network™s contribution to climate-smart disaster risk reduction action, were presented in the \\nconference™s technical and thematic events. Through the Red Cross and Red Crescent Action Statement, the Red \\nCross and Red Crescent Stakeholder Group committed to scale-up evidence-based climate-smart disaster risk \\nreduction programmes to have greater impact, through collective approaches and partnerships.\\nPart of the conference commitments include establishing partnerships and increasing investment in \\npeople-centred, evidence-informed early warning early action such as Early Action Protocols to make \\nNational Societies ready for Forecast-based Financing. Signi˜cant advances in the development of Early Action \\nProtocols took place in Bangladesh, Mongolia, Philippines and Viet Nam, while there was also progress toward \\nforecast-based action in the Solomon Islands, Nepal and Indonesia.\\n\\nEmergency Response\\nEmergency Appeals were launched in 2018 for ˚ash ˚oods in \\nLaos, earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and Typhoon \\nMangkhut in the Philippines. There were a total of 25 DREF \\noperations issued and eight active Emergency Appeals as \\n\\nof December 2018. All the appeals included objectives/out\\n-comes and funding to enhance local branch development.\\nAs part of the process to ensure more effective IFRC \\nemergency response, action has been taken to enhance \\nreadiness capacity in IFRC™s cluster of˜ces in Bangkok, \\nBeijing, Jakarta and Suva, and in the country of˜ces \\nof Afghanistan, DPRK, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, \\nPhilippines and Timor Leste. Gender has been main\\n-streamed by the IFRC in disaster response operations \\nand is better re˚ected in DREFs and Emergency \\nAppeals. The IFRC has also ensured more system\\n-atic and structured training for surge response.\\n\\n\\nNovember 2018\\nThe Manila Declaration was a commitment by the leaders of the National Societies of the Asia \\n\\n\\n under \\n\\nand monitor their implementation.\\nManila Declaration Targets:\\n At least 50 per cent of the elected and appointed leadership of the \\nNational Societies and IFRC governance are women.\\n At least 70 per cent of National Societies join the One \\nBillion Coalition for Resilience (1BC) by 2022.\\n At least 50 per cent of National Societies have a diverse representation of \\nvolunteers in leadership and governance with a particular focus on youth.\\n Establish a community of practice for income-generating \\nactivities and social entrepreneurship.\\n The IFRC and all National Societies develop mechanisms \\nand tools to attract and retain volunteers.\\n 100 per cent of National Societies use appropriate connectivity \\ntools considering their national and local context.\\n \\n 100 per cent of National Societies and the IFRC roll out the Protection, \\nGender and Inclusion (PGI) Minimum Standards in their operations.\\n At least 75 per cent of National Societies integrate the needs of migrants, refugees and \\n\\nassessments and the development of migration policies and strategies where relevant.\\n At least 50 per cent of National Societies introduce Forecast-based \\nFinancing and community-based surveillance systems.\\n At least 50 per cent of National Societies engage with Safer Schools initiatives.\\n \\nof fraud and corruption, sexual exploitation and abuse, to maintain the highest standards \\nof integrity, probity, transparency and accountability to our communities and partners.\\n \\nrepresentatives, elected or appointed by youth, at a decision-making level.\\nScaling up the individual and collective impact of National \\nSocieties to build resilience, provide humanitarian assistance \\nand social care at regional, national and local levels.\\nRESULT: \\nMANILA DECLARATION\\n\\nIn August 2018, more than 700,000 people displaced by violence \\nin Myanmar™s Rakhine State, the largest population movement \\ncrisis in the Asia Paci˜c region in decades, are living in camps in \\nCox™s Bazar. \\nThis equates to a population density of more than 60,000 \\npeople per square kilometreŠone and a half times that of Manila, the most \\ndensely populated city on earth. \\nThe Bangladesh Red Crescent Society \\nspearheaded the response, being present in more than half of the \\n34 camps in Cox™s Bazar.\\nThroughout 2018, the IFRC coordinated with government author\\n-ities on Population Movement Operations and provided support \\nto the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society response, including with \\nthe deployment of an Emergency Hospital and three Emergency \\nClinics, strategic and operational technical support, the facilitation \\nof workshops and dialogue on priority issues of concern, such as the \\nrepatriation of displaced people to Myanmar and their relocation to \\nan offshore island in Bangladesh.\\nThe IFRC facilitated the participation of the Bangladesh Red \\nCrescent in the UN High-level roundtable convened by the UN \\nEnvoy for Youth in Cox™s Bazar to discuss strategies for strength\\n-ening collective efforts to address the needs and rights of children, \\nadolescents, and young adults of both host and guest communities.\\nThe support also included the deployment of regular surge and \\npartner National Society support missions (Australian Red Cross \\nand Canadian Red Cross) to improve contextual analysis and com\\n-munication, surge support from the IFRC migration team, and the \\ndeployment of a British Red Cross Anti-Traf˜cking Expert.

The political and humanitarian envi\\n-ronment in the region has become more challenging with increasing hostility towards migrants.\\nMore than 1.6 million people have been displaced and more than 4 million people in the eastern \\nDonbas region of Ukraine have been directly affected by the continuing crisis.\\nAn increase in older populations and in inequality has disproportionately adverse health effects \\non the poorest and the most vulnerable people. Many of them, including migrants and displaced \\npeople, have little or no access to essential health services. Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, can\\n-cer, and chronic respiratory diseases are together responsible for two-thirds of premature deaths, \\nwhile mental health disorders are the main cause of disability. Tuberculosis and HIV remain a \\nconcern, particularly in Eastern European and Central Asian countries.\\nThe region is also prone to ˚oods, landslides, extreme weather conditions, and occasional earth\\n-quakes. Persistent poverty in some countries such as Moldova, where the national poverty rate \\nis 11.4 per cent, and increasing urbanization have required more diverse strategies to support \\npeople affected by disasters.\\nChallenges to \\nHumanitarian Assistance\\nNational Societies in Europe contend with uneven \\nfinancial and human resources and diminishing \\ndomestic humanitarian space due to competition \\nwith other actors. During the 2018 Almaty Conference, \\nNational Societies identi˜ed the following trends that \\nare impacting their work:\\nŁ New forms of volunteering and self-organizing \\ncommunities beyond the Red Cross and \\nRed Crescent models, particularly among \\nyoung people\\nŁ Increasing distrust in institutions, including the \\nRed Cross and Red Crescent\\nŁ Climate change\\nŁ Changing demographics and in particular, a \\nrapidly ageing population\\nŁ Migration, increasing xenophobia and shrinking \\nhumanitarian spaceŁ Increasing digital challenges including online \\nviolence, cyber warfare, and fake news.\\nEurope\\n\\nPriorities\\nThe IFRC Regional Office for \\nEurope provides operational \\nand technical support to \\n53 National Red Cross and \\nRed Crescent Societies, as \\nwell as technical support to \\nIsrael™s Magen David Adom. \\n\\nIt plays a prominent role in \\ndeveloping the capacities of \\nNational Societies, building \\npartnerships and responding \\nto disasters and crises. The \\noverall approach focuses on \\nclimate-smart, socially inclu\\n-sive, integrated programming, \\nincluding mainstreaming gender \\nand diversity, community engage\\n-ment and accountability, and disaster \\npreparedness. Strong coordination and \\ncollaboration are embedded in the design of \\nall programmes. The Regional Of˜ce also sup\\n-ports National Societies in their role as auxiliaries to \\ngovernment, developing their capacities to deliver direct \\nresponse and support to vulnerable people.\\nThe regional of˜ce also provides direct operational support when requested by a National Society. The majority of \\nmigration-related operations in the Balkans and Italy are implemented directly from the Regional Of˜ce in coor\\n-dination with the Country Cluster of˜ce. The Regional Of˜ce facilitates information exchange through regional \\nmeetings, reporting to donors, the development of new partnerships, and with connections to global initiatives.\\nThe Regional Of˚ce™s priorities are on:\\nŁ health: focusing on healthy lifestyles, active ageing, and health in migration and emergencies\\nŁ disaster and crisis preparedness, response and recovery: including revitalizing surge capacity and \\nstrengthening capacities in cash-based interventions\\nŁ migration: including protection, social inclusion, community engagement, and accountability\\nŁ organizational development: including building domestic resource mobilization, and developing branches, \\nleaders, youth, and volunteers\\nŁ partnerships, and\\nŁ communications.\\nAlmaty Commitments\\nThe \\n\\n in Almaty hosted by the Kazakhstan \\nRed Crescent, with the support \\n\\ntogether National Society leaders \\nfrom the region and charted the \\nresponse to humanitarian challenges \\nsuch as migration, social inclusion, \\nageing, youth, and volunteering.

It \\nhighlights the importance of long-\\nterm considerations of migration \\nand calls for increased investment \\n\\nand energy in volunteering, youth \\nsupport, and innovation.\\nEmergency Response\\nIn 2018, the IFRC supported National Societies in \\nEurope with the coordination of Emergency Appeals \\nand DREF operations. More than 80,000 people were \\n\\nassisted through 12 DREF operations implemented by \\nIFRC Network in the region and more than CHF 2 mil\\n-lion was allocated to help National Societies provide \\nimmediate assistance in the aftermath of ˚oods, pop\\n-ulation movement, ˜res, and hailstorms.\\nThe IFRC supported around 650,000 people in Europe \\nthrough the implementation of four Emergency \\nAppeals. Support was provided in 2018 for services to \\nrefugees including those through 15 community cen\\n-tres in Turkey where 3.9 million people are registered \\nas refugees. The community centres provide services \\nto migrants and host communities, including support \\nfor psychological needs, health, protection, livelihood \\ndevelopment, and social and cultural integration \\nactivities. In Greece, the IFRC Network implemented \\nCHF 4 million to help 30,000 displaced people during \\n2018 and following deadly wild˜res, support includ\\n-ing cash grants was provided to more than 3,000 \\npeople affected. Appeals and DREFs were also used \\nto respond to the signi˜cant increase in population \\nmovements through Montenegro, and Bosnia and \\nHerzegovina.\\nEurope\\nPopulation \\nMovement in Bosnia \\nand Herzegovina, and \\nMontenegro\\nThe population movement through \\nthe Balkans reached new and severe \\nlevels in Bosnia and Herzegovina \\nand in Montenegro.\\nThe IFRC supported the National \\nRed Cross Societies in Bosnia and \\nHerzegovina and in Montenegro \\nthrough its DREF allocations, ensuring that they are able to step-up their response to migrants \\nand to the host communities. The support In Bosnia and Herzegovina also contributed to stron\\n-\\nUN Refugee Agency. As the situation worsened ahead of freezing winter temperatures, the \\nIFRC launched an Emergency Appeal in support of the National Society for CHF 3.3 million. The \\nappeal supported the National Society to provide essential life-saving assistance, such as the \\n\\n\\n\\naid to migrants outside reception centres, and shared information on the dangers of unexplod\\n-ed ordinances. The IFRC continues to seek resources for the critical work in these countries.\\n\\nOn 25 March 2018, a ˜re broke out in the shopping and entertainment centre Zimnyaya Vishnya in Kemerovo, \\nRussia, killing 64 people including 41 children, and seriously injuring 79 people. The tragic event exposed gaps \\nin the availability of psychosocial and professional mental health services in the aftermath of such events. The \\nIFRC supported the Russian Red Cross to set up a system of psychosocial help which was coordinated with men\\n-tal health institutes and a referral mechanism was created. The DREF allowed for the recruitment, training, and \\nsupervision of a highly skilled team. According to an assessment, 95 per cent of people who were affected by the \\ntragedy retained their social contacts thanks to the Psychosocial Support (PSS) of the Russian Red Cross and \\nthe IFRC, and 42 per cent underlined the importance and vital necessity of PSS workers. Among the top three \\nmost important factors 18 per cent mentioned the rehabilitating power of the self-support groups that were \\nestablished and coordinated by PSS workers; 13 per cent of people valued the moral support that they receive. \\nThe PSS model was continued with Russian Red Cross funding after the DREF ended.\\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \\n Annual Report 2018\\nStrengthening National Societies \\nIn Central and South-Eastern Europe, the regional \\nof˜ce supported National Societies with their stra\\n-tegic planning processes, capacity development, and \\nhigh-level cooperation agreements with the govern\\n-ment, revision of Red Cross Law and National Society \\nstatutes. The first regional Movement Induction \\nCourse was organized jointly by the ICRC and the IFRC \\nin Budapest, at which 19 leaders from 16 National \\nSocieties enhanced their leadership skills.\\nEffective disaster management \\nThe IFRC helped strengthen the disaster manage\\n-ment capacity of the Azerbaijan Red Crescent in the \\nNakhchivan Autonomous Republic, an area of earth\\n-quakes and border tensions, with the development of \\nan Emergency Mobile Volunteer Team, a warehouse \\nsystem and pre-stocked supplies. It also helped the \\nUkrainian Red Cross to build structures for liveli\\n-hoods and psychosocial support so they can absorb \\nmore funding from multiple donors and to deliver \\nmore services nationwide. \\nThere were nine deployments of the Regional \\nDisaster Response Team (RDRT) which provided \\nimmediate assistance in 2018 within Europe (Russia, \\nArmenia, Belarus, Tajikistan) and beyond (Lao People \\nDemocratic Republic, Indonesia, Mongolia) through \\nseven missions. In 2018, the Regional Of˜ce secured \\nfunding to revitalise the RDRT including modernizing \\nthe training and recruiting new members.\\nIn 2018, the IFRC helped to introduce contingency \\nplans and Standard Operating Procedures for disaster \\nmanagement to the Hellenic Red Cross and to estab\\n-lish the ˜rst National Disaster Response Team (NDRT) \\nand Branch Disaster Response Teams (BDRT) as well \\nas health and psychosocial emergency response units. \\nThe IFRC Regional Of˜ce also provided emergency com\\n-munications support for the Hellenic Red Cross during \\nthis period. These new capacities were successfully \\napplied in the response to wild˜res in August 2018.\\n\\nIn 2018, the IFRC signi˜cantly expanded its resource \\nmobilization capacity development work across \\nEurope and Central Asia. Tailored one-to-one support \\nwas provided to the National Societies in Lithuania, \\nRussia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, \\nand Georgia to improve their fundraising skills and \\ncapacities. The IFRC conducted seven market stud\\n-ies, co-drafted or reviewed ˜ve fundraising strategies, \\nco-launched ˜ve new fundraising programmes, and \\nco-developed four new fundraising professionals. The \\nKazakhstan Red Crescent grew its income in 2018 by \\nmore than 50 per cent (CHF 100,000) which allowed \\nit to provide an additional 6,000 families with food \\nand basic goods. The Lithuania Red Cross initiated its \\n˜rst regular giving programme, generating predict\\n-able unearmarked funding every month. A regional \\nskill-share was held by the IFRC Regional Office, \\nengaging the largest ever number of fundraising and \\ncommunications specialists, focusing particularly on \\nthe Russian-speaking region.\\nThe IFRC Regional Of˜ce established new partner\\n-ships with USAID OFDA, UNFPA, the AIDSFONDS \\nFoundation and the World Bank in Russia to \\nstrengthen humanitarian response and ensure diver\\n-si˜ed resources for the region.

The Regional Of˜ce coordinated \\nan EU-funded integration programme with the National \\nSocieties of Bulgaria, Croatia, and Germany, helping \\nasylum-seekers and refugees with language training, case\\n-work, orientation, skills development, cultural and peer events \\nand access to employment. The programme has captured good \\npractices and essential learning which will inform the social \\ninclusion work of other National Societies and organizations. The \\nRegional Of˜ce also participated in a complementary programme in \\nthe UK, Latvia, Ireland, and Italy, led by the British Red Cross, that empow\\n-ers refugees and asylum-seekers to co-create services to meet their own needs.\\nIn Russia and Belarus, the IFRC supported the National Societies to help displaced people ˚eeing the con˚ict in \\nUkraine who have not yet received asylum status and people whose status is non-regulated. They are provided \\nwith vouchers that can be exchanged for food and essential items and helped with access to legal and health \\ncare support.\\nIn Greece and Turkey, the IFRC supported the delivery of major programmes for refugees, migrants and asy\\n-lum seekers through cash assistance and through integration and social inclusion activities. In the Republic of \\nNorth Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia and Hungary, the IFRC supported National Societies to provide migrants with \\nfood and relief items, hygiene parcels, ˜rst aid, psychological support, as well as awareness-raising activities on \\nhuman traf˜cking, promotion of humanitarian values, social inclusion and integration.\\nIFRC Health Support \\nin Turkey\\nThe IFRC delivered Community-Based \\nHealth and First Aid training for 41 \\nwomen volunteers from community \\nand child protection centres.

It is the IFRC™s \\nthird line of defence after management and risk management activities. It provides the \\nSecretary General with necessary assurance to discharge his accountability respon\\n-sibilities to the Governing Board and more widely the IFRC™s stakeholders, including \\nimportantly, donors.\\nThe OIAI also supports the IFRC™s Audit and Risk Commission (ARC) to undertake its \\nwork on behalf of the Governing Board, including providing the ARC with secretar\\n-iat support.\\nThe OIAI delivers on its remit through the following activities:\\nŁ Audit\\n delivering risk-based assurance across the IFRC, including \\nacross the IFRC™s international programme footprint\\n co-ordinating donor audit and assurance services\\n fraud assurance work\\n co-ordinating the work of the IFRC™s external auditors, KPMG\\nŁ Investigations\\n providing the IFRC™s fraud and whistleblowing response \\nservice, including counter fraud training\\nANNEX ONE\\nAnnex one\\n advising on the handling of fraud cases\\n handling and overseeing fraud response processes across all concern and allegation types\\n leading on major fraud and corruption investigations\\n the oversight and commissioning of suitable responses, including \\ninvestigations to other categories of concern\\n oversight and procurement of fraud insurance\\n oversight and monitoring of the Safecall service\\n retaining and providing the IFRC™s of˜cial record of fraud caseload and its resolution\\n fraud assurance, prevention and response\\n consultancy support\\n governance support including the Secretariat role for the Audit and Risk Commission for fraud matters\\nŁ Consultancy providing co-ordination and consultancy support to the management team™s risk management process\\n providing independent consultancy support and advice to management colleagues\\nŁ Governance support\\n supporting the work of the Audit and Risk Commission, including \\nacting as its secretariat and governance support\\n supporting the Governing Board in its risk, control, governance and counter fraud work\\n supporting the work of the Donor Advisory Group.\\nOIAI excellence\\nDuring 2018 a new director was appointed to lead the OIAI, Anthony Garnett. He is a quali˜ed UK Chartered \\nAccountant (ICAEW), internal and IT auditor, and came to the IFRC from the UK™s Department for International \\nDevelopment (DFID) where he was head of internal audit and counter fraud.\\nThe OIAI has set out its vision for enhancing its audit work and practice. The OIAI intends to become fully \\nrisk-based in its audit work and continue professionalisation its investigations work. This work commenced in \\n2018 and will continue into 2019.\\nThe OIAI has set out its vision for enhancing its audit work and practice. The OIAI intends to become fully \\nrisk-based in its audit work. The OIAI has also set out a vision for enhancing investigations work and practice. \\nThis is focused on being more ef˜cient and effective at handling a greater allegations and casework load in terms \\nof quantum, scope and complexity, whilst being more transparent to key stakeholders, in particular, donors.\\nIn a vision, set out in June 2018, the key principles for enhancement are:\\nŁ greater focus and prioritisation of the OIAI™s work to enhance value for money\\nŁ more conscious planning and development of human resource, intellectual property, processes and audit \\nmethodology to meet world-class best practice\\nŁ improved utilisation and improvement of technology\\nŁ balancing of co-sourced assurance and internally delivered assurance to enhance value for money\\nŁ increased transparency and engagement with stakeholders, especially donors\\nŁ clari˜cation of role and activities to protect independence, whilst continuing to support management \\ncolleagues as required.\\nThe OIAI last had a formal external quality assurance (EQA) review, a requirement under the International \\nStandards, in July 2014. PWC conducted the review independently and reported that the OIAI ‚generally con\\n-formed™ with the International Standards. This was the highest rating achievable under the nomenclature set \\nout in advisory notes from the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).\\nThe Standards require a review every ˜ve years, making a review due in 2019. Given a new, enhanced, risk-based \\nmethodology will be delivered from 1 January 2019, it would make sense for this review to be undertaken at the \\nend of 2019 and beginning of 2020. This review process will be discussed with the Secretary General and Audit \\nand Risk Commission during 2019.\\nIFRC Control Framework\\nThree lines of defence\\nIFRC™s control environment, and the related assurance over the effectiveness of its design and operation, consists \\nof a complex web and number of assurance providers. The OIAI is one, albeit important, provider of assurance. The \\nOIAI commissions a programme of external audit assurance to supplement its internal audit work programme.\\nThere are, broadly, three sources of assurance (or lines of defenc\\neŠ\\nsee below) to IFRC.\\nŁ First line assuranc\\neŠThis captures assurance from the management team in the operational business.\\nŁ Second line assuranc\\neŠThis is assurance from the second line of defence, so-called ‚risk management™ \\nactivities. Examples include corporate headquarters departments and departments in the administration \\ndepartments.\\nŁ Third line independent assurance provider\\nsŠFinally there are those agencies that provide assurance \\nas part of IFRC™s governance arrangements. These parties are neither overseen, nor commissioned by \\nthe management team, and thus represent ‚independent™ assurance providers. The three key sources of \\nindependent assurance to IFRC are:\\n OIAI-commissioned external audit work\\n OIAI-commissioned investigations work\\n ˜nally, OIAI, providing assurance directly to IFRC™s Secretary General over the adequacy and effectiveness \\nof IFRC™s arrangements for risk management; control; and governance through its internal audit work\\nAnnex one\\nThe OIAI, therefore, represents one element of the third line of defence. Internal audit is de˜ned by the Institute \\nof Internal Audit as:\\nﬁan independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organi\\n-sation™s operations.

Donors, IFRC, and delivery national societ\\n-ies are all part of a single Red Cross/Red Crescent federal organisation and add to the framework.\\nThis Federal control framework utilises each ‚red™ organisational component™s own three lines of defence. This \\nis supplemented by legal oversight through contracts, ˚owing from the back donor through to the ultimate \\ndelivery national society.\\nThis standard supply chain control framework (as per other international organisations) is supplemented by a \\nnumber of signi˜cant additional elements of the control framework unique to the Red Cross/Red Crescent:\\nŁ Unique aid modalities from the IFRC to delivery national societies. At present two modalities exist between \\nIFRC and delivery national societies, via cash transfers and working advances. These provide ˜nancial and \\nprobity oversight through audit work to discharge the aid modalities™ oversight requirements. This work \\nis commissioned and overseen by OIAI. The choice of aid modality is driven by a detailed due diligence or \\nassessment.Ł Tied partner choice\\nŠThe IFRC is bound to work only with its members. As such its ‚supplier relationship™ is \\nlong and enduring (currently up to 100 years). The IFRC also has a duty to ensure national society development, \\nworking towards increasing local capacity. This ensures that risk is understood and shared between the \\ndelivery national society and IFRC in an open partnership, whilst maintaining corporate independence and \\nrisk control. This means also that the Federation™s supply chains are short with delivery undertaken through \\n˜rst tier suppliers, not subcontracted down a long supply chain. This also improves value for money.\\nŁ Governance controls\\nŠIn addition to the controls applicable through contractual-legal and aid modality \\noversight, the Federation has governance controls. As a member of the Federation, funding and delivery \\nnational societies are required to abide by the rules of integrity set for it by the Governing Body of the IFRC \\nand Federation. This sets out a range of standards including integrity and governance standards for each \\nnational society, thus requiring their own three lines of defence to be in place and o perate effectively. Where \\nthose standards are not met, the Governing Board, on behalf of the General Assembly, through the Compliance \\nand Mediation Committee, has the power to sanction inappropriate behaviour by any national society.\\nAnnex one\\nThe diagram below sets out the RC/RC federal control framework:\\nDonor\\nDonor\\nNSDonor\\nNSDonor\\nNSDonor\\nNSDonor\\nNSDonor\\nNSDonor\\nNSDonor\\nNSDonor\\nNSDonor\\nNSDonor\\nDonor\\nDonor\\nDonor\\nDonor\\nDonor\\nGrant contract\\nGrant contract\\nGrant contract\\nGrant contract\\nGrant contract\\nWorking advance\\nCash transfer\\nCash transfer\\nWorking advance\\nWorking advance\\nRISKHIGHLOW\\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and\\nRed Crescent Societies\\nGeneral Assembly / Compliance and Mediation Committee / Governing Board\\nThe Federal integrity standards are captured in the Guidance Document for National Society Statutes and the \\nIntegrity Policy.

Given the risks IFRC faces in working in challenging environments, fraud is an \\never-present risk. The ˜rst of a regular quarterly ‚strategic dialogue™ with the IFRC™s key stakeholders concern\\n-ing fraud and misconduct matters was undertaken during 2018. Fraud is the leading number of cases reported: \\n106 opened allegations. Various forms of misconduct (including bullying, harassment or SEA) accounts for 42 \\nallegations, but IFRC has observed an increased number of such reports.\\nThe trend on allegations and investigations undertaken is upwards. This aligns to the IFRC™s approach to \\nenhance staff and stakeholders™ awareness and con˜dence to raise issues of concern with OIAI, and to respond \\nseriously and with a zero tolerance of fraud and misconduct.\\nDuring 2018 the OIAI enhanced its investigations capacity and capability. Systems for triage and referral of \\ncases were codi˜ed. A digital forensic laboratory was introduced in-house for a ‚digital by default™ approach. \\nSpecialised training for the handling of sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) cases was undertaken. A number of \\ncomplex cases were handled using in-house, co-sourced and outsourced approaches.\\n\\n\\nThe OIAI forms an annual assurance opinion to support the Secretary General and regular governance oversight \\nand approvals.

The IFRC has \\nsince tested new payment methods, such as mobile money or prepaid cards, in different emergency operations \\nto secure the payment process to the volunteers, improve transparency and accountability.\\nMadeleine\\nThe OIAI was alerted by a member of the IFRC that the leaders of a National Society could be embezzling funds \\nfrom programs. The administrative investigation found evidence of cheque tampering and embezzlement. The \\ncountry anti-corruption of˜ce is actively investigating the case. Several employees and managers of the National \\nSociety are under criminal investigation. The IFRC, with the support of its governance, has enforced changes \\nin the National Society leadership, organised new elections of the National Society Board and recommended \\nreforms to restore the National Society accountability and transparency.\\nCodie\\nThe OIAI received allegations of abuse by medical doctors in a ˜eld hospital. The OIAI commissioned a spe\\n-cialised investigator and a medical forensic expert to investigate the allegations. The investigation found the \\nallegations were not substantiated, however, it identi˜ed areas for improvement (e.g. medical oversight and gov\\n-ernance, whistleblowing and hotline awareness, incident management, and medical consent and records). The \\nIFRC has formed a working group to draft and publish new standard operating procedures for its ˜eld hospital \\nin order to address the ˜ndings and improve the medical care and attention provided to the population during \\nemergency operations.\\n'"
