FOREWORD| vii |The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 
puts forward a transformational vision 
recognizing that our world is changing, 
bringing with it new challenges that must be 
overcome if we are to live in a world without 
hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in 
any of its forms. 
The world population has grown steadily, 
with most people now living in urban 
areas. Technology has evolved at a dizzying 
pace, while the economy has become 
increasingly interconnected and globalized. 
Many countries, however, have not witnessed 
sustained growth as part of this new economy. 
The world economy as a whole is not growing 
as much as expected. Conflict and instability 
have increased and become more intractable, 
spurring greater population displacement. 
Climate change and increasing climate 
variability and extremes are affecting 
agricultural productivity, food production 
and natural resources, with impacts on food 
systems and rural livelihoods, including a 
decline in the number of farmers. All of this 
has led to major shifts in the way in which 
food is produced, distributed and consumed 
worldwide Œ and to new food security, 
nutrition and health challenges.
This is the third year that we have jointly 
produced 
The State of Food Security and Nutrition 
in the World
. It reaffirms our commitment to 
working together to overcome these emerging 
challenges and free the world from hunger, 
food insecurity and malnutrition. 
Recent editions of the report showed that the 
decline in hunger the world had enjoyed for 
over a decade was at an end, and that hunger 
was again on the rise. This year, the report 
shows that the global level of the prevalence 
of undernourishment has stabilized; however, 
the absolute number of undernourished people 
continues to increase, albeit slowly.
More than 820˜million people in the world are 
still hungry today, underscoring the immense 
challenge of achieving the Zero Hunger 
target by 2030. Hunger is rising in almost all 
subregions of Africa and, to a lesser extent, in 
Latin America and Western Asia. We welcome 
the great progress seen in Southern Asia 
in the last five years, but the prevalence of 
undernourishment in this subregion is still 
the highest in Asia. 
Another disturbing fact is that about 
2˜billion people in the world experience 
moderate or severe food insecurity. The lack 
of regular access to nutritious and sufficient 
food that these people experience puts them 
at greater risk of malnutrition and poor 
health. Although primarily concentrated in 
low- and middle-income countries, moderate 
or severe food insecurity also affects 
8 percent of the population in Northern 
America and Europe. In every continent, 
the prevalence rate is slightly higher among 
women than men.
With regard to nutrition indicators, we are faring 
no better. If current trends continue, 
 FOREWORD
we will meet neither the 2030 SDG Target to 
halve the number of stunted children nor the 
2025 World Health Assembly target to reduce 
the prevalence of low birthweight by 30 percent. 
This year™s report warns that one in seven live 
births (20.5 million babies born globally) was 
characterized by low birthweight in 2015 Œ many 
of these low birthweight babies were born to 
adolescent mothers. The trends of overweight and 
obesity give us additional reason for concern, as 
they continue to rise in all regions, particularly 
among school-age children and adults. The most 
recent data show that obesity is contributing to 
4 million deaths globally and is increasing the 
risk of morbidity for people in all age groups. 
Our actions to tackle these troubling trends 
will have to be bolder, not only in scale but 
also in terms of multisectoral collaboration, 
involving the agriculture, food, health, water 
and sanitation, education, and other relevant 
sectors; and in different policy domains, 
including social protection, development 
planning and economic policy. 
As we seek solutions, we must keep in mind 
the fragile state of the world economy. 
Since the sharp 2008Œ2009 global economic 
downturn, there has been an uneven pace of 
recovery in many countries, and the global 
economic outlook is darkening again. 
This year, importantly, the report notes 
that hunger has been increasing in many 
countries where economic growth is lagging. 
Strikingly, the majority of these countries are 
not low-income countries, but middle-income 
countries and countries that rely heavily on 
international trade of primary commodities. 
Economic shocks are also prolonging and 
worsening the severity of acute food insecurity 
in food crisis contexts. Left unattended, these 
trends may have very unwelcome implications 
for malnutrition in all its forms. Moreover, we 
see that economic slowdowns and downturns 
disproportionally challenge food security and 
nutrition where inequalities in the distribution 
of income and other resources are profound. 
We must recognize the importance of 
safeguarding food security and nutrition in 
times of economic difficulty. We must invest 
wisely during periods of economic booms 
to reduce economic vulnerability and build 
capacity to withstand and quickly recover 
when economic turmoil erupts. We must 
foster pro-poor and inclusive structural 
transformation focusing on people and 
placing communities at the centre to reduce 
economic vulnerabilities and set ourselves on 
track to ending hunger, food insecurity and 
all forms of malnutrition while ﬁleaving no 
one behindﬂ.
FOREWORD
| viii |To make our transformational vision pro-poor 
and inclusive, we must integrate food security 
and nutrition concerns into poverty reduction 
efforts to make the most of the synergies 
between eradicating poverty, hunger, food 
insecurity and malnutrition. We must also 
ensure that reducing gender inequalities and 
social exclusion of population groups is either 
the means to, or the outcome of, improved 
food security and nutrition.
This will require accelerated and aligned actions 
from all stakeholders and countries, including 
tireless and more integrated support from the 
United Nations and the international community 
to countries in support of their development 
priorities, through multilateral agreements and 
means of implementation, so that countries can 
embark on a pro-poor and inclusive path to 
transformation in a people-centred way to free 
the world from poverty, inequalities, hunger, 
food insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms.

| ix || x |METHODOLOGYThe State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2019
 has been prepared by the FAO Agricultural 
Development Economics Division in collaboration with the Statistics Division of the Economic and Social 
Development Department and a team of technical experts from FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO. 
A senior advisory team consisting of designated senior managers of the five UN publishing partners 
guided the production of the report. Led by FAO, this team decided on the outline of the report and 
defined its thematic focus. It further gave oversight to the technical writing team composed of experts 
from each of the five co-publishing agencies. Background technical papers were prepared to support the 
research and data analysis undertaken by the members of the writing team. 
The writing team produced a number of interim outputs, including an annotated outline, first draft 
and final draft of the report. These were reviewed, validated and cleared by the senior advisory team at 
each stage in the preparation process. The final report underwent a rigorous technical review by senior 
management and technical experts from different divisions and departments within each of the five 
UN˜agencies, both at headquarters and decentralized offices. Finally, the report underwent executive 
review and clearance by the heads of agency of the five co-publishing partners.

| xiii |KEY MESSAGES After decades of steady decline, the trend in 
world hunger Œ as measured by the prevalence of 
undernourishment Œ reverted in 2015, remaining 
virtually unchanged in the past three years at a level 
slightly below 11 percent. Meanwhile, the number of 
people who suffer from hunger has slowly increased. 
As a result, more than 820 million people in the 
world were still hungry in 2018, underscoring the 
immense challenge of achieving the Zero Hunger 
target by 2030.
 Hunger is on the rise in almost all African 
subregions, making Africa the region with the highest 
prevalence of undernourishment, at almost 20˜percent. 
Hunger is also slowly rising in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, although its prevalence is still below 
7˜percent. In Asia, Western Asia shows a continuous 
increase since 2010, with more than 12˜percent of its 
population undernourished today. 
 This year™s report introduces a second indicator for 
monitoring SDG Target 2.1: the Prevalence of 
Moderate or Severe Food Insecurity based on the 
Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). While severe 
food insecurity is associated with the concept of 
hunger, people experiencing moderate food insecurity 
face uncertainties about their ability to obtain food, 
and have been forced to compromise on the quality 
and/or quantity of the food they consume.
 Considering all people in the world affected by 
moderate levels of food insecurity together with 
those who suffer from hunger, it is estimated that 
over 2˜billion people do not have regular access to 
safe, nutritious and sufficient food, including 
8˜percent of the population in Northern America 
and Europe. 
 One in seven newborns, or 20.5˜million 
babies globally, suffered from low birthweight in 
2015; no progress has been made in reducing 
low birthweight since 2012. The number of 
children under five years in the world affected by 
stunting, by contrast, has decreased by 10˜percent 
in the past six years. However, with 149˜million 
children still stunted, the pace of progress is too 
slow to meet the 2030 target of halving the 
number of stunted children.
 Overweight and obesity continue to increase 
in all regions, particularly among school-age 
children and adults. In 2018, an estimated 
40˜million children under five were overweight. 
 In 2016, 131˜million children 5Œ9˜years˜old, 
207˜million adolescents and 2˜billion adults were 
overweight. About a third of overweight 
adolescents and adults, and 44 percent of 
overweight children aged 5Œ9 were obese. 
 The economic costs of malnutrition are staggering.
| xiv | Analysis of household and individual level data from 
selected countries across all regions shows that food 
insecurity plays an important role as a determinant of 
many different forms of malnutrition. In upper-middle- 
and high-income countries in particular, living in a 
food-insecure household is a predictor of obesity in 
school-age children, adolescents, and adults. 
 Previous editions of this report show how conflict 
and climate variability and extremes are exacerbating 
the above trends. This year the report shows that the 
uneven pace of economic recovery and continuing 
poor economic performance in many countries after 
the 2008Œ2009 global economic downturn are also 
undermining efforts to end hunger and malnutrition. 
Episodes of financial stress, elevated trade tensions and 
tightening financial conditions are contributing to 
uncertain global economic prospects. 
 Hunger has increased in many countries where the 
economy has slowed down or contracted, mostly in 
middle-income countries. Furthermore, economic shocks 
are contributing to prolonging and worsening the 
severity of food crises caused primarily by conflict and 
climate shocks. 
 Out of 65˜countries where recent adverse impacts of 
economic slowdowns and downturns on food security 
and nutrition have been strongest, 52˜countries rely 
heavily on primary commodity exports and/or imports. 
 Economic slowdowns or downturns 
disproportionally undermine food security and 
nutrition where inequalities are greater. Income 
inequality increases the likelihood of severe food 
insecurity, and this effect is 20 percent higher for 
low-income countries compared with middle-
income countries. Income and wealth inequalities 
are also closely associated with undernutrition, 
while more complex inequality patterns are 
associated with obesity.
 To safeguard food security and nutrition, it is 
critical to already have in place economic and 
social policies to counteract the effects of adverse 
economic cycles when they arrive, while avoiding 
cuts in essential services, such as health care and 
education, at all costs. In the longer term, 
however, this will only be possible through 
fostering pro-poor and inclusive structural 
transformation, particularly in countries that rely 
heavily on trade in primary commodities.
 To ensure that structural transformation is 
pro-poor and inclusive requires integrating food 
security and nutrition concerns into poverty 
reduction efforts, while ensuring that reducing 
gender inequalities and social exclusion of 
population groups is either the means to, or 
outcome of, improved food security and nutrition.
| xv |EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
ADVANCING THE MONITORING OF 
 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN 
 THE ERA OF THE 2030 AGENDA FOR 
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
Two years ago, this annual report was 
transformed to meet the needs of a new era 
in monitoring the progress made towards 
achieving a world without hunger and 
malnutrition in all its forms, within the 
framework of the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs). Specifically, the report began 
in 2017 to monitor progress towards both 
the targets of ending hunger and ensuring 
access to food by all (SDG Target 2.1) and 
of eliminating all forms of malnutrition 
(SDG Target 2.2). Given the broadened scope 
to include a focus on nutrition, the report 
was renamed 
The State of Food Security and 
Nutrition in the World
, and UNICEF and the 
World Health Organization (WHO) joined 
the traditional partnership of FAO, IFAD 
and WFP in preparing it. To provide better 
guidance on how to meet the challenges 
of the changing world, the report was also 
expanded to include an in-depth thematic 
analysis on the underlying factors and drivers 
behind the observed food security and 
nutrition trends, and to link progress towards 
improved food security and nutrition with 
other SDGs.
This report has traditionally tracked world hunger 
using the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU), 
one of the indicators used to monitor global 
progress towards SDG Target 2.1. This year the 
report takes another step forward by reporting, 
for the first time, another indicator of the global 
SDG monitoring framework: the prevalence of 
moderate or severe food insecurity based on the 
Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES). The 2030 
Agenda, by including this indicator, recognizes 
that food insecurity is more than hunger. 
The Zero Hunger goal aims not simply to 
ﬁeradicate hungerﬂ, but also to ﬁensure access by 
all people [–] to safe, nutritious and sufficient 
food all year roundﬂ (SDG Target 2.1) and to 
ﬁeradicate all forms of malnutritionﬂ 
(SDG Target 2.2). Fortunately, data-gathering 
 and measurement tools are rapidly evolving to 
meet the monitoring challenges presented by the 
new agenda and this report now includes this 
new indicator of food insecurity. The report thus 
reflects a more comprehensive approach to 
monitoring progress towards eliminating hunger, 
food insecurity and malnutrition and to 
understanding the interrelationships 
between them. 
AFTER A DECADE OF STEADY DECLINE, 
 THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SUFFERING 
FROM HUNGER IN THE WORLD HAS 
SLOWLY INCREASED FOR SEVERAL 
 YEARS IN A ROW, UNDERSCORING 
 THE IMMENSE CHALLENGE OF ENDING 
HUNGER BY 2030
The two most recent editions of this report 
already offered evidence that the decline 
seen in the prevalence of undernourishment 
in the world over a decade had ended, 
and that hunger was slowly on the rise. 
Evidence available this year confirms that 
the global level of the prevalence of 
undernourishment has remained virtually 
unchanged in the last three years, at a level 
slightly below 11 percent. The absolute number 
of people suffering from hunger, however, 
continues to increase, albeit slowly. More than 
820˜million people in the world are hungry 
today, underscoring the immense challenge of 
achieving the Zero Hunger target by 2030. 
Hunger is on the rise in almost all 
subregions of Africa, where the prevalence 
of undernourishment has reached levels of 
22.8˜percent in sub-Saharan Africa, and to 
| xvi |a lesser extent in Latin America. In Asia, 
despite great progress in the last five years, 
Southern Asia is still the subregion where the 
prevalence of undernourishment is highest, 
at almost 15˜percent, followed by Western 
Asia, at over 12˜percent, where the situation 
is worsening. Looking across regions, the 
undernourished population is distributed 
unevenly, with the majority living in Asia 
(more than 500˜million). The number has 
been increasing steadily in Africa where 
it reached almost 260˜million people in 
2018, with more than 90˜percent living in 
sub-Saharan Africa. 
A broader look at the extent of food 
insecurity, beyond hunger, shows that 
17.2˜percent of the world population, or 
1.3˜billion people, have experienced food 
insecurity at moderate levels. This means that 
they do not have regular access to nutritious 
and sufficient food Œ even if they are not 
necessarily suffering from hunger, they are at 
greater risk of various forms of malnutrition 
and poor health. The combination of 
moderate and severe levels of food insecurity 
brings the estimate to 26.4˜percent of the 
world population, amounting to a total of 
about 2˜billion people. 
In high-income countries, too, sizeable 
portions of the population lack regular access 
to nutritious and sufficient food. Eight percent 
of the population in Northern America and 
Europe is estimated to be food insecure, 
mainly at moderate levels of severity.
A closer examination of the estimates of 
food insecurity (moderate and severe) points 
also to a gender gap. In every continent, 
the prevalence of food insecurity is slightly 
higher among women than men, with the 
largest differences found in Latin America.
CHILDHOOD STUNTING IS DECREASING 
TOO SLOWLY AND ANAEMIA IN WOMEN 
PERSISTS; BUT OVERWEIGHT AND 
OBESITY ARE ACTUALLY RISING IN MOST 
COUNTRIES, CALLING ATTENTION TO THE 
NEED FOR GREATER EFFORTS TO HALT 
AND REVERSE THIS GROWING EPIDEMIC
This year the report takes a closer look at 
data on overweight and obesity, a serious 
public health challenge affecting people of 
all ages. Obesity is on the rise in almost all 
countries, contributing to 4˜million deaths 
globally. The increase in prevalence of 
obesity between 2000 and 2016 has been even 
faster than that of overweight. No region 
is exempt from the epidemic of overweight 
and obesity. The prevalence of overweight is 
increasing in all age groups, with particularly 
steep increases among school-age children 
and adults. Throughout the world, most 
school-age children do not eat enough fruit or 
vegetables, regularly consume fast food and 
carbonated soft drinks, and are not physically 
active on a daily basis. Multifaceted, 
multisectoral approaches are needed to 
halt and reverse the obesity epidemic. 
Policies to protect, promote and support 
breastfeeding and to increase the availability 
and affordability of nutritious foods that 
constitute a healthy diet are required, along 
with measures to create healthier food 
environments and limit consumption of 
harmful fats, salt and sugars. 
It is encouraging to note that the number of 
stunted children has declined by 10˜percent 
over the past six years, but this rate of 
reduction is too slow to achieve the 2030 
target of a 50˜percent reduction in the number 
of stunted children. While the prevalence of 
stunting is decreasing in almost every region, 
the extent of progress varies considerably. 
| xvii |Africa has made the least progress in reducing 
stunting prevalence since 2012. In 2018, 
Africa and Asia accounted for more than nine 
out of ten of all stunted children globally, 
representing 39.5˜percent and 54.9˜percent of 
the global total, respectively. 
In the next ten years, urgent action is needed 
to achieve other global nutrition targets as 
well. Only 40˜percent of infants under six 
months are exclusively breastfed, which is far 
from the 2030 target of 70˜percent. In 2018, 
7.3˜percent of children were wasted, and this 
must be reduced by more than half to reach 
the target of less than 3˜percent by 2030. 
Anaemia currently affects 33˜percent of women 
of reproductive age Œ more than double the 
2030 target of 15˜percent.
Low birthweight estimates are included 
for the first time in this year™s edition of 
the report, following the release of new 
global estimates. They indicate that one 
in seven live births, or 20.5˜million babies 
globally, suffered from low birthweight in 
2015. New evidence this year also shows 
that no progress has been made in reducing 
the prevalence of low birthweight since 
2012. This lack of progress signals that 
it will be difficult to achieve the World 
Health Assembly global goal of a 30˜percent 
reduction in the prevalence of low birthweight 
infants by 2030. This is concerning, as low 
birthweight newborns have a higher risk of 
dying in the first month of life, and those 
who survive are more likely to suffer from 
stunted growth and face increased risk of 
adult-onset chronic conditions including 
obesity and diabetes. 
Beyond the immense human costs of 
malnutrition, the economic costs are 
staggering. It is projected that undernutrition 
will reduce Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
by up to 11˜percent in Africa and Asia, while 
obesity costs USD˜2˜trillion annually, largely 
driven by the value placed on lost economic 
productivity, plus direct healthcare costs 
worldwide. The various forms of malnutrition 
are intertwined throughout the life cycle and 
between generations, with undernutrition in 
foetal and early life contributing to stunted 
physical growth and higher risk of overweight 
and chronic diseases like diabetes later in 
life. The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition, 
based on the ICN2 Framework for Action, 
emphasizes that tackling malnutrition in all 
its forms is not the domain of any one sector 
alone. The health, education, agriculture, 
social protection, planning and economic 
policy sectors all have a role to play, as well as 
legislators and other political leaders.
Moderate levels of food insecurity Œ defined 
as uncertain access to food of sufficient 
quality and/or quantity, but not so extreme 
that it causes insufficient dietary energy 
intake (undernourishment) Œ can increase 
the risk of seemingly divergent forms of 
malnutrition, including overweight and 
obesity. Analysis of household and individual 
level data from selected countries across all 
regions reveals that food insecurity plays an 
important role as a determinant of different 
forms of malnutrition in all countries studied. 
In upper-middle- and high-income countries, 
living in a food-insecure household is a 
predictor of obesity in school-age children, 
adolescents and adults. Factors that help to 
explain the link between food insecurity and 
overweight and obesity include the higher 
cost of nutritious foods (and their substitution 
with cheaper foods that are high in fats and 
sugar), the stress of living with uncertain 
access to food, and physiological adaptations 
to food restrictions. 
| xviii |ECONOMIC SLOWDOWNS AND 
DOWNTURNS POSE CHALLENGES FOR 
FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION; 
CREATING SUSTAINED ESCAPES REQUIRES 
SAFEGUARDING AGAINST THESE AND 
TACKLING INCREASING INEQUALITIES
Previous editions of this report identified that 
conflict, climate variability and extremes, and 
economic slowdowns were behind the recent 
rise in hunger. The previous two editions 
respectively provided an in-depth analysis 
on the first two drivers. This year the report 
looks closely at the third key driver, economic 
slowdowns, broadening the focus to also 
include economic downturns.
The risk that the unwelcome trends in 
hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition 
described above will continue is particularly 
high today, considering the fragile state and 
worrisome outlook of the world economy. 
The latest global economic prospects warn of 
slowing and stalled economic growth in many 
countries, including emerging and developing 
economies. Most regions rebounded after the 
sharp 2008Œ2009 global economic downturn, 
but the recovery has been uneven and short 
lived, as many countries have experienced 
generally declining trends in economic 
growth since 2011. Episodes of financial 
stress, elevated trade tensions and tightening 
financial conditions are clouding global 
economic prospects.
New evidence confirms hunger has been 
on the rise for many of the countries where 
the economy slowed down or contracted. 
Most countries (65 out of 77) that experienced 
a rise in undernourishment between 
2011 and 2017 simultaneously suffered 
an economic slowdown or downturn. 
Strikingly, the majority of these cases 
involved not low-income countries, but 
middle-income countries. Economic shocks 
have also prolonged and worsened the impact 
of conflict and climate events on acute food 
insecurity requiring urgent humanitarian 
assistance in food crisis countries. In more 
than half of the countries affected by food 
crises in 2018, the compounding impact 
of multiple economic shocks worsened the 
severity of acute food insecurity, affecting 
96 million people. 
Marked declines in primary commodity prices 
have contributed to economic slowdowns 
and downturns during the 2011Œ2017 period, 
mainly affecting countries highly dependent 
on primary commodity exports and/or 
imports. Most countries (52 out of 65) that saw 
undernourishment rise during recent economic 
slowdowns and downturns are countries 
whose economies are highly dependent on 
primary commodities for export and/or imports. 
In 2018, most of the countries (81 percent) 
where economic shocks worsened the 
severity of the food crises were high primary 
commodity-dependent countries. 
Economic events generally affect food security 
and nutrition, depending on the extreme 
poverty level, but also on the existence of 
inequalities in income distribution as well as 
in access to basic services and assets, many 
of which result from social exclusion and the 
marginalization of groups. Where inequality is 
greater, economic slowdowns and downturns 
have a disproportionate effect on food 
 security and nutrition for lower-income 
populations. Inequality increases the 
likelihood of severe food insecurity and this 
effect is 20˜percent higher for low-income 
countries compared with middle-income 
countries. Income and wealth inequalities are 
also closely associated with undernutrition, 
while more complex inequality patterns are 
associated with obesity.
| xix |This report calls for action on two fronts: 
the first, safeguarding food security and 
nutrition through economic and social 
policies that help counteract the effects of 
economic slowdowns or downturns, including 
guaranteeing funding of social safety nets 
and ensuring universal access to health 
and education; and, the second, tackling 
existing inequalities at all levels through 
multisectoral policies that make it possible to 
more sustainably escape from food insecurity 
and malnutrition. Acting on these two 
fronts requires short- and long-term policy 
responses that will depend on institutional 
capacity and availability of contingency 
mechanisms and funds to support them. 
The latter, in turn, requires strengthening 
the savings capacity of the economy when 
it is growing, so as to make countercyclical 
policies feasible when the need arises. 
In the short term, countries need to protect 
incomes and purchasing power, particularly 
for the most affected households, through 
social protection programmes, including cash 
transfers and school feeding; public works 
programmes that help reduce unemployment; 
health sector policies that protect the poor 
against catastrophic out-of-pocket healthcare 
costs; and, if needed, policies aimed at reducing 
excessive volatility of food prices. In the 
longer term, countries need to invest wisely 
during periods of economic booms to reduce 
economic vulnerabilities and inequalities; 
build capacity to withstand shocks; maintain 
health and other social expenditures; use policy 
tools to create healthier food environments; 
and quickly recover when economic turmoil 
erupts. This requires balancing a set of policies 
and investments to achieve a structural 
transformation that also fosters poverty 
reduction and more egalitarian societies. 
It is imperative, in particular, that countries 
with economies that are highly dependent on 
primary commodities foster such inclusive 
structural transformation to reduce their 
economic vulnerability.
This structural transformation, involving 
agriculture and food systems, must help ensure 
that food security and nutrition objectives are 
met. This will depend on the type of commodities 
and the quality of food that is generated under 
this process, and will require fostering better 
access to more nutritious foods that constitute 
a healthy diet to all. Policymakers must also 
ensure that policies that facilitate trade also help 
achieve nutrition objectives. Integrating food 
security and nutrition concerns into poverty 
reduction efforts, while increasing synergies 
between poverty reduction, hunger and 
malnutrition eradication must also be part of the 
transformation. Furthermore, reducing gender 
inequalities and those inequalities arising from 
social discrimination and exclusion of population 
groups needs to be either the means to improving 
food security and nutrition, or the outcome of 
doing so.
The trends, findings and policy 
recommendations briefly presented in this 
executive summary are discussed in much 
greater detail in the two parts of this report. 
Part 1 presents the most recent trends in 
hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all 
its forms with a focus on monitoring progress 
on SDG Targets 2.1 and 2.2. It introduces for 
the first time one of the indicators of the SDG 
monitoring framework for SDG Target 2.1: 
 the prevalence of moderate or severe food 
insecurity based on the Food Insecurity 
Experience Scale (FIES). This year™s report 
also presents for the first time low birthweight 
estimates. The last section of Part 1 presents 
new evidence on the links between moderate 
 or severe food insecurity and the various forms 
 of malnutrition. 
| xx |Part 2 looks closely at the role that economic 
slowdowns and downturns have played in 
recent food security and nutrition trends. 
The analysis ultimately points to guidance 
on what short- and long-term policies are 
necessary to safeguard food security and 
nutrition, either during episodes of economic 
turmoil or in preparation for them. This is 
particularly relevant today given the alarming 
signs in the world economy, so that policy 
considerations are relevant to achieving 
the goals of ending hunger and all forms of 
malnutrition by 2030 (SDG Targets 2.1 and 
2.2) as well as other related SDGs, especially 
Œ though not exclusively Œ eradicating 
extreme poverty (SDG 1), ensuring decent 
work and inclusive economic growth (SDG 8), 
and reducing inequalities (SDG 10).

 FOOD SECURITY 
AND NUTRITION 
AROUND 
 THE WORLD 
 IN 2019
Much has changed since 1974, when FAO first 
began reporting on the extent of hunger in the 
world. The world population has grown steadily, 
with most people now living in urban areas. 
Technology has evolved at a dizzying pace, 
while the economy has become increasingly 
interconnected and globalized. All of this has 
led to major shifts in the way in which food is 
produced, distributed and consumed worldwide. 
But these transformations have also brought 
about worrying developments in malnutrition. 
Although the prevalence of child stunting 
has decreased significantly over the past 20 
years, overweight and obesity, and diet-related 
non-communicable diseases, are rapidly on 
 the rise. 
This vastly different world calls for new ways of 
thinking about hunger and food insecurity and 
their consequences for nutrition. The imperative 
is to make sure no one suffers from hunger. 
But we must also recognize that there are many 
people who, while not ﬁhungryﬂ in the sense that 
they suffer physical discomfort caused by severe 
lack of dietary energy, may still be food insecure. 
They have access to food to meet their energy 
requirements, yet are uncertain that it will last, 
and may be forced to reduce the quality and/or 
quantity of the food they eat in order to get by. 
This moderate level of severity of food insecurity 
can contribute to various forms of malnutrition 
and has serious consequences for health and 
well-being. 
The UN member countries recognized the 
importance of going beyond hunger when they 
set universal and ambitious targets for the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development. The ﬁZero 
Hungerﬂ goal aims not simply to ﬁeradicate 
hungerﬂ, but also to ﬁensure access by all people 
[–] to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year 
roundﬂ (SDG Target 2.1) and to ﬁeradicate all 
forms of malnutritionﬂ (SDG Target 2.2). For this 
reason, this report was renamed 
The State of 
Food Security and Nutrition in the World
 in 2017. 
Since then it has reported on nutrition indicators, 
in addition to food security indicators.
Part 1 of this year™s report aims to bring new 
ways of thinking to bear on the latest trends 
in hunger, food insecurity, and various forms 
of malnutrition. Section 1.1 presents global, 
regional and subregional figures of hunger and 
introduces a new indicator of food insecurity that 
goes beyond hunger to include moderate levels 
of food insecurity. Section 1.2 presents the latest 
figures for seven nutrition indicators, including 
three SDG 2 indicators of child malnutrition 
(stunting, wasting and overweight), with a 
spotlight on the rapid rise in overweight and 
obesity. The links between food insecurity and 
nutritional outcomes Œ particularly overweight 
and obesity Œ are explored in Section 1.3.

NUTRITION AROUND 
THE WORLD IN 2019

| 2 | 1.1 
 RECENT TRENDS 
 IN HUNGER AND 
 FOOD INSECURITY 
 KEY MESSAGES 
 After decades of steady decline, the trend in 
world hunger Œ as measured by the prevalence of 
undernourishment Œ reverted in 2015, remaining 
virtually unchanged in the past three years at a level 
slightly below 11 percent. Meanwhile, the number of 
people who suffer from hunger has slowly increased. 
As a result, more than 820 million people in the world 
are still hungry today, underscoring the immense 
challenge of achieving the Zero Hunger target by 2030.
 This recent trend is confirmed by estimates of 
severe food insecurity in the world based on the 
 Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), which is 
another way to monitor hunger.
 Hunger is on the rise in almost all subregions 
of Africa, the region with the highest prevalence of 
undernourishment, at almost 20 percent. It is also 
rising slowly in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
although the prevalence there is still below 7 percent. 
In Asia, where undernourishment affects 11 percent 
of the population, Southern Asia saw great progress 
in the last five years but is still the subregion with 
the highest prevalence of undernourishment, at 
almost 15 percent, followed by Western Asia at over 
12 percent, where the situation is worsening.
 Estimates of SDG Indicator 2.1.2, which monitors 
progress towards the target of ensuring access to food 
for all, reveal that a total of about 2 billion people in 
the world experience some level of food insecurity, 
including moderate. People who are moderately food 
insecure may not necessarily suffer from hunger, 
 but they lack regular access to nutritious and sufficient 
food, putting them at greater risk of various forms of 
malnutrition and poor health. 
 This new indicator also reveals that even in 
high-income countries, sizeable portions of the 
population lack regular access to nutritious and 
sufficient food; 8 percent of the population in 
Northern America and Europe is estimated to be 
food insecure, mainly at moderate levels.
 In every continent, the prevalence of food 
insecurity is slightly higher among women than men, 
with the largest differences found in Latin America.
Food insecurity is more than just hungerThe main indicator for monitoring progress on 
the eradication of 
hunger
 in the world reported in 
this report is the 
prevalence of undernourishment
, or PoU (SDG Indicator 2.1.1). Beginning in 2017, 
the prevalence of 
severe
 food insecurity based 
on the 
Food Insecurity Experience Scale
 (FIES) 
was also included in the report as another, 
complementary indicator of hunger using a 
different approach.
This year's report now takes a step forward by 
also reporting, for the first time, estimates of the 
prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity 
based on the FIES (SDG Indicator 2.1.2). 
This indicator provides a perspective on global 
food insecurity relevant for all countries of the 
world: one that looks beyond hunger towards 
the goal of ensuring access to nutritious and 
sufficient food for all (
Box 1
). As estimates of 
SDG Indicator 2.1.2 refer to the total number of 
people suffering from food insecurity, including 
at moderate levels, it should come as no surprise 
that they correspond to a much higher number of 
people than those who suffer from hunger.
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 
2019
| 3 |BOX 1TWO INDICATORS FOR SDG TARGET 2.1 TO MONITOR PROGRESS ON ENDING HUNGER 
AND ENSURING ACCESS TO FOOD FOR ALLThe SDG framework endorsed by member countries 
of the UN Statistical Commission in March 2017 
and adopted by the UN General Assembly on 
6˜July 20171 includes two indicators for monitoring 
SDG Target 2.1: the prevalence of undernourishment Œ 
PoU (SDG Indicator 2.1.1) and prevalence of moderate 
or severe food insecurity based on the Food Insecurity 
Experience Scale Œ FIES (SDG Indicator 2.1.2).SDG Indicator 2.1.1, the prevalence of 
undernourishment (PoU),
 is FAO™s traditional indicator 
used to monitor hunger at the global and regional 
levels. It is computed from aggregated country-level 
data on food available for human consumption 
(compiled annually for most countries in the world in 
FAO™s Food Balance Sheets) and on less frequently 
obtained data on food consumption from surveys, 
available for a growing (but still partial) number of 
countries. For each country, the distribution of average, 
daily dietary energy consumption in the population is 
compared with the distribution of dietary energy needs 
(derived from the composition of the population by 
age, gender and physical activity levels) to produce an 
estimate of the proportion of the population that lacks 
enough dietary energy for a healthy, active life.
SDG Indicator 2.1.2, the prevalence of moderate 
or severe food insecurity in the population (FImod+sev) based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale 
(FIES), was developed by FAO to complement the 
information provided by the PoU and to provide a 
broader perspective on the food access dimension 
of food security.
2 The approach relies on data 
obtained by directly asking people through surveys 
about the occurrence of conditions and behaviours 
that are known to reflect constrained access to 
food. Based on their responses to the FIES Survey 
Module items, the individuals surveyed are assigned 
a probability of being in one of three classes, as 
defined by two globally set thresholds: food secure 
or marginally insecure; moderately food insecure; 
and severely food insecure. The FImod+sev is the 
cumulative probability of being in the two classes 
of moderate and severe food insecurity. A separate 
indicator (FIsev) is computed by considering only the 
severe food insecurity class.

2 The other three dimensions of food security are food availability, utilization and stability
.FOOD SECURITYAdequate access to food in both qualityand quantityMODERATE FOOD INSECURITYPeople experiencing moderate food insecurity face uncertainties about their ability to obtain food, and have been forced to compromise on the qualityand/or quantity of the food they consumeSEVERE FOOD INSECURITYPeople experiencing severe food insecurity have typically run out of food and, at worst, gone a day (or days) without eatingSDG INDICATOR 2.1.2 The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the population based on the FIESPeople experiencing moderate food insecurity face 
uncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have 
been forced to reduce, at times during the year, the 
quality and/or quantity of food they consume due to 
lack of money or other resources. It thus refers to a lack 
of consistent access to food, which diminishes dietary 
quality, disrupts normal eating patterns, and can 
have negative consequences for nutrition, health and 
well-being. People facing severe food insecurity, on the 
other hand, have likely run out of food, experienced 
hunger and, at the most extreme, gone for days without 
eating, putting their health and well-being at grave risk.The figure below illustrates the meaning of food 
security, moderate food insecurity and severe food 
insecurity, with each category shown as a proportion 
of the total population. FIsev can be considered a 
complementary indicator to the PoU in measuring 
the extent of hunger. SDG Indicator 2.1.2 (FI
mod+sev) is 
the proportion of the total population represented by 
those who experience food insecurity at moderate or 
severe levels combined. This indicator is particularly 
relevant for countries where severe food deprivation 
may no longer be of concern, but where sizeable 
pockets of food insecurity still remain. In this sense, it 
is an indicator that is fully aligned with the universality 
principles of the 2030 Agenda.As a measure of access to adequate food, 
Indicator 2.1.2 brings the perspective of the Right to 
Food to the SDG monitoring framework. Countries can 
use the FIES to obtain data-based evidence about the 
distribution and severity of food insecurity to build 
political will and implement policies to effectively 
realize the human right to adequate food, leaving no 
one behind.The full potential of the FIES to generate statistics 
that inform policy is realized when the tool is applied 
in large national population surveys that allow for 
detailed analyses of the food-insecurity situation by 
income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, 
disability, geographic location, or other policy-relevant 
characteristics. This is already the case for a growing 
number of countries.SOURCE:

1 This means 
that today, a little over 820 million people suffer 
from hunger, corresponding to about one in every 
nine people in the world (
Figure 1
, Tables 1
 and 
2). 
This underscores the immense challenge posed 
by achieving the Zero Hunger target by 2030.
The situation is most alarming in Africa, 
 where since 2015 the PoU shows slight but steady 
increases in almost all subregions. It has reached 
levels of 26.5 percent and 30.8 percent in Middle 
and Eastern Africa, respectively, with rapid 
| 6 |growth in recent years, especially in Western 
Africa (
Figure 2
).As highlighted in past editions of this report, 
these trends are mostly driven by a combination 
of factors, including conflicts and extreme 
weather events, currently affecting a number 
of countries in Africa. In conflict-affected 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa
2 for instance, 
the number of undernourished people increased 
by 23.4 million between 2015 and 2018 Œ a 
significantly sharper increase compared with 
countries not exposed to conflicts (
Figure 3
).An even more dramatic, longer-term impact 
on food security seems to be associated with 
exposure to drought. Countries classified as 
drought-sensitive
3 in sub-Saharan Africa have 
seen the prevalence of undernourishment 
increase from 17.4 to 21.8 percent over the 
last six years, while in the same period the 
PoU actually 
dropped
 (from an average of 24.6 
to 23.8 percent) in the other countries of the 
region. The number of undernourished people 
in drought-sensitive countries has increased 
by 45.6 percent since 2012 (
Figure 4
).BOX 2REVISED SERIES OF ESTIMATES OF THE PREVALENCE OF UNDERNOURISHMENT 
 AND PROJECTIONS FOR 2018The PoU series is always revised prior to publication 
of each new edition of The State of Food Security 
and Nutrition in the World
. This is done in order to 
take into account any new information that FAO has 
received since the release of the previous edition. 
As this process usually implies possible backward revisions of the entire series, readers should 
avoid comparing the PoU values across different 
editions of this report and always refer to the most 
current report, including the time series covering 
past years.This year™s main revision involved an update of the 
Food Balance Sheet series used to estimate the average 
Dietary Energy Supply (DES) for the 53 countries with 
the largest number of undernourished people, bringing 
them up to date through 2017. When needed to 
produce PoU estimates for the most recent periods, 
 the DES was projected based on rates of growth in 
the total availability of dietary energy from cereals 
and meats. These rates were deduced from the series 
of commodity balances prepared by FAO™s Trade and 
Markets Division.1An estimate of the coefficient of variation (CV) of 
per capita levels of habitual, daily energy consumption 
in the population was obtained from suitable national 
household surveys and carried forward from the last 
available year. For countries for which there was 
no food consumption survey covering the period 
2014Œ2018, the CV was projected based on indirect 
evidence, including observed changes in the reported 
prevalence of severe food insecurity estimated using 
the FIES. This was done in order to capture possible 
recent changes in the inequality on access to food, 
which would be reflected in FIsev. Minimum dietary energy requirements (MDER) for 
2018 were computed based on the 2018 projected 
population structure from The World Population 
Prospects, 2017 Revision.21 FAO Trade and Markets Division has developed and maintained a Commodity Balance Sheet database (XCBS) that provides up-to-date and elementary information for analysis of the state 
of agricultural commodity markets at global and regional levels, as well as the food situation of all countries in the world. The XCBS contains balance sheet-structured data for the major 
commodities in the following groups: cereals, dairy, meat, oil-bearing crops, sugar, tropical beverages, bananas and citrus since the 1980s. Data from the XCBS are used in a number of 
systems and publications, such as FAO Global Information and Early Warning System, Agricultural Market Information System, 
Food Outlook
 and 
Crop Prospects and Food Situation

B.| 7 |This overall dire picture of undernourishment in
 Africa is consistent with the extent of poverty 
in the region. With a headcount ratio of 
41 percent, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 
56 percent of the world™s extreme poor in 2015, 
according to the World Bank Group.
4 However, 
this is not just a problem of extreme poverty. 
Even resource-rich countries in these regions 
still have high rates of undernourishment 
 (Tables A1.1
 and 
A1.2
 in Annex˜1A), suggesting that 
something more crucial is at play in terms of 
the structure of their food systems, and that 
still much more should be done to improve 
distribution and consumption of food. Some of 
the fundamental determinants of
 undernourishment related to underlying economic 
structures and inequalities are discussed in 
Part˜2 of this report.
In Asia, the PoU has been steadily decreasing 
in most regions, reaching 11.4 percent in 2017. 
The exception is Western Asia, where the PoU 
has increased since 2010 to reach more than 
12 percent of the population (
Figure 5
). This level in 
the region is second only to Southern Asia, which, 
despite great progress in the last five years, is 
still the subregion where undernourishment is 
highest, at almost 15 percent.

Within the Western Asian subregion, the 
difference is striking between countries that 
have been affected by popular uprisings in 
Arab states and other conflicts,
5 and those 
that have not been affected. For those affected 
countries, 
Figure 6
 shows an increase in the PoU 
from the already higher value of 17.8 percent, 
to 27.0 percent, almost doubling the number 
of undernourished between 2010 and 2018. 
The PoU did not change during the same period 
in the other countries in the region.
In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), rates of 
undernourishment have increased in recent years, 
largely as a consequence of the situation in South 
America, where the PoU increased from 4.6 percent 
in 2013 to 5.5 percent in 2017 (
Figure 7
). In fact, 
South America hosts the majority (68 percent) 
of the undernourished in Latin America. 
The increase observed in recent years is due to 
the economic slowdown in several countries, 
particularly the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 
where the PoU increased almost fourfold, from 
6.4 percent in 2012Œ2014 to 21.2 percent in 
2016Œ2018 (
Figure 8
). During the same recession 
period, inflation in the country was reported to 
have reached circa 10 million percent and growth 
in the real GDP worsened, going from negative

6 By contrast, prevalence rates of 
undernourishment in Central America and the 
Caribbean, despite being higher than those in 
South America, have been decreasing in recent 
years. This is consistent with the economic 
growth pattern observed in these subregions, 
where real GDP grew at a rate of about 4 percent 
between 2014 and 2018, with moderate rates 
of inflation consistently below 3 percent in the 
same period.
7 Analysis of the distribution of the 
undernourished population across regions in 
the world shows that the majority (more than 
500 million) live in Asia (
Figure 9
). The number 
has been increasing steadily in Africa, where 
it reached almost 260 million people in 
2018, with more than 90 percent living in 
sub-Saharan Africa. 
Given these figures and the trends observed 
over the last decade, achieving Zero Hunger 
by 2030 appears to be an increasingly 
daunting challenge.

using the FIES survey module in more than 
140 countries, and those collected by national 
institutions in a number of countries in the 
Americas, Africa and Asia using the FIES or 
other similar experience-based food-security 
questionnaires. Results are made comparable 
for all countries by calibrating them against the 
FIES global reference scale (
Box 3
).8Severe food insecurityAccording to the latest estimates, 9.2 percent 
of the world population (or slightly more than 
700 million people) were exposed to severe 
levels of food insecurity in 2018, implying 
reductions in the quantity of food consumed to 
the extent that they have possibly experienced 
hunger (
Tables˜3
 and 
4). Not surprisingly, 
the figure for 2018 and the levels over the 
period between 2014 and 2018, are broadly 
consistent with those of the prevalence 
of undernourishment, confirming the 
complementarity between the two indicators 
in monitoring the extent of severe food 
deprivation, or ﬁhungerﬂ.
However, there is a slight difference in trends over 
the five-year period, with FI
sev
 increasing slowly 
and the PoU remaining unchanged. This can be 
explained by the fact that while the PoU estimates

  »| 15 |BOX 3COMPUTING FIES-BASED ESTIMATES SO THAT THEY ARE GLOBALLY COMPARABLE
Experience-based food security measurement scales 
have been in use for many years in a number 
of countries, mainly in the Americas. To create 
categories for different levels of food insecurity, each 
country has chosen its own national thresholds, as 
well as its own naming systems. For example, in the 
United States of America households are classified as 
having ﬁhighﬂ, ﬁmarginalﬂ, ﬁlowﬂ or ﬁvery low food 
securityﬂ; while in Brazil or in Mexico they use the 
terms ﬁmildﬂ, ﬁmoderateﬂ or ﬁsevereﬂ food insecurity. 
However, although the labels used are similar, the 
resulting classes are not directly comparable across 
different countries.With the objective of ensuring truly comparable 
classifications, FAO launched the Voices of the 
Hungry Project in 2012. As described below, it was 
necessary to establish a global reference scale on 
which the thresholds for classification into severe 
and moderate food insecurity could be set, and to 
develop procedures to calibrate scores obtained in 
different countries against this global standard.1The eight items (questions) that compose the FIES 
survey module are chosen to represent a range of 
experiences, common to many cultures, that cover a 
broad range of severity on the underlying scale of 
food insecurity, from mild to severe. However, the

imposed a priori, and may vary across countries. 
The statistical measurement model used to analyse the 
data (Rasch model)2 allows for the identification of the 
relative position of the various items along a severity 
scale, based on patterns of responses to the eight 
items, with the basic idea being that the more severe 
an experience is, the less likely respondents are to 
report it. Each country thus obtains its own scale but 
they are not directly comparable across countries.To establish the global FIES reference scale, 
 FAO followed a process that is similar to what 
has been common in many other applications 
of measurement principles, for example, the 
establishment of the Coordinated Universal Time, 
which is used to regulate clocks and time globally. 
In that case, the average of the time kept by 
over 400 highly precise atomic clocks in over 
50 laboratories worldwide is used to ensure one 
common standard reference time. To establish the 
FIES reference scale, FAO used data collected in 
more than 140˜countries worldwide, from 2014 
through 2016 and followed process (consisting 
mainly of two steps) that led to assigning each 
FIES item a position on what became the standard 
severity scale.

Once the global reference scale has been 
established, the process of calibrating each 
country™s FIES measures against the FIES global 
standard is a relatively simple one and can 
be referred to as an ﬁequatingﬂ procedure. 
Conceptually, converting FIES-based measures 
obtained in a given country at a given moment, 
into measures expressed on the global reference 
scale is like converting temperature readings 
from Fahrenheit to Celsius, or measures of 
length from the Imperial to the metric system. 
It simply requires the identification of ﬁanchorﬂ 
points for which measures in the two scales are

In the FIES methodology, such anchor

be considered common to the national and the 
global scale, once the national scale has been 
appropriately rescaled.It is important to mention that, though unlikely, 
differences in interpretation based on language or 
cultural context could potentially limit the ability to 
accurately produce estimates using the FIES global 
reference scale. Research is ongoing to further refine 
the current methodology and to limit the potential 
risk of inducing a bias when adjusting country 
results to the global reference scale.| 17 |reflect structural factors that influence the

 estimates are more sensitive to short-term 
factors affecting people™s direct experiences 
 in accessing food, as reported in surveys. In 
 addition, the PoU for recent years is computed 
based on inevitably less timely data, particularly 
those from household surveys. Therefore the 
PoU may fail to capture the impact of very recent 
phenomena that might have affected the extent 
of inequality in food consumption. Estimates of

expected that the two series will tend to converge

9Consistent with the findings for the PoU, Africa

2018, up from 18.1 percent in 2014.

The increase is concentrated in Southern 
Asia, where FI
sev
 increased from less than 
11˜percent in 2017 to more than 14 percent in 
2018. This possibly reflects an increase in the 
unemployment rate in India between 2017 and 
2018,
10 and especially in Pakistan, where growth 
is expected to slow down significantly.
11Moderate or severe food insecurityA broader look at the extent of food insecurity 
beyond severe levels and hunger reveals that 
an additional 17.2 percent of the world 
population, or 1.3 billion people, have 
experienced food insecurity at moderate levels. 
This implies that these additional 1.3 billion 
people did not have regular access to nutritious 
and sufficient food, even if they were not 
necessarily suffering from hunger, thus putting 
them at greater risk of various forms of 
malnutrition and poor health than the food 
secure population.
The combination of moderate and severe 
levels of food insecurity brings the estimated 
FI
mod+sev
 (SDG Indicator 2.1.2) to 26.4 percent 
of the world population, amounting to a total 
of about 2 billion people (

 and

much higher in Africa than in any other part of 
the world. Here FI

 affects more than half 
of the population. Latin America is next, with 
a prevalence of food insecurity of more than 
30 percent, followed by Asia at 23 percent and 
Northern America and Europe at 8 percent.
Also revealing are the differences observed 
within regions (
Table 3
). In Asia, total food 
insecurity is much higher for Southern Asia 
(34.3 percent in 2018) than for Eastern Asia (less 
than 10 percent). In Africa, total food insecurity is 
also higher for the Southern region (53.6 percent 
in 2018) and the Eastern region (62.7 percent) 
compared with Western Africa (47.9 percent). It is 
at its lowest in Northern Africa (29.5 percent), 
where the food-insecurity profile is much more 
similar to that of the Western Asia region than 
that of the other regions in Africa.
The distribution of food-insecure people in the

The introduction of a new indicator to measure 
food insecurity allows for a more nuanced view 
of the state of food insecurity in the world and of 
recent trends.
Figure 13
 shows trends in the number of 
undernourished, food-insecure and extreme 
poor
12 people in the world from 2005 to 2018, 
contrasting them against the growth in the 
world™s population over the same period.
These indicators provide a consistent picture. 
Both extreme poverty and undernourishment 
have been declining from 2005 to 2015, 
though at different rates. The number of 
undernourished and the number of extreme 
poor were very close as of 2015, with both 
of food insecurity experienced at severe levels is 
much smaller. 
Different patterns in food-insecurity severity 
emerge also when countries are grouped by 
income level. 
Figure 
12 shows that, as the level 
of income falls, not only does the prevalence 
of food insecurity increase, but so does the 
proportion of severe food insecurity over the 
total. In 2018, low-income countries, with a total 
population of only 695 million, were home to 
434 million food-insecure individuals (62 percent 
of the total), 190 million of whom (equivalent 
to 27 percent of the total population) were 
severely food insecure. In contrast, high-income 
countries were home to 102 million food-insecure 
individuals (9 percent of the total), of whom 
21 million (barely 2 percent of the total) were 
considered to be severely food insecure.

To put this in context, one can observe in 
Figure 13
 that even with an increase in world population 
from 6.5 to 7.6 billion during 2005Œ2018, the 
number of undernourished has fallen from 
almost 950 million people to about 820 million. 
This is reflected in a reduction of the PoU from 
14.5 percent in 2005 to 10.8 percent in 2018.
The figure also reveals the benefits of using FIES 
data to obtain a more detailed assessment of the 
most recent years. By zooming in on the period 
between 2014 and 2015, one notes the close 
correspondence between the number of severely 
food insecure, extreme poor and undernourished, 
and also the comparable increasing trends 
between the number of undernourished and 
the number of people affected by severe 
food insecurity.

increase in food insecurity since 2014, from 
1.7˜billion to 2.0 billion, has occurred at moderate 
levels (as seen in the sharper increase for total 
food insecurity compared with that of severe food 
insecurity). This increase parallels the troubling 
increase in overweight and obesity covered in 
Section 1.3, which will explore in detail the links 
between food insecurity at moderate or severe 
levels and various forms of malnutrition, with a 
focus on overweight and obesity.
Gender differences in food insecurity
The FIES data collected by FAO in more than 
140 countries over five years at the individual 
(rather than household) level provide a unique 
opportunity to conduct a differential analysis of 
the incidence of food insecurity by gender. 
Figure 14
 presents the prevalence of food 
insecurity estimated separately for men and 
women worldwide and in all continents (except 
Oceania). It reveals that in every continent,

higher in women than in men, with the 
largest differences found in Latin America. 
Differences are statistically significant, as they 
extend beyond the margins of error represented 
with small vertical bars in the figure.
A more extensive analysis conducted by pooling 
all data collected by FAO in 145 countries in 2014, 
2015, 2016 and 2017, shows that area of residence, 
poverty status and education level are significant 
determinants of the difference in food insecurity 
levels between men and women (see Annex 2 for 
the methodology). Globally, the gender gap in 
food insecurity appears to be larger among the 
less-educated, poorer strata of the population, 
and in urban (large city and suburbs) settings. 
After controlling for area of residence (rural or 
small town versus large city or suburbs), poverty 
status and education level of the respondents,
 the chances of being food insecure are still 
approximately 10 percent higher for women than 
for men. This finding reveals that other Œ possibly 
subtler Œ forms of discrimination make access to 
food more difficult for women, even when they 
have the same income and education levels as 
men and live in similar areas. 
Another study using global FIES data found 
that gender differences in household income, 
educational attainment and social networks 
explain most of the gender gap in food 
insecurity.
13 This suggests that policies that 
address gender inequality in employment 
opportunities and educational attainment may 
also have an impact on food insecurity. Part˜2 
of this report looks more closely at the different 
gender dimensions of inequality that affect food 
security and nutrition, both within communities 
and within households, and outlines the policies 
and approaches needed to address these. 
Global FIES data provide evidence of both causes and consequences of food insecurity at the household and individual levels Studies using the FIES or comparable 
experience-based food-insecurity measures 
comprise a growing body of evidence on causes 
and consequences of food insecurity at the 
household and individual levels. Three studies in 
particular Œ one using FIES data collected by FAO 
through the Gallup® World Poll in the global 
sample of nearly 140 countries,
14 and two others 
focusing specifically on sub-Saharan Africa
15 and 
Arab countries
16 Œ concluded that the likelihood 
of being food insecure was higher for people 
who were unemployed and had low levels of 
education and household income, corroborating 
the results of the analysis of country-level 
indicators presented in 
Box 4
. In the first study, it 
was also found that people with low social capital 
and weak social networks were more likely to be 
food insecure. Elsewhere, yet another study using 
the global FIES data found that food insecurity 
was strongly and negatively associated with 
subjective well-being, regardless of household 
income level or social support. This was found 
to be true in countries of all income classes, but 
more so in high-income countries. In fact, food 
insecurity explained poor physical health and 
lower subjective well-being more than other 
indicators of living conditions such as household 
income, shelter and housing, and employment.
17 Food insecurity can affect health and 
well-being in many ways, with potentially 
negative consequences for mental, social 
and physical well-being. Many studies using 
experience-based food-insecurity scales have 
documented negative psychosocial effects 
of food insecurity in women and children.
18 Furthermore, one particular study using the 
global FIES data found that food insecurity 
is associated with poorer mental health and 
specific psychosocial stressors across global 
regions independent of socio-economic status.
19There is also a large body of evidence on the 
links between food insecurity and nutritional 
outcomes (as described in the 2018 report). 
Together with the evidence cited above, this 
growing body of research highlights the value 
of experience-based measures of food insecurity 
like the FIES. It is worth emphasizing, as well, 
that the FIES-based indicators and the PoU are 
not to be confused with indicators used in food 
crisis situations (
Box 5
). 
The next section presents the latest figures 
on progress towards ending all forms of 
malnutrition, with a special focus on overweight 
and obesity. The final section of Part 1 discusses 
new evidence on the relationship between food 
insecurity and various forms of malnutrition. 
| 24 |BOX 4HOW DO ESTIMATES OF FOOD INSECURITY COMPARE TO OTHER IMPORTANT 
INDICATORS OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT?
National prevalence estimates of moderate or severe 
food insecurity (FImod+sev) based on the FIES rank 
countries in ways that are strongly correlated with the 
rankings produced by other key indicators of human 
development (see table below). As one would expect, 
countries with a lower prevalence of food insecurity 
also tend to have lower levels of poverty and income 
inequality and higher labour force participation rates, 
GDP per capita, literacy rates and gender equity. 
Additionally, countries with a lower prevalence of food 
insecurity tend to have higher Human Capital Indices, 
pointing to a strong link between food security and the 
well-being and development of nations.The table also shows that the prevalence of food 
insecurity is higher in countries with higher ratios of 
dependents (people younger than 15 and older than 
64) to the working-age population (age dependency 
ratio) and a larger percentage of the population 
living in rural areas. Prevalence of food insecurity is 
also lower in countries with greater political stability 
and less violence, a theme addressed in depth in the 
2017 edition of this report. 
Countries where health expenditure per capita 
is lower, and where a larger proportion of the 
population lacks access to safely managed water 
and sanitation, also tend to be countries with a 
higher prevalence of food insecurity. Access to these 
health-related public services also has a strong effect 
on two key indicators of the state of a nation™s health 
Œ child mortality and life expectancy Œ with which 
national prevalence of food insecurity are highly 
correlated. Child mortality tends to be higher and life 
expectancy lower in countries with higher rates of 
food insecurity.

| 25 |BOX 5DIFFERENT FOOD SECURITY ASSESSMENTS FOR DIFFERENT OBJECTIVESThe State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World
 and the Global Report on Food Crises
 (GRFC)1 are 
both multi-partnership efforts that provide assessments 
of food security around the world which complement 
each other. However, they have distinct objectives 
and rely on different data and methodologies, so it is 
important to clarify the difference between the numbers 
that these two reports provide.
While the GRFC has a narrow focus on acute food 
insecurity for countries experiencing food crises, the 
scope of this report is much broader: its objective is 
to monitor food insecurity in the entire world, on a 
regular basis. It is obvious, then, that the two reports 
must be informed by different types of data and 
analytic methods.All the indicators used for SDG monitoring and 
reported here are arguably ill suited to reflect the 
most current conditions during emergencies, 
 a reason why current data for some of the countries 
that are experiencing conflicts are not reported in 
this report. However, that is not the purpose of the 
report. The two indicators used here to measure 
hunger (PoU and FIsev), for example, are meant 
to reliably capture long-term trends at global and 
regional levels, while providing the best possible 
assessment of the most recent structural situation at 
country level. For this reason, they should not be 
too conditioned by possibly temporary, short-term 
fluctuations, typical of acute crises, which are the 
main focus of the indicators presented in the GRFC.PoU and FIsev estimate the extent of severe food 
deprivation in a population, seen as a chronic 
condition, and are based on validated, official data 
which are available with some delay due to various 
rounds of cleaning and vetting. 
The GRFC, on the other hand, focuses on 
acute food insecurity and is mainly based on 
analytic approaches such as the Integrated Food 
Security Phase Classification/Cadre Harmonisé
 (IPC/CH). Since timeliness is of the essence in 
crisis situations, rapid estimates are needed of 
how many people are facing crisis conditions or 
worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above), at the worst 
(peak) moment in the year, based on all available 
evidence, including non-official sources. 
In other words, while chronic food insecurity as 
captured by PoU or FIsev is a long-term or persistent 
inability to meet food consumption requirements, 
acute or transitory food insecurity as captured in 
GRFC numbers is a short-term, possibly temporary, 
inability to meet food consumption requirements 
related to sporadic crises, conditions that can be 
highly susceptible to change and can manifest in a 
population within a short time frame, as a result of 
sudden changes or shocks.This is why this report's estimates of the 
number of undernourished people in the world 
at 821.6 million in 2018 must not be directly 
compared with the figure of around 113 million 
people in 53 countries facing crisis conditions or 
worse in 2018, as reported in the 2019 GRFC.
Having clarified that, however, it is worth 
stressing again how the two reports are highly 
complementary. Acute and chronic food 
insecurity are not mutually exclusive phenomena. 
Indeed, repeated shocks and persistent crises can 
provoke upticks in severe food insecurity, eventually 
forcing households into destitution and chronic 
poverty, and potentially leading to starvation. 
While acute food insecurity may require shorter-term 
interventions that address immediate causes, 
interventions tackling root causes may also be 
important to prevent repeated transitory acute food 
insecurity, which may lead to chronic food insecurity. 
Decision makers worldwide can largely benefit from 
the findings of the two reports.

 PROGRESS TOWARDS 
GLOBAL NUTRITION 
TARGETS 
 KEY MESSAGES 
 Low birthweight estimates, included for the first 
time in this year™s edition of the report following the 
release of new global estimates, indicate that one 
in seven live births Œ 20.5 million babies globally 
Œ suffered from low birthweight in 2015. If current 
trends continue, the 2025 World Health Assembly 
target of a 30 percent reduction in the prevalence of 
low birthweight will not be met.
 Globally, the prevalence of stunting among 
children under five years is decreasing. The number 
of stunted children has also declined by 10 percent 
over the past six years, but with 149 million children 
still stunted, progress needs to be accelerated to 
achieve the 2030 target of halving the number of 
stunted children. 
 A closer look at the SDG indicators of wasting, 
stunting, and childhood overweight reveal striking 
regional differences. In 2018, Africa and Asia 
bear the greatest share of all forms of malnutrition, 
accounting for more than nine out of ten of all 
stunted children, over nine out of ten of all wasted 
children, and nearly three-quarters of all overweight 
children worldwide.
 Malnutrition is linked across the life cycle, with 
undernutrition in foetal and early life contributing to 
both immediate and long-term health problems such 
as stunted physical growth, coronary heart disease, 
stroke, diabetes, and abdominal obesity, as well as 
economic costs due to loss of human capital.
 Globally, the prevalence of overweight is 
increasing in all age groups, with particularly steep 
increases among school-age children and adults. 
The increase in prevalence of obesity between 
2000 and 2016 has been even faster than that 
of overweight.
 Both overweight and obesity are significant health 
problems, but obesity in particular is linked to higher 
mortality and morbidity risks. 
 Throughout the world, most school-age children 
do not eat enough fruit or vegetables, regularly 
consume fast food and carbonated soft drinks, and 
are not physically active on a daily basis.
 Tackling all forms of malnutrition will require 
bold multisectoral action, involving the health, 
food, education, social protection, planning and 
economic policy sectors. Food environments must be 
transformed to make nutritious foods more available 
and affordable. Relevant actions that countries can 
implement as outlined in the ICN2 Framework for 
Action are encouraged under the UN Decade of 
Action on Nutrition.
This section assesses global and regional trends 
and patterns to track progress towards seven 
nutrition indicators used to monitor global 
World Health Assembly targets for nutrition. 
This year the report takes a closer look at data on 
overweight and obesity, a serious public health 
challenge affecting people of all ages. For the 
first time, data on overweight and obesity among 
school-age children and adolescents are included 
and the section highlights some of the dietary 
and physical activity behaviours that contribute 
to overweight and obesity in this age group. 
The trends described emphasize the urgent 
need for actions aimed at improving access to 
nutritious and sufficient food for all.
Malnutrition exists in multiple forms. 
Maternal and child undernutrition contributes 
to 45 percent of deaths in children under five.
20 Overweight and obesity are on the rise in almost 
all countries, contributing to 4 million deaths 
globally.
21 The economic costs of malnutrition 
are staggering Œ obesity is projected to cost 
USD 2 trillion annually, largely driven by the 
value placed on lost economic productivity plus 
direct health care costs worldwide,
22 while it is 
projected that  undernutrition will reduce GDP by 
up to 11 percent in Africa and Asia.
23 The various 
forms of malnutrition are intertwined throughout 
the life cycle, with maternal undernutrition, low 
birthweight and child stunting giving rise to 
increased risk of overweight later in life. 
| 27 |Global trends This year, also for the first time, low birthweight 
estimates are included in the report. These indicate 
that one in seven live births, or 20.5 million 
babies globally, suffered from low birthweight 
in 2015.
24 Low birthweight newborns have a 
higher risk of dying in the first 28 days of life; 
those who survive are more likely to suffer from 
stunted growth and lower intelligence quotient 
IQ, and face increased risk of adult-onset chronic 
conditions including obesity and diabetes.
25  Data show that little progress has been made 
since 2012, with an estimated 14.6 percent of 
all babies worldwide born with low birthweight 
in 2015 (
Figure 15
). If current trends continue, the 
goal to achieve a 30 percent reduction in the 
prevalence of low birthweight infants by 2025 
will not be met.
Estimates of exclusive breastfeeding reveal some 
progress at the global level, with 41.6 percent 
of infants under six months being exclusively 
breastfed in 2018 (based on the most recent 
data for each country between 2013 and 2018) 
compared with 37 percent of infants in 2012 
(based on the most recent data for countries 
between 2005 and 2012). 
Globally, the prevalence of stunting among 
children under five years is decreasing, with 
21.9 percent affected in 2018. The number 
of stunted children has also decreased from 
165.8 million in 2012 to 148.9˜million in 2018. 
Although this represents a 10.1 percent decline 
over this six-year period, it falls short of the 
20 percent decline required over the same period 
to be on track for the 2030 target of reducing the 
number of children by one-half with reference to 
the 2012 baseline.
Globally, 7.3 percent (49.5 million) children 
under five years of age are wasted, which falls 
short of the target of reducing and maintaining 
childhood wasting to less than 5 percent for 
2025 and 3 percent for 2030. In 2018, childhood 
overweight affected 40.1 million children 
under five worldwide. The global prevalence 
of overweight among children under five has 
not improved, increasing from 5.5 percent in 
2012 (the baseline year of the WHA targets) to 
5.9 percent in 2018. 
As of 2016, one in three (32.8 percent) women 
of reproductive age (15Œ49 years) across the 
globe was still affected by anaemia. Since 2012, 
the global prevalence of anaemia has remained 
unchanged, making it extremely challenging to 
achieve the 2025 target of a 50 percent reduction. 
At the same time, adult obesity continues to rise, 
from 11.7 percent in 2012 to 13.2 percent in 2016. 
As a result, we are not on track to meet the global 
target to halt the rise in adult obesity.
Regional patterns Global estimates of various nutrition indicators 
do not reveal the wide variations that exist 
between regions. For instance, in 2015, an 
estimated 14.6 percent of babies born globally 
were low birthweight, with wide variations across 
regions Œ from 7.0 percent in Northern America 
and Europe to 17.3 percent in Asia.
26A closer look at the SDG indicators of wasting, 
stunting, and childhood overweight reveals 
striking regional differences as well (
Figure 16
). 
While the prevalence of stunting is decreasing 
in almost every region, the extent of progress 
varies considerably, with Africa seeing the 
least progress in reducing stunting prevalence 
since 2012. In 2018, Africa and Asia accounted 
for more than nine out of ten of all stunted 
children globally, representing 39.5 percent and 
54.9 percent respectively (bottom of 
Figure 16
). 
No clear conclusions can be made for Oceania, 
as the confidence limits around the estimates are 
very wide for this region. 
In 2018, 49.5 million children under five were 
affected by acute malnutrition or wasting. 
All regions had prevalence levels considered 
ﬁmediumﬂ (between 5 and 9 percent) for 
childhood wasting except Latin America and 
the Caribbean, which had a very low prevalence 
(1.3 percent). In Asia and Oceania, nearly one in 
ten (9.4 percent) children were wasted. Overall in 
2018, more than two-thirds of all wasted children 
under five lived in Asia.
Globally, overweight affected 40.1 million 
children under five years of age in 2018. 
While Asia and Africa had the lowest overweight 
prevalence (5.2 percent and 4.9 percent 
respectively), together they accounted for

and 23.8 percent in Africa). Oceania has the 
highest prevalence of overweight, with almost 
one in ten (9.1 percent) affected. This region is an 
example of a population affected by the multiple 
burden of malnutrition, with prevalence of both 
acute malnutrition (wasting) and overweight 
approaching the 10 percent cut-off for being 
classified at ﬁhighﬂ levels in 2018. There has 
not been a significant change in prevalence 
or numbers of children under five affected 
by overweight for any region between 2012 
and 2018.
In 2018, Africa and Asia had the highest 
prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding with 
more than two in five infants under six months 
benefiting from this life-saving practice. 
Conversely, however, these two regions have the 
highest prevalence of anaemia among women 
of reproductive age. In 2016, the prevalence 
of anaemia among women of reproductive 
age in Africa and Asia was more than double 
the rate in Northern America and Europe, 
with no region showing a decline in anaemia 
among women of reproductive age since 2012. 
(Regional patterns for adult overweight are 
discussed in the next section).
Spotlight on overweight and obesity 
Overweight and obesity pose health problems 
throughout the life cycle. Among adults, obese 
people have higher rates of mortality due to an 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer 
and diabetes. Children who are overweight are 
at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood 
pressure, asthma and other respiratory problems, 
sleep disorders, and liver disease.
27 They may 
also suffer from the psychological effects of low 
self-esteem, depression, and social isolation.
28 Overweight and obesity during childhood 
often persist into adulthood, leading to lifelong 
health problems. The national economic costs, 
resulting from increased healthcare costs and lost 
economic productivity, are tremendous.
29The definitions of overweight and obesity are 
somewhat different depending on the age group, 
making comparisons between them difficult. 
For children under five, overweight is defined 
as weight-for-height greater than 2 standard 
deviations above the WHO growth reference 
standard median. The term ﬁobesityﬂ is generally 
not used for children under five. For school-age 
children and adolescents (aged 5Œ19 years), 
being overweight indicates having a body mass 
index (BMI)-for-age greater than 1 standard 
deviation above the WHO growth reference 
standard median, whereas obesity is defined as 
having a BMI-for-age of more than 2 standard 
deviations above the median. In the case of 
adults, overweight is defined as having a BMI 
greater than or equal to 25; likewise, obesity is 
defined as a BMI greater than or equal to 30. 
For this report, the term overweight is used to be 
inclusive of obesity among school-age children, 
adolescents and adults unless otherwise noted.
At its most basic level, overweight results 
from a persistent condition of dietary energy 
consumption exceeding energy expenditure. 
While genetics can increase an individual™s 
susceptibility to overweight, it cannot 
explain population-level increases over time. 
Intrauterine growth, infant feeding, and 
eating habits during preschool are significant 
determinants of overweight and obesity 
during adulthood. There is increasing evidence 
indicating the importance of good nutrition and 
physical activity in early life as a determinant 
of long-term energy balance. Unfortunately, 
modernization and economic development have 
led to an increased availability of energy-dense 
foods and to poor dietary practices, while at the 
same time reducing levels of physical activity, 
a major determinant of energy expenditure. 
Food security, i.e. access to nutritious and 
sufficient food, is also known to be a key factor. 
Box 
6 provides a more in-depth description of the 
links between maternal nutrition, malnutrition in 
early life and overweight later in life, illustrating 
life-cycle and intergenerational effects.
In 2018, an estimated 5.9 percent (40 million) 
children under five were affected by overweight. 
Globally in 2016, one in five school-age children 
(20.6 percent) and adolescents (17.3 percent) 
were overweight, or 131 million children aged 
5Œ9 years and 207 million adolescents. In the 
same year, nearly two in five adults (38.9 percent) 
were overweight, representing 2 billion adults 
worldwide (
Figure 17
). 
  »| 31 |BOX 6OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY AND THE EFFECT OF MALNUTRITION THROUGHOUT 
 THE LIFE CYCLEAn increased risk for overweight and obesity can be 
imprinted early in life through intergenerational and 
early life influences; such influences have contributed 
to a growing crisis in overweight since 2000, 
as shown in Figure 18. During foetal and early life, 
undernutrition, potentially due to food insecurity, leads 
to changes in physiology and metabolism that not only 
stunt physical growth and negatively impact human 
capital, but also increase the risk of non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs) later in life.1 To illustrate, there is 
ample evidence linking low birthweight to increased 
risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and 
abdominal obesity.
2 The adverse effect of poor foetal 
growth on NCD risk can be amplified by growth 
failure in the first years after birth and rapid weight 
gain later in life.1 Girls who experienced poor foetal 
growth, especially when coupled with poor catch-up 
growth during infancy, are more likely to become 
stunted as adults and consequently more likely to give 
birth to low-birthweight babies, thus projecting 
 poor nutrition alongside increased NCD risk to the 
next generation.3 In addition to the link between early undernutrition 
and subsequent risk of NCDs, another mechanism 
that increases NCD and obesity risk along the life 
cycle is that overweight or excess weight gain during 
pregnancy increases the risk of gestational diabetes 
and large size at birth, which in turn is linked to 
increased risk of overweight and obesity later in life.
4 Irrespective of birthweight, excessive weight gain in 
early childhood is predictive of overweight and obesity 
in adolescence5 and adulthood.6 To effectively address 
the growing problem of overweight and obesity and to 
prevent its perpetuation across generations, it is clear 
that a life-cycle approach is required that promotes 
access to nutritious foods, optimal infant feeding and 
nutrition as well as healthy growth along the entire life 
course, from foetal life to adulthood.PRE-CONCEPTIONPRENATALINFANCY ANDEARLY CHILDHOODINCREASED RISKOF OVERWEIGHTAND OBESITYAN INCREASED RISK OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY CAN BE IMPRINTED EARLY IN LIFETHROUGH INTERGENERATIONAL AND EARLY LIFE INFLUENCESSOURCE:

| 32 |The prevalence of overweight is increasing in 
all age groups, with particularly steep trends 
among school-age children and adults (
Figure 18
). 
Among school-age children, the prevalence has 
nearly doubled since 2000. Over half of adults 
and over a quarter of school-age children in 
Northern America, Oceania, Latin America and 
the Caribbean, and Europe were overweight 
in 2016. 
No region is exempt from this overweight crisis. 
All have experienced an increase of roughly ten 
percentage points in the prevalence of overweight 
among adults since 2000. Among school-age 
children, the upward trend is particularly 
steep in Asia and appears to be accelerating. 
In Northern America, on the other hand, while 
the prevalence of overweight is higher than in 
any other region, the trend shows some sign of 
levelling off in recent years. Among preschool 
children (under five years old), however, the 
prevalence of overweight is much lower and 
trends are less dramatic Œ only in Northern 
America and Oceania has overweight increased 
in this age group by more than a percentage 
point since 2000.
While the rise in the prevalence of overweight 
in children and adults is alarming, of even 
greater concern is the high proportion of

However, this gap has been closing as BMI has 
been increasing more rapidly in rural areas

seen worldwide, but particularly in low- and 
middle-income countries.
30 The problem of 
malnutrition in rural areas is clearly shifting 
from one dominated by undernutrition to a 
significant problem of the multiple burden 
of malnutrition. Among children under five, 
differences in the prevalence of overweight 
by areas of urban or rural residence are 
quite small. Additionally, there is no notable 
difference in the prevalence of overweight by 
sex for any age group.

 and reverse obesity trends Several global initiatives provide roadmaps 
to halt and reverse the obesity epidemic. 
The creation of an environment that enables and 
promotes healthy diets is central to all of these, 
referring to a balanced, diverse and appropriate 
selection of foods eaten over time to ensure that 
the needs for essential nutrients are met, and 
that consumption of harmful fats, salt and sugars 
is limited.
31 Unhealthy diet is now the leading 
risk factor for deaths worldwide. To counter 
this, the Global Action Plan for the Prevention 
and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases 
2013Œ2020 outlines policy options for promoting 
physical activity and healthy diets.
32 Another 
initiative, the WHO Commission on Ending 
Childhood Obesity proposes strategies to end 
childhood obesity that focus on healthy diets, 
physical activity, preconceptional and prenatal 
care, school health, and weight management.
33 It includes actions that are urgently needed 
to address the problems of unhealthy diets 
and inadequate physical activity found to be 
prevalent among school-age children around 
the world (
Box 7
). Finally, the Comprehensive 
Implementation Plan for Maternal, Infant and 
Young Child Nutrition, endorsed by the World 
Health Assembly in 2012, has challenged the 
world to prevent any increase in preschool 
overweight over the next decade.
34 These initiatives highlight the need for a 
multifaceted, multisectoral approach to address 
the burden of overweight and obesity globally. 
In light of this, in 2016, the United Nations 
endorsed the ICN2 Framework for Action
35 and 
declared a Decade of Action on Nutrition.
36 Tackling all forms of malnutrition is not the 
domain of any one sector alone: the health, 
education, agriculture, social protection, 
planning and economic policy sectors all have 
a role to play, as well as legislators and other 
political leaders. A range of actions is needed, 
aimed at the individual, household, community, 
national and even global levels. 
Healthcare systems must provide appropriate 
support, education and counselling for 
individuals and families to promote breastfeeding 
(starting with supportive policies in hospital) 
and prevent and treat overweight and obesity. 
Schools can play an influential role by providing 
environments that shape and enable healthier 
food choices through exposure to nutritious 
foods, combined with nutrition education 
and limiting exposure to foods or beverages 
high in fats, sugars or salt and to marketing 
communication for such foods in or around 
schools. More broadly, transformation of food 
systems is essential in delivering safe, affordable 
and sustainable diets. Social protection 
programmes can also support access to nutritious 
food especially for disadvantaged populations.
Poorer communities often face physical and 
economic barriers to obtaining nutritious foods, 
putting them at higher risk of food insecurity 
and malnutrition. There is growing recognition 
of the need for actions that address factors at the 
community and national levels.
37 Governments 
have a range of policy options to choose from 
to improve access to affordable healthy diets. 
These range from ﬁhardﬂ policies such as 
standards and regulations to ﬁsoftﬂ policies such 
as the provision of information and education. 
Figure 
21
 presents examples of policies and 
programmes being implemented by countries 
and cities with the aim of preventing or reducing 
overweight and obesity. Some of these actions are 
described below. 
Nutritious foods that contribute to a healthy diet 
must be readily available and affordable. In order 
to foster greater physical access to nutritious foods, 
local governments can take several measures, 
such as providing fiscal or non-fiscal incentives 
to increase the number of food outlets that offer 
fresh and nutritious food in neighbourhoods 
and communities
38 (including open-air markets), 
discouraging the sale of fast food near schools 
through zoning,
39 and improving the availability 
of nutritious foods in restaurants through the 
use of non-fiscal incentives such as voluntary 
certification schemes.
40 Nutritious foods have become relatively more 
expensive than foods high in fat, sugar and/
or salt, in high-income countries as well as 
emerging economies such as Brazil, China, 
Mexico and South Africa.

The Global School-Based Student Health Survey 
(GSHS) provides a standard methodology to enable 
countries to collect comparable information on health 
status, risk behaviours and protective factors related 
to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality 
among 13Œ15 year old students.1 The survey includes 
information on a number of risk factors for overweight 
and obesity in school-age children, including low 
intake of fruits and vegetables, eating at fast food 
restaurants, consumption of soft drinks, low physical 
activity, and sedentary behaviour.
2 The data provide 
insights on prevalence and behavioural trends and can 
be used for advocacy, programme planning, targeting 
and evaluation. The data presented here include results 
from 73 countries that have carried out surveys in the 
past ten years.The GSHS asks students to report on their fruit 
and vegetable consumption in the past 30 days. 
Roughly half of the countries reported that between 
10 and 30 percent of students do not eat any fruit 
at all, and a quarter reported that between 10 and 
30 percent of their students do not eat any vegetables 
at all. All but one of the countries found that the 
majority of their students ate less than five or more 
servings of fruit or vegetables per day, and in all but 
15 of these countries over two-thirds of students did 
not eat this recommended amount (see figure below). 
Fruit and vegetable consumption is highest among the 
countries of Oceania.Nearly 70 percent of countries reported that at 
least half of their students eat fast food on a weekly 
basis. Furthermore, 27 countries reported that at 
least two in every ten students eat fast food at least 
three times per week.

whether food insecurity is associated with 
obesity in low- and middle-income countries; 
such foods tend to be widely available in 
upper-middle- and high-income countries, and 
are often cheaper than fresh and nutritious 
foods.
42 To increase economic access to healthy 
diets, effective options are available to local and 
national governments, such as food assistance 
programmes that provide low-income families 
and individuals with supplemental funds to 
purchase fruit and vegetables or promotion 
of healthy food retail development through 
fiscal incentives. Some studies have shown 
that consumption of subsidized fruits and 
vegetables can be increased in the range of 10 to 
30 percent.
43 Policymakers can also use economic 
incentives such as taxes aimed at decreasing 
the demand for foods high in fat, sugar and/
or salt and subsidies to make nutritious foods 
more affordable.
44 Taxes on sugar-sweetened 
beverages in particular have been found to 
reduce purchases and/or consumption of these 
products, not only due to the price increase, but 
also by raising awareness about the resulting 
health benefits.
45 There is some evidence that the 
effects of food taxes are stronger on low-income 
groups because they are more price-responsive, 
and may therefore gain the most health benefits 
Œ especially if taxes are complemented with 
targeted subsidies for more nutritious foods.
46 Furthermore, such taxes can also prompt 
manufacturers to reformulate their products (e.g. 
by reducing sugar content).
47There are a number of other policy tools available 
to national governments to promote healthy 
eating and prevent overweight and obesity. 
These include incentives to encourage fruit and 
vegetable production, regulatory instruments that 
shape nutrition labelling,
48 food standards and 
appropriate procurement rules for schools and 
other public institutions, and national food-based 
dietary guidelines. Provision of free access to safe 
and affordable piped drinking water is crucial to 
promoting health everywhere; easy accessibility 
to safe piped drinking water in schools provides 
a healthy alternative to  the consumption of 
sugar-sweetened beverages. Other important 
policy measures include restrictions on 
marketing of breast-milk substitutes, regulation 
of the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic 
beverages to children, and regulatory standards 
for maximum levels of salt, sugar and fat in 
specific products. Government-led reformulation 
programmes can lead to reductions in the levels 
of salt, sugar and fat across the spectrum of 
processed food and drink products, including the 
elimination of industrially produced trans fats.
49 Importantly, no single measure alone can reverse 
the overweight and obesity trends; rather, there 
must be a multifaceted approach that combines 
different types of policies and interventions. 
This section of the report has documented the 
persistent challenge of undernutrition coupled 
with rising overweight and obesity, known 
as the ﬁmultiple burden of malnutritionﬂ. 
Recognizing that both the drivers and solutions 
to the multiple facets of this burden are 
intricately linked, ﬁdouble-duty actionsﬂ have 
been identified that can address the problems 
of undernutrition and obesity simultaneously.
50 The potential impact for double-duty actions 
emerges from addressing the shared drivers 
underlying different forms of malnutrition, and 
from shared platforms that can be used to address 
them. Many of the policies outlined above are 
examples of such actions. For example, initiatives 
to promote and protect breastfeeding can protect 
against stunting and wasting in childhood, reduce 
the risk of overweight and obesity later in life, 
and regulate maternal weight in the postpartum 
period. School food and nutrition programmes 
can include the provision of meals to children 
who are food insecure while also ensuring 
that they are exposed to nutritious foods. 
Social protection programmes aimed at ensuring 
food security for vulnerable populations can be 
designed in a manner which supports healthy 
eating habits and promotes dietary diversity. 
Double-duty actions thus offer integrated 
solutions that address the shared drivers of 
different forms of malnutrition in many different 
contexts, including the context of humanitarian 
emergencies and protracted crises, where physical 
access to and affordability of nutritious foods 
is often severely compromised. Even in such 
contexts, where the priority is often to treat and 
prevent undernutrition, these actions are needed 
to combat the multiple burden of malnutrition by 
promoting healthy diets (
Box 8
). 
  »  »| 40 |BOX 8DOUBLE-DUTY ACTIONS TO ADDRESS ALL FORMS OF MALNUTRITION IN THE CONTEXT 
OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE
Approximately two billion people live in countries 
affected by fragility, conflict and violence.
1 Although 
humanitarian programmes must focus on saving lives 
and providing food in sufficient quantities to protect 
and promote food security, there is increasing 
recognition of the existence of multiple forms of 
malnutrition in crisis situations that must also be 
addressed.2 The reality of the global distribution of different 
types of malnutrition is complex.2 Wasting and 
stunting occur in both crisis and stable contexts, 
and there is significant overlap in the risk factors for 
and consequences of these forms of malnutrition.
3 Simultaneously, there is growing awareness of the 
shared drivers of obesity and undernutrition,
4 and the 
existence of diet-related non-communicable diseases in 
humanitarian contexts.5 This complexity demands an increase in focus on 
all forms of malnutrition in both humanitarian and 
development contexts. Double-duty actions are needed, 
with a dual focus on meeting immediate needs and 
reducing future risk and vulnerability. In order to design 
context-specific programmes able to respond to the 
multiple burden of malnutrition, programme designers 
and policymakers also need to make better use of 
data, with a focus on certain key questions: Is there 
an enabling environment for good nutrition in a given 
context? Is nutritious food available? Can people afford 
it? Do they choose it? 
Humanitarian actors currently use a variety 
of approaches to protect food security, promote 
good nutrition and ultimately save lives. 
Conditional cash-based assistance, for example, 
can improve access to and affordability of nutritious 
foods, thus enabling vulnerable people, including 
those affected by crises, to improve their diets by 
purchasing food through retail outlets. Both the 
amount of cash relative to people™s needs, and 
people™s choices on how to use it, affect the potential 
impact that this cash can have on nutrition. In many 
contexts, a strong strategy for social and behavioural 
change communication may be required to ensure 
that cash is used to purchase nutritious food and does 
not contribute to an increased risk of overweight 
and obesity.
In Bangladesh for instance, e-vouchers distributed 
to refugees for use in designated food outlets in camps 
allow individuals to improve their diets through the 
purchase of nutritious, fresh foods. E-vouchers provide 
access to 20 different food items, 12 of which are 
mandatory (i.e. e-voucher recipients are required to 
purchase these specific items) while the remaining 
8 can be chosen from other food items that are 
available in the store. This approach helps to ensure 
the quality of the foods purchased while still respecting 
individual choices. Guidelines set for retailers aim 
at selling at least three items of fresh food including 
fruits and vegetables. The financial support provided 
through e-vouchers combined with nutrition education 
and awareness-raising (e.g. on healthy diets and 
cooking methods) is a strong example of a package 
of double-duty interventions that can simultaneously 
address multiple forms of malnutrition.
Although progress has been made in improving 
the affordability and accessibility of high-quality, 
nutritious foods for vulnerable people, challenges 
persist related to supply and demand. Ongoing work 
to strengthen local markets, improve efficiencies 
in the retail sector, reduce the price of food while 
maintaining or increasing profitability, and utilize 
point-of-sale data to understand purchasing patterns, 
are all double-duty actions than can help address 
the growing problem of the multiple burden of 
malnutrition in humanitarian contexts.1 International Development Association (IDA). 2019. Conflict and Fragility. In:

| 41 |In summary, many of the policies discussed 
here aim to increase access to nutritious and 
sufficient food Œ an objective embedded in 
SDG Target 2.1 to ﬁend hunger and ensure 
access by all people, in particular the poor 
and people in vulnerable situations, including 
infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food 
all year roundﬂ. In the section that follows, the 
focus will be on how restricted access to food, 
i.e. food insecurity as measured by the FIES, 
 is linked to different forms of malnutrition. 
 1.3 
 TOWARDS 
 AN INTEGRATED 
UNDERSTANDING OF 
FOOD SECURITY AND 
NUTRITION FOR HEALTH 
AND WELL-BEING KEY MESSAGES 
 Countries with higher prevalence of moderate or 
severe food insecurity based on the FIES tend to have 
higher rates of adult obesity, when controlling for 
national rates of undernourishment and poverty.
 A closer look at household and individual level 
data from selected countries across all regions, reveals 
that food insecurity plays an important role as a 
determinant of different forms of malnutrition. 
 In upper-middle- and high-income countries, living 
in a food-insecure household is a predictor of obesity 
in school-age children, adolescents and adults. 
 In low- and lower-middle-income countries, 
household food insecurity tends to be negatively 
associated with overweight and obesity, or is not 
associated at all.
 Children living in households classified as 
moderately or severely food insecure in a number 
of countries in Latin America and Africa are more 
likely to be stunted compared with those living in 
food-secure households.
To accelerate progress towards ending 
hunger and achieving food security and 
improved nutrition, as required by SDG 2, it 
is important to fully grasp the connections 
between food insecurity and malnutrition, 
and the drivers underlying both. A better 
understanding of these links can lead to more 
effective policies aimed at addressing the 
specific challenges faced by countries and the 
international community. As discussed in the 
preceding section, forms of undernutrition 
such as child stunting and anaemia in women 
are persistent problems in many countries, 
and countries of all income levels are seeing 
a rise in overweight and obesity. The total 
number of obese people in the world (roughly 
822 million, including overweight children 
under five, for whom obesity data are not 
available) surpassed the total number of 
undernourished people (796.5 million, derived 
from the PoU) in 2016.
51Moderate levels of food insecurity Œ defined 
as uncertain access to food of sufficient 
quality and/or quantity, but not so extreme 
that it causes insufficient dietary energy 
consumption (undernourishment) Œ can 
increase the risk of seemingly divergent 
forms of malnutrition. The 2018 edition of the 
report
52 described multiple pathways whereby 
food insecurity may contribute to different 
forms of malnutrition, including overweight 
and obesity. Household food insecurity can 
affect the quantity and quality of dietary 
intake, hence impacting on maternal nutrition, 
child growth and development and potentially 
increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases, 
as well as the risk of anaemia in women. 
Mothers who are food insecure are also 
more stressed and likely to be depressed, 
which can negatively affect breastfeeding 
and care practices. Other factors that help to 
explain the link between food insecurity and 
overweight and obesity include the higher cost 
of nutritious foods (and their substitution with 
cheaper foods that are high in fats and sugar), 
the stress of living with uncertain access to 
food, and physiological adaptations to periodic 
food restrictions. 
This section presents new evidence on the 
links between moderate or severe food 
  »| 42 |insecurity and various forms of malnutrition. 
The analytic approach is two-pronged, but 
conditioned by data availability. First, as 
measures of the prevalence of food insecurity 
and of the various forms of malnutrition in the 
national population exist for many countries, 
the analysis looks at whether the prevalence 
of moderate food insecurity helps to explain 
differences between countries in the prevalence 
of adult obesity, overweight among school-age 
children and adolescents, child stunting and 
wasting, and anaemia in women. Next, there is 
a more in-depth study of the role of household 
food insecurity in predicting malnutrition 
outcomes in individuals using data at the micro 
level from a limited number of countries in 
Africa, Asia and the Americas.
Links between food insecurity and various forms of malnutrition at the country level
The top panel of 
Table 5
 reports the results of 
the Spearman rank correlation coefficient 
between the prevalence of moderate or severe 
food insecurity and that of each of the five 
forms of malnutrition, across all countries 
for which both indicators are available at the 
national level.
53 The correlations between the prevalence 
of moderate or severe food insecurity and 
all nutrition outcomes are statistically 
significant (p-values <˜0.01). The exception 
is child wasting, where significance is only 
marginally below the 10 percent p-value. 
The correlation is negative for adult obesity, 
overweight among both children and 
adolescents, and positive for child stunting 
and anaemia in women of reproductive age 
(Table 5
, top panel).
In other words, it appears that countries with 
a higher prevalence of moderate or severe food 
insecurity (combined) tend to have a lower 
prevalence of child and adolescent overweight 
and adult obesity and a higher prevalence of 
anaemia and child stunting. Such correlations, 
however, could be spurious Œ for example, they 
could be due to a correlation that exists, across 
countries, between the prevalence of moderate 
or severe food insecurity and other aspects, 
such as the incidence of poverty. To explore 
whether the detected link exists because 
moderate or severe food insecurity is relevant 
per se
, and not simply a reflection of other 
structural indicators, a cross-country regression 
analysis was conducted for each of the nutrition 
outcome indicators, against the prevalence of 
moderate or severe food insecurity, introducing 
national measures of undernourishment (as a 
proxy for severe food insecurity) and extreme 
poverty as controls.
54
The results (
Table 5
, bottom panel) show that 
when controls are included, the correlation 
with moderate or severe food insecurity 
remains significant only for adult obesity Œ 
but in reverse direction Œ and for anaemia 
in women. 
The reversal of the sign of the association 
between moderate or severe food insecurity 
and adult obesity, which becomes positive, 
means that moderate food insecurity can indeed 
contribute to obesity, in certain conditions. 
If one focuses attention on countries of similar 
levels of undernourishment and poverty, obesity 
rates are higher in those where moderate food 
insecurity is also higher. This result is in line 
with the preliminary findings described in the 
2017 report which showed how national rates of 
food insecurity were positively associated with 
adult obesity in high- and upper-middle-income 
countries.
55 Combined with the negative 
correlation that is found for extreme poverty, 
this provides additional evidence of the fact 
that, as national economies grow, people facing 
difficulties in accessing food, as captured by an 
experience-based indicator of food insecurity, 
have a higher risk of obesity.
56This analysis presents a number of 
limitations due to the nature of the data 
used, i.e. global data at the macro level. It is 
clearly insufficient to fully account for the 
reasons for the differential impact of food 
insecurity on adult obesity and other forms 
of malnutrition in different conditions. 
More insights can be gained from analysis of 
data at the household and individual levels 
that combine measures of food insecurity 
and of nutritional outcome, as explored in the 
next section.
| 43 |Links between food insecurity and various forms of malnutrition at the household and individual levelsThis section presents the results of a statistical 
analysis of micro-level data obtained from 
nationally representative surveys that included 
measures of household food insecurity and 
also of nutritional outcomes of their members. 
The ultimate objective of the analysis was 
to determine if living in a food-insecure 
household increases the probability of 
being affected by one of the various forms 
of malnutrition.
To ensure consistent measurement of food 
insecurity, one of the criteria used to select the 
surveys was that they should include either 
the FIES or a similar experience-based tool to 
measure household food insecurity, along with 
the nutritional outcome measures of individuals 
in the household. Although the number of 
such surveys covering both food security at the 
household level and nutrition at the individual 
level has increased, there are still too few 
to be able to provide a global assessment. 
Nevertheless, the study provides useful 
evidence from eight countries of diverse income 
levels from three main regions of the world.
As a preliminary step, the food-insecurity 
measure in each survey was calibrated to 
the global reference scale following the FIES 
methodology. This resulted in a measure that 
permitted classification of each household 
as being food secure or food insecure in a 
consistent way across the countries covered 
(Box 3
). Then, logistic regressions of the 
nutrition outcome condition were run at 
the individual level for each of the relevant 
population groups, as a function of the 
household food-insecurity status, controlling 
for age, sex, socio-economic status, household 
size/dependency ratio, and urban/rural 
residence. For child malnutrition outcomes, 
 the analyses also controlled for maternal 
education and for access to clean drinking 
water and basic sanitation facilities (see 
Annex˜2 and Ishaq 
et˜al
.57 for a full description 
of the methodology and results).

| 44 |The analysis (full results not shown here) 
reveals that living in a household classified as 
food insecure contributes to explain the status 
of being affected by one or another form of 
malnutrition in different population groups, 
 in seven of the eight countries studied. 
Indeed, in five of them, household food 
insecurity is found to be associated with 
more than one form of malnutrition. 
Table 
6 summarizes the results of regressions 
of overweight and obesity on household food 
insecurity only, not showing the coefficient 
estimates of other covariates.
58 The table shows how the association of food 
insecurity with overweight and obesity (across 
different age groups) varies depending on the 
income level of the country. In the low- and 
lower-middle-income countries considered, 
living in a food-insecure household either 
decreases the likelihood of being overweight 
or obese (Kenya and Pakistan) or has a very 
weak (Malawi) or no association (Nepal and 
Nigeria). In upper-middle- and high-income 
countries (Brazil, Mexico and the United 
States of America), food insecurity increases 
the likelihood of being overweight or obese, 
at least in some age groups. In Brazil, food 
insecurity is statistically correlated with 
obesity in the two age groups considered 
(p-value˜<˜0.05), while in the United States 
of America and Mexico the statistical 
significance of the association is strong 
(p-value < 0.01) for adults. The association 
for obesity in school-age children and 
adolescents is less strong for the United 
States and not statistically significant at the 
conventional significance levels for Mexico 
(p-value˜=˜0.117). Although this analysis was 
not designed to prove the hypothesis, the 
different direction of the association of food 
insecurity with adult obesity depending on the 
income level of the country is consistent with 
other evidence that a positive relationship 
is more likely in settings where highly 
processed, energy-dense foods are low-cost.
59 As mentioned in Section 1.2, in upper-middle- 
and high-income countries, such foods are 
ubiquitously available and cheap, while fresh, 
nutritious foods are often out of reach for 
those living on lower incomes. But in many 
low- and lower-middle-income countries, 
highly-processed, energy-dense foods are not 
readily available or affordable.

| 45 |Table 7
 summarizes the results of the analysis of 
association between household food insecurity 
and child undernutrition and anaemia in 
women of reproductive age, when controlling 
for other factors (see Annex 2 for details). 
Household food insecurity is associated with 
indicators of child undernutrition in most 
of the countries studied. Children living 
in food-insecure households in Brazil, 
Kenya, Malawi and Mexico are more likely 
to be stunted compared with those living in 
food-secure households. In Nigeria they are 
more likely to be wasted. No association is 
found in Nepal.
The association between food insecurity and 
anaemia in women of reproductive age could 
only be analysed in four of the eight countries 
due to data availability. In Brazil and Mexico, 
living in a food-insecure household was 
found to increase the likelihood of women 
being anaemic. In Nepal the prevalence of 
anaemia is similar among food-secure and 
food-insecure women. No association between 
food insecurity and anaemia is found in the 
United States of America.
As the analysis was conducted by controlling 
for income levels,
60
 it shows that, in general, 
the experience of food insecurity has 
implications for malnutrition regardless of 
the socio-economic status of the household. 
This points to the need for policies to go 
beyond merely addressing poverty and 
specifically improve access to food. 
 1.4 
 CONCLUSIONSThe trends in food insecurity and malnutrition 
in all its forms described in Part 1 pose a 
significant challenge to achieving SDG 2. 
The numbers of people suffering from hunger 
and food insecurity are no longer declining Œ 
on the contrary, they have been slowly on the 
rise in the last few years. While progress in 
bringing down the prevalence of stunting in 
children and increasing the rate of exclusive 
breastfeeding is to be commended, the rapid 
increase in obesity is alarming, and no 
region or income group is exempt from this 
problem. The global number of obese people 
surpassed the number of undernourished 
people already in 2016. Children facing hunger

| 46 |and food insecurity may have a higher risk of 
overweight, obesity and NCDs later in life, 
and unhealthy diets are now the leading risk 
factor for deaths worldwide. Therefore, it is 
imperative to continue addressing the urgent 
needs of those who are hungry, while at the 
same time going beyond hunger and ensuring 
access not only to sufficient food, but also to 
nutritious foods that constitute a healthy diet. 
In the search for a better understanding of how 
to achieve this, the new FIES-based indicator of 
moderate or severe food insecurity represents a 
valuable tool.  
Trends of the past several decades, as well 
as persistent socio-economic and geographic 
inequalities in food insecurity and malnutrition, 
highlight the need to address factors operating 
at the community, national and international 
levels that contribute to such inequalities. 
The second part of this report delves deeper 
into some of the fundamental determinants 
of food insecurity and malnutrition related 
to underlying economic structures and 
inequalities.

PART 2
 SUSTAINED
 ESCAPES
 FROM FOOD 
INSECURITY AND 
MALNUTRITION
 IN THE FACE
 OF ECONOMIC 
SLOWDOWNS AND 
DOWNTURNS
As shown in Part 1 of this report, almost one 
out of every nine people in the world suffers 
from hunger, and the number of hungry people 
is growing, albeit slowly. At the same time, 
reductions in child stunting are insufficient to 
meet global goals, and obesity and overweight 
are on the rise. 
Previous editions of this report have identified 
three drivers behind these problematic trends: 
conflict, climate and economic slowdowns. 
These drivers are complex and often interact 
with compounding effects that challenge 
food security and nutrition in multiple ways. 
Unless greater and more targeted efforts 
are made to address these drivers and the 
underlying causes of hunger and malnutrition, 
it is increasingly clear that the goal of ending 
hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 
will not be achieved.
In 2017, this report made it clear that 
efforts to fight hunger and malnutrition in 
conflict-affected situations must go hand in 
hand with actions for immediate humanitarian 
assistance and long-term development that 
builds resilience and helps sustain peace. 
In 2018, the report called for urgent action 
to scale up and accelerate policies and 
programmes to build climate resilience. 
This year, this second part of the report looks 
more closely at how the third key driver, 
economic slowdowns Œ and, more specifically, 
also economic downturns Œ has contributed to the 
recent rise in hunger with possible implications 
for nutrition. This is critical to understanding 
future trends in hunger and malnutrition, 
especially given the dark predictions of the 
latest global economic prospects, with slowing 
and stalled economic growth in many countries, 
including emerging and developing economies. 
Indeed, episodes of financial stress, elevated 
trade tensions and tightening financial conditions 
are all contributing to bleaker global economic 
prospects.
1Importantly, the impact of economic slowdowns 
and downturns on food security and nutrition 
cannot be separated from the root causes of 
hunger and malnutrition: poverty, inequality and 
marginalization. Part 2 therefore looks closely 
at the relationship between poverty and food 
security and nutrition, and how they interact 
with inequality and marginalization to threaten 
food security and nutrition. 
The purpose of the analysis is to provide 
guidance on how these challenges can be 
overcome to end hunger and malnutrition in 
all its forms. The last section thus presents 
policies and programmes that can protect the 
most vulnerable from the impact of economic 
slowdowns and downturns, while fostering food 
security and nutrition from a perspective of 
more inclusive economic growth. Ending hunger 
and malnutrition by 2030 (SDG Targets 2.1 and 
2.2) will require greater efforts and integrated 
approaches to eradicate extreme poverty (SDG˜1), 
ensure decent work and inclusive economic 
growth (SDG 8), and reduce inequalities 
(SDG˜10).

 FOOD SECURITY 
 AND NUTRITION 
 KEY MESSAGES 
 The outlook for the global economy has darkened, 
reflecting risks of increasing trade tensions and rising 
global borrowing costs.
 Hunger has been on the rise in countries where the 
economy has slowed down or contracted. The uneven 
pace of global economic recovery raises concerns 
regarding prospects for ending hunger and 
malnutrition in all its forms. 
 Most countries (84 percent) that experienced a rise 
in undernourishment between 2011 and 2017 
simultaneously suffered an economic slowdown or 
downturn Œ and the majority of these are 
middle-income countries.
 While conflict and climate shocks were the key 
drivers of food crises in 2018, economic shocks were 
significant secondary and tertiary drivers in more than 
half of the countries affected by food crises and 
worsened the severity of these food crises for 
96˜million people.
 Rises in the prevalence of undernourishment in 
countries that faced economic downturns tend to be 
higher (5.1 percentage points) than countries 
vulnerable to climate extremes (2.3 percentage points 
higher) and countries that experienced conflict 
(2.2 percentage points higher).
How are economic slowdowns and downturns relevant to the quest to eradicate hunger and malnutrition? Hunger has been on the rise in many countries 
where the economy has slowed down or 
contracted. Between 2011 and 2017, this 
increase coincided with an economic slowdown 
or downturn in 65 out of 77 countries. 
Economic shocks that typically result in economic 
slowdowns or downturns tend to be significant 
secondary and tertiary drivers that prolong and 
worsen the severity of food crises, especially 
in countries experiencing acute food insecurity 
requiring urgent humanitarian assistance.
2 In 
2018, economic shocks featured prominently in 
33 out of the 53 countries that suffered from food 
crises, affecting more than 96 million people 
(Table 8
).An economic slowdown generally means 
economic activity is sluggish, although it 
continues to grow. When there is no growth, 
the economy has reached a downturn (
Box 9
). 
These economic phenomena often lead to a rise 
in unemployment and decline in wages and 
incomes, challenging access to food and essential 
social services for the poor. People™s access to 
high-quality, nutritious food, which tends to be 
less affordable Œ especially for poor people who 
spend a large portion of their income on food Œ 
can be affected, as can access to basic services 
such as health care. 
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 
2019
| 51 |The uneven pace of global economic recovery 
from slowdowns further raises concerns 
regarding prospects for ending hunger and 
malnutrition in all its forms. Recent world 
economic reports highlight that slowdowns, 
stagnation and outright recessions are evident 
in several economies and already leading 
to increased unemployment and declines in 
income.
3 There may soon be yet another global 
economic downturn. Early this year, the IMF 
revised
˜its forecast for global growth to the 
lowest level since the global financial crisis a 
decade ago, as the outlook dimmed in most 
 major economies.
4 This dark outlook reflects increasing risks 
related to rising trade tensions, weakening 
investments, increasing government and 
corporate debt, and rising borrowing costs. 
According to the World Bank, further escalation 
of trade tensions and the associated uncertainty 
could weaken growth even further.
5 Moreover, 
the outlook for commodity prices, especially 
oil, is vulnerable to policy-related risks and 
the collective intervention of many countries Œ
particular through trade policies Œ may amplify 
international price movements, and may not 
be effective in protecting the most vulnerable 
populations groups.
6Trade tensions, which are increasingly taking 
a toll on business confidence, are a particular 
concern. After strong growth in 2017 and 
2018, the global economy™s slowdown reflects 
a confluence of factors, including USŒChina 
trade tensions. Global trade has also slowed 
considerably. Moreover, escalation and tariff 
hikes between the two largest economies of the 
world could further weaken growth and put 
pressure on the price of commodities. This is 
because higher tariffs will increase the price of 
imported goods, disrupt global value chains, 
One of the primary measures used to gauge the health 
of a country™s economy is gross domestic product 
(GDP). Often referred to as the size of the economy, 
 it is the total value of economic activity within a 
country measured as the total value of goods and 
services produced during a given period of time. 
The economic growth rate is the percentage increase 
or decrease of GDP from one period to another. 
An economic slowdown is when economic activity 
is growing at a slower pace. In other words, there still 
is growth in economic activity, but at a slower rate than 
before. An economic slowdown occurs when real GDP 
growth declines from one period of time to another but 
is still positive, usually measured in quarters of a year. 
An economic downturn
 is when there is no growth, 
but rather a period of decline in economic activity. 
It refers to a period of economic contraction or 
negative economic growth as measured by the growth 
rate in real GDP. An 
economic recession,1 often used 
synonymously with economic downturn
, is a temporary 
or short-term downturn in economic growth, usually 
occurring over at least two consecutive quarters of 
decline. Stagnation is period where an economy grows 
at an extremely low rate without actually entering 
a recession.An economic shock is an unexpected or 
unpredictable event that is external to the specific 
economy and can either harm or boost it. A global 
financial crisis causing bank lending or credit to fall, 
or an economic downturn in a major trading partner 
of a country, reflect demand-side shocks that can 
have multiple effects on spending and investment. 
A steep rise in oil and gas prices, natural disasters 
that result in sharp falls in production, or conflict 
that disrupts trade and production, are examples of 
supply-side shocks. 
See Annex 3 for the full definitions used in the 
analysis of this report, as well as the methodology 
applied in the measuring of economic slowdowns 
and downturns.

weaken investment.
7Global demand for commodities could slow down 
by one-third over the next decade,
8 especially for 
agriculture and metals, and countries dependent 
on commodity exports may struggle to adjust. 
Rising risks combined with high vulnerabilities 
will challenge emerging and developing 
economies™ ability to manage economic shocks. 
A bleak economic outlook may translate into 
more poverty and inequality, hindering efforts 
to eradicate hunger and malnutrition in all its 
forms. While extreme poverty rates have declined 
from 54 percent in 1990 to 41 percent in 2015 
in sub-Saharan Africa, the number of extreme 
poor increased by 136 million people during this 
period, i.e. from 277 to 413 million. Even more 
worrying, inequality is rising in nearly half of the 
countries around the world, including in several 
low- and middle-income countries.
9Trends in economic slowdowns and downturns
The percentage variation of real GDP per capita 
growth from one period to another, or economic 
growth rate, is typically used to gauge whether 
an economy is slowing down or contracting. 
In most regions, this rate rebounded after the 
sharp 2008Œ2009 global economic downturn. 
But the recovery was uneven and short lived, as 
many countries experienced generally declining 
trends in growth since 2011 (
Figure 22
). Real GDP 
per capita growth is also being challenged 
particularly in countries with rapidly growing 
populations, like those in Africa and South 
Asia, regions with some of the highest levels of 
food insecurity and malnutrition in the world 
(Table 1
).

last few years, real GDP per capita growth 
on average declined in seven subregions, 
five of which experienced negative growth in 
different years (
Figure 23
). In 2018, these five 
subregions combined were home to almost 
263 million undernourished people and more 
than 56 million stunted
 children under the age 
of five. Further
 setbacks are expected to continue 
in many of these regions, including in Middle, 
Southern and West Africa; Western Asia; and 
Latin America and the Caribbean.
10 Economic slowdowns and downturns can be 
triggered by myriad factors. International 
factors can negatively affect economic growth 
for specific countries through trade flows, world 
prices, foreign direct investment (FDI) and other 
foreign exchange flows (remittances, foreign 
borrowing, aid and so forth). National factors, 
notably monetary, fiscal and trade policies, as 
well as investment and sectoral policies can 
also drive economic slowdowns and downturns. 
But there may also be non-economic factors 
driving economic deceleration, including 
political factors, conflict and climate shocks. 
Some of these factors can be felt across borders. 
For example, widespread civil insecurity can 
disrupt production and trade flows and lead 
to migration. 
Rises in undernourishment in places where the economy slowed down or contractedAs seen from Part 1, both the prevalence 
of undernourishment and the number of 
undernourished people in the world began to 
increase in 2016. For many countries, especially 
low- and lower-middle-income countries, 
as well as countries affected by conflict and 
adverse climate events, undernourishment 
was on the rise as early as 2011. It was only in 
2016 that the number of countries with rising 
undernourishment became sufficient for the 
increase to be reflected in the global aggregate of 
world hunger.
11 Establishing a direct causal relationship between 
economic growth and undernourishment is 
complicated, given how the PoU is computed 
and smoothed over time.
12 On the other hand, 
examining whether increasing change points in 
the prevalence of undernourishment is inversely 
associated with the real GDP per capita growth 
rate is straightforward.

increase in the prevalence of undernourishment

During the period 2011Œ2017, out of the 
120 increasing change points in the PoU of 
77˜countries (out of a sample of 134 low- and 
middle-income countries), 96 increasing change 
points in 65 countries corresponded with 
the occurrence of an economic slowdown or 
downturn (
Figure 24
, see Annex 3 for the list of

 This means that for 84 percent of the 
countries, the rise in undernourishment since 
2011 coincided with the occurrence of economic 
slowdowns or downturns. Moreover, many of 
these countries saw increasing change points in 
PoU coinciding with an economic slowdown or 
downturn in more than one year: 17 countries 
saw them in two years, and seven countries 
saw them in three out of the seven years.

in economic downturn. Interestingly, the PoU

people undernourished in the world as a whole 
declined steadily from 2005 to 2015 (Figure 1). 
The global food crisis of 2007Œ2008 and the global 
financial crisis of 2008Œ2009 occurred in between. 
So how was this possible? 
These crises were preceded by a period of 
sustained economic growth in the world (Figure 22), 
including in different developing regions, which 
are home to millions of undernourished people and 
people affected by malnutrition. Subsequently, the 
global economic downturn in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, North America and Europe, and slowdown 
in other regions during 2008Œ2009 was short lived 
and the world economy started to grow again in 2010. 
While this refers to aggregate trends for the world and 
across regions, it is still interesting to see that only nine 
countries witnessed the simultaneous occurrence of an 
economic slowdown or downturn and an increase in 
the PoU during these crises (Figure 24).In addition to growth, other factors came 
into play to prevent an increase in the number of 
undernourished people during these crises. During the 
global food crisis, for example, international food 
prices increased sharply between 2007 and early 
2008, reaching their highest level in the summer of 
2008.1 Many countries responded to the food price 
surge with policies softening the pass-through of 
international prices on markets and households
2 Œ a 
transmission mechanism explained later in this report. 
There is evidence that the increase in domestic prices 
was significantly lower and that domestic prices were 
also less volatile than world prices.3 Furthermore, 
FAOSTAT data show that the production of cereals 
increased in low- and middle-income countries during 
the global food crisis. This may also have been an 
important factor mediating the increase in domestic 
prices and contributing to employment creation and 
improvements in food security.
An additional explanation would be the coping 
mechanisms of net food-consuming households. 
A cross-country analysis of how families coped with 
the high food price crisis shows relatively large 
increases in dietary energy consumption among the 
highest income quintiles in urban areas in Guatemala, 
Honduras and Nicaragua. This indicates that 
households were consuming more energy-dense foods 
such as street foods or fast foods instead of more 
nutritious, diversified but costly diets. While these 
coping mechanisms of households help maintain overall 
dietary energy reduction, they may affect nutrition with 
long-term and potentially intergenerational negative 
effects on health and productivity.
4 The global financial crisis, on the other hand, 
originated as a result of a financial ﬁmeltdownﬂ in 
developed countries with serious implications for the 
real economy, affecting several parts of the world. 
However, with the exception of transition countries in 
Central and Eastern Europe, financial institutions in 
developing countries were not affected by ﬁfinancial 
contagionﬂ. Developing countries™ banks did not 
hold ﬁcontaminatedﬂ assets (i.e. those including 
sub-prime mortgages). Therefore, the major channels 
of transmission were through trade and financial 
flows between developed and developing countries. 
The effects were short lived considering the resumption 
of economic growth in 2010 (Figure 22).Many developing countries took advantage 
of the period of sustained economic growth 
preceding the crisis to implement fiscal and 
economic reforms. Following the Latin American 
and Asian crises of the 1990s, several countries 
had carried out macroeconomic reforms to make 
their economies more resilient to shocks, including 
closer bank supervision and reserve accumulation. 
Many countries were also able to implement policies 
aimed at reducing or neutralizing antisocial effects 
of economic cycles, such as policies encouraging 
spending during downturns Œ also known as 
countercyclical policies. Using a sample of 33 low- 
and middle-income countries, a study shows that 
the majority of these (20 countries) increased public 
social expenditure relative to total public expenditure 
during the global financial crisis.5 Although hunger declined steadily during both 
the global food crisis and financial crisis, not only 
for the world but also across developing regions 
(see Table 1
 in Part 1 for changes in the PoU between 
2005 and 2010), it is likely that the state of food 
security and nutrition did change in some countries6 and some population groups may have experienced 
increased hunger or malnutrition. The variation 
may not have been reflected in the numbers at 
the national level, however, as probably only the 
| 56 |only increased in a handful of countries during 
two consecutive crises: the global food crisis and 
the global financial crisis (for explanations of 
this, see 
Box 10
).The greatest number of countries where rising 
undernourishment occurred while the economy 
slowed down or stagnated are in Africa (32). 
Several are in Asia (17), followed by Latin 
America and the Caribbean (11), Oceania (3) 
 and Eastern Europe (2). The majority of them 
 (44 out of 65) are middle-income countries; 
19˜(out of 65) are low-income countries, of which 
17 are located in Africa with the exception of 
Tajikistan and Yemen. 
Notably, 80 percent of the countries (52˜out 
of 65) that experienced an increase in 
undernourishment while their economy slowed 
down or contracted depend highly on food and 
fuel commodity imports and/or oil and other 
primary commodity exports for foreign exchange 
and tax revenue generation (see Annex 6 for 
list of countries by commodity dependence).
14 As noted above, world prices are one of the 
international factors that can contribute to the 
deterioration of a country™s economic state. 
A sharp and persistent reduction of commodity 
prices affects commodity-dependent countries, 
triggering a number of economy-wide effects, 
including reductions in foreign exchange and tax 
revenue, with potentially adverse impacts on food 
security and nutrition. 
To provide statistical evidence that the relationship 
between changes in undernourishment and 
economic slowdowns and downturns is more than 
a simple corresponding occurrence, a regression 
analysis comparing the difference in the PoU and 
the real GDP per capita growth between 2011 and 
2017
15 was carried out. It points to a statistically 
significant correlation between the two (see 
Annex 4 for model and results). On average, a ten 
percent decrease in economic growth between 
2011 and 2017 corresponds to a 1.5 percentage 
point increase in the PoU between 2011 and 2017. 
Furthermore, countries that have experienced 
economic downturns show significant increases 
in the PoU between 2011 and 2017, equal to 
5.1 percentage points higher than countries with 
economies that have not contracted.
The correlation, as expected, varies from country 
to country. On average, low-income countries 
most vulnerable households before the two crises, 
experienced food insecurity during these crises, 
 as studies for some countries show.
6 Some national 
reports also point to increased prevalence of 
different forms of malnutrition in certain population 
groups: in China, for example, the prevalence 
of stunting among infants7 in poorer rural areas 
increased between 2008 and 2010.8  1 For more details on the factors behind rising food prices during this period, see: C.L. Gilbert. 2010. How to understand high food prices.

terms of magnitude of the estimated coefficient, 
almost double that of vulnerability to climate 
and conflict. In fact, countries with economic 
downturns have a 5.1 percentage point higher 
PoU than countries without, whereas countries 
with vulnerability to climate and conflict have 
a 2.3 and 2.2 percentage point higher PoU, 
respectively (see 
Table A4.3
 in Annex 4).
When PoU increases are estimated within 
income groups, upper-middle-income countries 
with economic downturns show the highest 
PoU increase, i.e. a 6.3 percentage point higher 
PoU increase between 2011 and 2017 than 
upper-middle-income countries without economic 
downturns. On the contrary, low-income 
countries are those with the highest PoU increase 
associated with climate vulnerability and conflict. 
These countries experience a 4.8 percentage point 
higher PoU increase in the presence of climate 
vulnerability compared to low-income countries 
without and, when affected by conflict, they report 
a 5.5 percentage point higher PoU (see 
 Tables A4.4a
 and 
b in Annex 4). First, this is in line 
with studies suggesting that conflicts are more 
likely to erupt in low-income economies, leading to 
the most dangerous increases in hunger.
16 Second, 
low-income countries are the only countries that 
experience a significant PoU increase associated 
with vulnerability to climate (see 
Tables A4.4a
 and 
b in 
Annex 4). Quite importantly, this result deriving 
from a macro-level analysis, confirms extensive 
findings from the microeconomic literature Œ 
that climate extremes have a disproportionately 
negative effect on the poorest populations living 
in remote areas in terms of consumption and 
food security.
17 Although a correlation analysis 
describes the association between the three 
drivers and the change in PoU, it is difficult to 
disentangle the contribution of each of the three 
drivers, given that conflict and climate shocks 
can also affect economic growth, and therefore 
indirectly affect undernourishment.
Economic slowdowns and downturns  worsen global food crises Countries experiencing crisis levels of acute food 
insecurity also typically experience economic 
disarray. In the last three years (2016Œ2018), 
more than 100 million people every year 
have faced periods of acute food insecurity.
18 In˜2018, 113 million people across 53 countries 
and territories faced c
risis
 levels of acute food 
insecurity or worse (IPC Phase 3 and above or 
equivalent)
19 where urgent humanitarian actions 
were needed to save lives and livelihoods, 
as well as to address high or above-average 
acute malnutrition. 
Analysis of acute food insecurity, including the 
drivers behind the food crisis, carried out at 
the country level, sheds light on how economic 
slowdowns and downturns worsen food crises.
20 It shows that, in 2018, conflict remained the key 
driver of food crises, affecting around 74 million 
people, two-thirds of whom faced acute food 
insecurity. Climate and natural disasters were 
the primary driver of acute food insecurity for 
another 29 million people. Economic shocks were 
the primary driver of acute food insecurity for 
10.2 million people.
While economic shocks are rarely the primary 
drivers of food crises, they are significant 
secondary or tertiary drivers of them. In many 
instances, significant economic shocks Œ or even 
not-so-significant shocks that occur in fragile 
economies Œ can undermine economic activity, 
worsen the severity of acute food insecurity, 
and prolong the duration of the crisis. In fact, 
more than 96 million people in 33 countries who 
suffered from acute food insecurity in 2018 lived 
in places where the economy was undergoing 
economic shocks of rising unemployment, lack 
of regular work, currency depreciation and high 
food prices (
Table 8
 and Annex 5 for the list of 
countries by economic shock).
21 The economy 
of most of these countries (27 out of 33) was 
contracting, according to their real GDP per 
capita growth for 2015Œ2017.
In food crisis contexts, the interaction between 
conflict and economic slowdowns and 
downturns is particularly important. Not only 
is conflict the main driver behind food crises, 
| 59 |but it also often triggers economic slowdowns, 
downturns and deep economic recessions 
that compound the severity and duration of 
the food crisis.
22 In 2018, conflict and civil 
insecurity were the major driver of food crises 
in 21 countries Œ 14 of them experienced deep 
economic recessions with an average negative 
difference of 2.4 percentage points in economic 
growth between years 2014 and 2017.
23 Economic slowdowns and downturns often lead 
to increased levels of unemployment and limited 
income opportunities, which erode household 
purchasing power, exacerbating food insecurity

24 The loss of income and 
unemployment in turn feature as key contributing 
factors in several of the food crises, especially in 
countries facing economic downturns (
Table 8
).As the next section shows, persistent slowdowns 
and sharp downturns in the economy can drain 
foreign currency reserves, potentially triggering 
national currency depreciations with a number of 
knock-on effects detrimental to food security and 
nutrition, including food price inflation. This is 
especially the case for countries dependent 
on food imports. Seventy-five percent of the 
countries with food crises that also suffered from 
economic shocks are net food importers (25 out 
of 33) with the value of food imports outweighing 
the country™s value of food exports.
Economic slowdowns and downturns can 
constrain national financial capacities to provide 
essential services, protect the poor and respond 
effectively to crises. Furthermore, political 
instability limits the capacity of governments to 
support their populations during food crises, and 
therefore economic downturns, especially if they 
are severe, can further compound the impacts of 
this instability on food crises. 
Economic slowdowns and downturns can also 
lower the resilience capacity of households to 
respond to other shocks Œ including climate 
shocks. For example, the climatic impact of El 
Niño in Southern Africa in 2016 led to more 
than 12 million food-insecure people in need 
of urgent humanitarian action in six countries. 
The impact of this phenomenon was intensified 
by already ongoing economic slowdowns and 
downturns in several countries, which weakened 
households™ capacity to respond effectively to 
the climate shock and contributed to lowering 
the resilience of households already debilitated 
by a poor agricultural season in 2015. This was 
the case for Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), 
Mozambique and Zimbabwe. While households 
may be able to cope with and recover from 
transitory shocks, multiple and recurring 
shocks are increasingly the norm, adding to 
the vulnerability of the poor. Aggregate and 
recurring shocks tend to result in poverty traps 
or slips back into poverty, generating harmful 
effects on present food security and nutrition, 
and on future generations.

  COMMODITY 
DEPENDENCE AND ITS 
RELEVANCE FOR FOOD 
SECURITY AND 
NUTRITION 
 KEY MESSAGES 
 Eighty percent of the countries (52 out of 65) with 
a rise in hunger during recent economic slowdowns 
and downturns are countries whose economies are 
highly dependent on primary commodities for export 
and/or import. 
 In 2018, 807˜million undernourished people and 
154˜million stunted children under the age of five lived 
in low- and middle-income countries: of these, 
respectively, around 381˜million and 73˜million lived 
in high commodity-dependent countries. The latter 
also were home to almost 109˜million out of the 
113˜million people facing crisis levels of acute food 
insecurity requiring urgent humanitarian actions. 
 Changes in commodity prices affect the relative 
value of exports and imports in these countries. 
Foreign exchange drains, depreciation and 
devaluation of currencies may pass through the 
economic system, resulting in rising domestic prices, 
unemployment, loss of wages, and consequently loss 
of incomes. 
 These events pose macroeconomic aggregate 
shocks affecting multiple households, rather than 
idiosyncratic shocks that only affect a single 
household. Many vulnerable households see their 
purchasing power reduced, while coping strategies 
they use during idiosyncratic once-off shocks are 
not effective.
 The need to change consumption patterns can 
lead vulnerable households to cut spending on a 
range of basic services for health and disease 
prevention or shift away from nutrient-rich foods 
towards more energy-dense but nutrient-poor foods. 
Households may also see the supply of basic services 
compromised if the fiscal space to provide essential 
social public expenditure becomes more limited. 
| 61 |Commodity price trends and boomsInternational, regional and national factors can 
harm economic activity in ways that challenge 
food security and nutrition. Understanding 
the mechanisms through which economic 
slowdowns and downturns contribute to the 
recent, unwelcoming trends in food security 
and nutrition can be approached from different 
angles as it is ultimately country-specific. 
However, there is a steady trend affecting 
many of the countries where hunger is lately on 
the rise.
Low- and middle-income countries are, by and 
large, well integrated with the world economy, 
though to different degrees and in different 
ways. They trade goods and services with other 
countries, invest in them or receive investors 
from them, and exchange different types of 
flows, including financial capital, foreign aid, 
foreign borrowing, remittances and others. 
This integration, of course, exposes them to 
external vulnerabilities depending on the 
structural features of their economies. 
In this regard, a key vulnerability arises relating 
to what these countries produce and what they 
trade with the rest of the world: essentially, 
primary commodities. The trend in rising 
commodity prices that started in 2003 and 
the period of extreme price volatility in 2008 
have been followed by largely declining global 
commodity prices for five consecutive years from 
2011 to 2016 (
Figure 26
). As a result, commodity 
prices fell by more than nine percent in this 
period. As indicated earlier, global commodity 
demand is also in decline and the outlook is 
that its growth could slow over the next decade, 
especially for agriculture and metals.
Although global commodity price levels are still 
higher than during the pre-commodity price 
boom in 2007Œ2008, most countries that are 
highly dependent on exporting commodities to 
generate revenues have not been able to use their 
commodity windfalls during commodity price 
booms to diversify their economies and reduce 
their vulnerability to price shocks. Today many 
are as commodity dependent as before, if not 
more so, with few exceptions such as Argentina, 
China and Mexico.
26 There are many reasons 
for this. Diversification and upgrading of the 
productive structures and capabilities from 
which wealth is created and distributed are not 
easy tasks and take years to achieve.
27 Effective 
policies, effective collaboration between public 
and private sectors, and high levels of investment 
are also needed. 
Furthermore, benefits during boom periods 
are by far outweighed by the negative impacts 
caused by price volatility and low-price 
periods, which tend to be longer than boom 
periods.
28 Moreover, the negative impacts on 
net food importers during periods of high food 
prices can be extremely severe, as witnessed 
during the food price crises of 2007˚2008 and 
2010˚2012. 
Why does commodity dependence matter? Commodity dependence matters because it 
increases the vulnerability of countries to world 
price swings. The vulnerability to changing 
commodity prices arises as countries produce and 
trade commodities and, in most cases, low- and 
middle-income countries are world price-takers 
that cannot affect them. They may not be in 
a position to influence these prices alone. 
They may also not be in a position to undergo 
the structural transformation to move them away 
from commodity dependence. 
The association between economic performance 
and commodity prices in commodity-dependent 
countries is strong and therefore makes them 
especially vulnerable to the volatility of global 
commodity prices.
29 Recent slowdowns and 
downturns in economic growth in many regions 
are largely explained by marked declines in 
commodity prices. This is mainly affecting 
countries dependent on primary commodity 
exports, particularly in South America, but also 
other regions including Asia and some countries 
in Africa.
30Countries from these regions are commodity-
 export-dependent as they derive the bulk 
of their export earnings from primary 
commodities. This report not only focuses on 
this type of countries, but also on countries 
showing commodity-import dependence and 
net food-import dependence (see 
Box 11
 for 
| 62 |definitions). Commodity-import-dependent 
countries have a high ratio of food and fuel 
imports to total merchandise trade, while 
commodity-export-dependent countries derive 
the bulk of their export earnings from primary 
commodities. Net food importers are countries 
where the value of imports of basic foodstuffs 
outweighs the value of food exports. Out of a 
total of 134 low- and middle-income countries 
studied for the period 1995Œ2017, 102 countries 
are classified according to the three types of high 
commodity dependence, whereas the remaining 
32 are low commodity dependent. 
High commodity-dependent countries exhibit 
combinations of commodity-import and -export 
dependence, which entail different vulnerabilities 
to commodity prices and links with food security 
and nutrition. For example, out of 134 low- and 
middle-income countries in the period 1995Œ2017, 
34 are high commodity-export-dependent 
but low commodity-import-dependent, 25 are

high commodity-export- and commodity-import-

). 
Out of the 134 low- and middle-income countries, 
97 are net food importers. Of these, 80 also 
show some degree of commodity dependence: 
23 high commodity-export dependence, 20 high 
commodity-import dependence, and 37 have 
both types of dependence (
Figure 27
, see Annex 6 
for the list of countries by type of commodity 
dependency and income level). 
International commodity price shocks and 
volatility can potentially create harmful 
impacts for food security and nutrition in all 
combinations of high commodity dependence. 
For example, as highlighted above, most of the 
countries (52 out of 65) that experienced rising 
undernourishment in correspondence with 
economic deceleration during 2011Œ2017 are 
highly dependent on primary commodity exports 
and/or imports, of which many (42 out of 65) 
rely heavily on oil and other primary commodity 
export revenues. For several of the countries 
affected by food crises considered above, most of 
which are net food-import dependent 
 (25 out of 33), inflationary pressure stemming 
from the depreciation of national currencies 
against the US dollar was a key factor that 
contributed to an escalation in food prices. In 2018 
most (27 out of 33 or 81 percent) of the food 
crisis countries where economic shocks worsened 
the severity of acute food insecurity were high 
primary commodity-dependent countries.  
In 2018, 807 million undernourished people and 
154 million stunted children under the age of 
five lived in low- and middle-income countries: 
of these, respectively, around 381 million and 
73 million lived in high commodity-dependent 
countries. For countries facing food crises, the 2018 
situation was even worse: almost 109 million out of 
the 113 million people facing crisis levels of acute 
food insecurity requiring urgent humanitarian 
actions
31 also lived in low- and middle-income, 
high commodity-dependent countries.

Commodity-export-dependent 
countries or territories 
derive the bulk of their export earnings from primary 
commodities, such as minerals, ores, metals, fuels, 
agriculture raw materials and food. This report defines 
high commodity-export-dependent
 countries as those 
who generate more than 60 percent of their 
merchandise export revenues from food, agriculture 
and raw materials; minerals, ores, and metals; and/or 
energy commodities. Following UNCTAD and FAO,
1 this threshold corresponds to the minimum threshold 
denoting the most negative association between 
commodity-export dependence and 
human development.Commodity-import-dependent 
countries or 
territories have a high ratio of commodity imports to 
total import merchandise traded. This includes essential 
goods, such as food items and fuel. The report defines 
high commodity-import-dependent 
countries as those 
where the share of the value of food and fuel imports 
is more than 30 percent of the total merchandise. 
This threshold is the average for developing countries 
in 1995Œ2014 and the one applied in the UNCTAD 
and FAO

Net food importers 
are countries or territories 
where the value of imports of basic foodstuffs 
outweighs the value of exports of basic foodstuffs.

high net food importers
 as those 
countries having a negative average food trade 
balance in the years from 2013 to 2015, following the

growth and most of these (15 countries) also 
saw rises in undernourishment in this period 
or a worsening food crisis situation in 2018 (see 
Table˜A6.3
 in Annex 6 for the list of countries and 
the number of consecutive years of downturns).
Among high commodity-dependent countries, 
especially high commodity-export-dependent 
countries, increases in undernourishment 
associated with economic slowdowns or 
downturns depend on the main sector of country 
exports. Countries dependent on exports of fuel, 
minerals and metals have been the most exposed 
to downturns Œ even if these commodities 
come from very different sectors. Specifically, 
35 percent (14 out of 40) of the countries with 
downturns in 2016Œ2017 were dependent on 
said exports. 
A recent FAO study sampling 129 low- and 
middle-income countries during 1995Œ2017 finds 
that high levels of export and import dependence 
on primary commodities have a statistically 
significant and negative effect on food security 
(Table 9
).32 In the period considered, an average 
increase of primary commodity-export dependence 
by 1 percent leads to a 2.2 percent increase in the 
PoU per year on average. For commodity-import 
dependence, the correlation is stronger, as it 
causes an average increase in undernourishment 
of 3.8 percent per year. This average effect is

countries, compared with middle-income 
countries, since they experience a higher level of 
the PoU in the presence of commodity dependence.
The same FAO study also finds that, when 
commodity-import dependence is unpacked, 
food-import dependence has a bigger and stronger 
effect on the PoU than fuel-import dependence. 
Food-import dependence is associated with an 
8 percent increase in PoU per year on average, 
whereas fuel-import dependence does not report a 
statistically significant coefficient. 
The two successive and sharp commodity price 
booms in 2007Œ2008 and 2010Œ2011 offered an 
economic bonanza to most commodity-export-
dependent countries (
Figure 26
 and 
28). Many 
registered a large increase in export revenues 
and generally saw increased economic growth. 
For net food importers and high commodity-
import-dependent countries, however, such 
price booms can create additional challenges 
for food security and nutrition. This can 
particularly be the case for net buyers of food 
through imported food price inflation. On the 
other hand, high food prices, especially cereal 
prices, can be a strong incentive for increased 
agricultural production, whereby the positive 
effects of this outweigh the negative effects of 
high food prices (e.g. for net buyers of food) 
with overall positive net effects on food security 
and nutrition. This was the case in many 
countries during the 2007Œ2008 global food 
crisis (
Box 10
). 
New FAO evidence suggests that economic 
growth, even if strong during price booms for 
high commodity-export-dependent countries, 
does not necessarily translate into improved food 
security and nutrition.
33 This study finds that, 
during the period 1995Œ2017, both food-import 
dependence and export dependence on primary 
commodities have a negative effect on PoU, even 
when controlling for the price booms between 
2003 and 2011 (excluding the sharp commodity 
price drop in 2008Œ2009, see 
Figure 26
). The years 
of the commodity price booms seem to have a 
positive effect on hunger, although the effect is 
very small (
Table 9
). Economic growth in many of 
these cases is not fairly distributed and does not 
trickle down sufficiently, and in some cases not 
at all to the poorest and most food-insecure and 
malnourished populations Œ as further explained 
next in the report. 
This is consistent with a recent comprehensive 
study of 202 countries over the period between 
1995 and 2014, which finds that high levels 
of commodity dependence are statistically 
significant and negatively affect social (education 
and health) and human development in 
general and results are statistically significant. 
This effect was found to pass through several 
channels, including the negative secular terms 
of trade affecting commodity-dependent

by another study that finds ﬁnon-monetaryﬂ 
indicators of development (e.g. health and 
education) are negatively correlated with 
commodity dependence through macroeconomic 
volatility and distributional inequalities.
35Commodity dependence and food security  and nutrition: transmission channelsDesigning policies to help offset the 
vulnerability that arises with high commodity 
dependence requires a thorough understanding 
of the potential effects. These effects are 
mediated through a number of direct and 
indirect channels that link global commodity 
markets with domestic economic, social and 
human development outcomes, including 
food security and nutrition. The transmission 
channels in such contexts are complex, and 
a given commodity price change does not 
affect all commodity-dependent countries in a 
uniform manner. 
Figure 
29 presents a simplified 
overview of these transmission channels.
 The transmission channels can be grouped into 
four broad areas, which are the main subject of 
analysis in this section. They are:
 Direct impacts
 emanating as the change 
in commodity prices affects terms of trade, 
exchange rate adjustments and the balance 
of payments. 
 Secondary indirect effects of these 
macroeconomic impacts on:
 domestic prices, including food;
 unemployment, declining wages and loss of 
income; and
 health and social services.
Ultimately, an important critical factor that 
determines whether the direct and indirect 
impacts affect food security and nutrition is the 
ability of individuals and households to cope 
with these economic-related shocks. The last part 
of this section takes a closer look at how people 
cope and when their coping capacities fail. 
Terms of trade, exchange rate and balance 
 of payments Macroeconomic performance in commodity-dependent 
countries tends to move with commodity price 
cycles. Economic activity and growth and external 
and fiscal balances deteriorate/improve during 
commodity price downswings/upswings, whether 
the latter entail long periods of falling/rising 
commodity prices or shorter commodity price 
swings that last only few years.
36 From the perspective of low-income countries, 
especially those where the principal means of 
foreign exchange earnings come from the exports 
of primary commodities, unstable commodity 
prices create macroeconomic instabilities and 
complicate macroeconomic management (
Figure 29
).Terms of trade shocks and volatility 
Sharp declines or increases in international 
primary commodity prices can lead to 
changes in the terms of trade (ToT) for 
commodity-dependent countries. That is to say, 
the ratio between the prices at which a country 
sells its exports and the prices it pays for its 
imports is affected. A reduction in this ratio 
reflects a deterioration in the ToT which can have 
implications on economic growth, with further 
economy-wide implications as both supply and 
demand factors respond to the shock. 
In fact, ToT shocks have been shown to carry 
the highest economic output costs among a 
range of external shocks for a large number of 
developing countries.
37 Low-income countries 
are especially vulnerable. The IMF has found 
that low-income countries are almost six times 
more often affected by severe ToT fluctuations 
and changes than developed countries.
38World economic reports confirm that sharp and 
continuous declines in international commodity 
prices from 2011 to 2016 led to substantial shifts 
in the ToT and a sharp deterioration of GDP 
growth in commodity-dependent countries.
39 Of course, the extent to which a variation in the 
export or import price of a commodity affects 
the ToT will depend on the relative share of the 
commodity in the country™s total exports and 
imports, as well as on the magnitude of the price 
shock. Similar variations in export and import 
prices may also offset one another.
| 68 |Most fuel and mineral exporters (e.g. Congo, 
 Gabon, Nigeria, Zambia) witnessed a 
deterioration of their ToT as a result of the price 
declines between April 2011 and August 2015.
40 This, combined with the depreciation in their 
exchange rates and a loss of commodity revenue, 
led to deteriorations in the fiscal stance and 
stung GDP growth.
Studies also show that commodity price 
volatility can result in less economic growth, 
even over longer periods of time, especially in 
resource-rich, commodity-export-dependent 
countries.
41 This is because the ToT of 
economies dependent on primary commodities 
tend to deteriorate in the long run due to 
secular decline in primary commodities 
relative to prices of manufactured goods. 
Therefore, reliance on commodity exports 
that lose value over time is not such a viable 
strategy for boosting economic growth
42 Œ let 
alone for eliminating external vulnerability 
through diversification.
Shocks transmitted from ToT through 
the economy are also challenging to 
government budgets. In many low-income 
commodity-dependent countries, especially 
commodity-export-dependent countries, sharp 
declines and persisting low prices in the main 
export commodities can drain not only export 
revenues but also fiscal revenues.

2011 led to a deterioration in public finances 
for many commodity-export-dependent 
countries (oil and non-oil exporters) in Asia, 
Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, 
and in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
For example, public revenues of African 
commodity-dependent countries shrank 
from an average of 26 percent of GDP during 
2004˚2007 to 21˜percent of GDP in 2011˚2014. 
This partially explains why these countries™ 
average primary budget balances went from 
a surplus of 3.6˜percent of GDP to a deficit of 
1.8˜percent of GDP between the two periods. 
In response, many commodity-dependent 
countries increased their borrowing in order to 
shore up their finances.
43Such deteriorations in the fiscal stance may 
threaten the continuity of social programmes, 
safety nets, and other components of economic 
and social development plans. Food access can 
be negatively affected owing to governments™ 
more limited fiscal space to protect poor 
households against rising domestic prices. 
Generally, lower foreign exchange could 
also affect food availability through reduced 
food-import capacity. Contingency mechanisms 
and funds are critical to prevent these 
vulnerabilities from potentially harming food 
security, as further explained in Section 2.4.
Commodity-dependent countries that face 
such reductions in fiscal revenues in the 
wake of low or declining commodity prices 
may need to increase borrowing to cover 
shortfalls, thus leading to increasing public 
debt, which in turn can further compromise 
long-term growth and development, and 
lead to higher debt-repayment schedules. 
For instance, many South American 
commodity exporters have seen sharp 
increases in fiscal deficits that resulted in 
higher public debt-to-GDP ratios.
44Exchange rate adjustment and balance  of payments Commodity prices affect the amount of foreign 
exchange in commodity-dependent countries, 
as they alter the value of exports and imports 
in foreign currency. The balance of payments 
records these economic transactions.
A change in the foreign exchange available to 
an economy will be reflected in the price of 
foreign goods relative to the price of domestic 
goods, or real exchange rate. A net inflow/net 
outflow of foreign exchange will thus result 
in an appreciation/depreciation of the real 
exchange rate Œ other things being equal. By this 
definition, both the ToT and the real exchange 
rate may be affected simultaneously.
When countries™ reserves of foreign exchange are 
insufficient to prevent unfavourable exchange 
rate adjustments, they may adjust the number 
of units of their currency that are needed to 
purchase a unit of a given foreign currency 
or nominal exchange rate, so as to restore 
the balance of payments. Lower commodity 
prices, for example, may lead to a decrease 
of foreign exchange in the markets of the 
commodity-exporting countries as their export 
revenues fall, thus causing a real exchange 
rate depreciation. Countries that possess a 
domestic currency may devalue it to restore 
the income of their exporters in local currency. 
Depreciation and devaluation of currencies may 
pass through the system resulting in domestic 
price increases.
In Colombia and Chile, for example, falling 
international prices for the countries™ export 
commodities Œ respectively crude oil and copper 
Œ led to reduced export earnings and declining 
reserves in United States dollars (USD), triggering 
a devaluation of the local currency against USD 
(Figure 30
). Conditional on international price 
developments for agricultural commodities, this 
can imply more expensive food imports, reduced 
domestic food availability, and rising food prices.
For many commodity-dependent countries that 
experienced an increase in undernourishment or 
worsening food crises, the decline in commodity 
prices from 2011 to 2016 is associated with 
significant depreciations. This was especially the 
case for many commodity-dependent countries 
in Africa. For example, in 2015 many currencies 
including the Zambian kwacha, the Angolan 
kwanza and the Nigerian naira, recorded some 
of their strongest depreciations against USD 
in several years.
45 This pushed up the prices of 
non-commodity imports, further amplifying the 
sharp deterioration in their terms of trade. 
| 70 |Rising domestic prices, including foodInternational commodity price fluctuations 
can also transmit effects into the economy 
through exchange rate adjustments (
Figure 29
). 
Large depreciations are associated with domestic 
price increases and large devaluations tend to 
be associated with large declines in output, 
consumption and imports.
46 The pass-through 
of international commodity price developments 
to local domestic prices varies by commodity, 
country and over time.
47 Nonetheless, it can be 
particularly challenging for food security and 
nutrition, as it can affect people™s access to food, 
care and feeding, as well as access to health 
services Œ unless exceptional conditions prevail 
to offset these effects, as seems to have been the 
case during the global food and financial crises 
(Box 10
). 
As highlighted above, declining commodity 
prices may result in depreciation and 
devaluation of currencies that may pass 
through the system resulting in domestic price 
increases, including food prices. An alternative 
situation may be that food imports become 
more expensive owing to rising international 
commodity prices, with domestic food 
prices following suit. Both situations can be 
particularly challenging to net food importers. 
While the degree and speed of pass-through 
depends on the country in either of these two 
situations, the effect of higher food prices 
will flow through the food value chain from 
wholesale to retail prices. This poses a challenge 
to food security and nutrition if the country 
has limited capacity to substitute food imports 
with domestically produced food, and it is not 
obvious that all domestic food producers will 
benefit from higher food prices.
South Sudan™s currency devaluations in 2015, 
 for example, immediately triggered significant 
food price inflation and eroded purchasing 
power of a majority of the country™s poor and 
vulnerable. In cases like this, devaluation 
usually raises imported food prices and shifts

| 71 |the food parity price (the ruralŒurban terms of 
trade) in favour of agriculture/local produce. 
However, insignificant tradeable surplus by most 
farmers (due to low agricultural productivity), 
coupled with low levels of market integration 
and linkages, may exclude a number of farming 
populations from benefiting from rising prices of 
locally produced commodities. This was the chain 
of events in South Sudan, which led to increased 
levels of acute food insecurity and malnutrition 
levels, as populations struggled to access food 
Œ particularly troubling, given that 43 percent 
of the population of South Sudan are market 
dependent for their food needs.
48In these situations, households that need to 
buy food are immediately affected by higher 
domestic retail prices as the cost of food relative 
to their incomes increases (
Box 12
). While this is 
clearly the case in urban areas, it holds in rural 
settings as well. Even farmers, labourers or rural 
landowners, who are involved in agricultural 
activities, can be net food buyers and negatively 
affected by higher prices. Moreover, when 
rural incomes are strongly interlinked through 
multiplier effects,
49 food price drawbacks might 
spill over to net food sellers and leave even 
them worse off.
50 However, once transmitted 
to producers, higher food prices also stimulate 
agricultural production. In the medium term, 
they can thus work to the benefit of the 
rural community by increasing agricultural 
employment and generating opportunities to 
 earn an income up the value chain. However, 
 the example of South Sudan shows that when 
agricultural productivity and market integration 
are low, a number of farming populations 
may not benefit from rising prices of locally 
produced food.
Food prices play a key role also for dietary 
diversity. Even for smallholder farmers who cover 
most of their dietary energy from subsistence 
production, purchased foods can critically 
contribute to the variety and quality of their 
diets.
51 Costs tend to rise with dietary quality,
52 and a common strategy for coping with reduced 
purchasing power is to shift dietary patterns 
towards cheaper food. As a result, nutrient intake 
is compromised in the wake of surging prices. 
This coping strategy seems to have been used 
during the global food crisis (
Box 10
).A complex interplay between the nature 
and magnitude of food price changes, 
food availability, and the nutrient content 
of substitutes will determine the impact 
of rising prices on nutrition. The effect 
does not, however, take place uniformly. 
Households in low-income countries are prone 
to being disproportionately affected
53 as are 
urban households
54
 and women and children.
55 Whereas the influence of food price increases 
on nutrition through quality substitution is 
immediate, less direct channels are seen in 
the long term. For example, limiting health 
expenditure to save money for food can lead to 
more frequent, prolonged or more severe illness. 
This has negative implications for the body™s 
uptake of essential nutrients.
56Unemployment and loss of income and wagesWorld and domestic price adjustments, such 
as those described so far, bring about complex 
responses in the real economy. These responses 
from the supply and aggregate-demand 
sides will generate a number of ﬁquantityﬂ 
adjustments, including in employment and 
other areas, that can in turn trigger additional 
economy-wide effects, including in domestic 
prices and income. 
For commodity-dependent countries, sluggish 
economic activity as a result of falling commodity 
prices can lead to unemployment, loss of wages 
and, consequently, loss of incomes (
Figure 29
).57 And unemployment and loss of income are 
significantly related to food insecurity for the 
general population.
58For example, the declining economic and 
negative growth observed in Latin America and 
the Caribbean during 2012Œ2016 was largely 
associated with marked declines in commodity 
prices, mainly affecting South America.
59 The urban unemployment rate reached 
8.9 percent in 2016, representing an increase of 
1.6 percentage points from 2015. The declining 
GDP and the rise in unemployment resulted 
in lower wages or other forms of household 
incomes. After several years of marked 
reductions in poverty, the number of poor 
people rose from 166 million to 175 million 
between 2013 and 2015, increasing from 
28.1˜percent to 29.2 percent of the population.

Counting the beans: the true cost of a plate of food around the world
. Rome.
BOX 12ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND THE COST OF BASIC FOOD IN COLOMBIAThe case of Colombia illustrates the effects of an 
economic slowdown on the affordability of food via 
the described transmission channels. 
Falling international prices for Colombia™s export 
commodities, particularly crude oil, led to reduced 
export earnings and declining reserves in United 
States dollars, triggering a devaluation of the 
Colombian peso (COP) against the United States 
dollar (USD) Œ see Figure 30. Between 2012 and 2017, GDP per capita growth 
plummeted, along with significant current account 
imbalances and local currency depreciation. At the 
same time, household income stayed put when 
expressed in real terms, while inflation rose steadily up 
to 2016 (see table below).To make the impact of this economic slowdown on 
the affordability of food more tangible, it is helpful to 
look at the cost of a basic plate of food; for example, 
through the ﬁCounting the beansﬂ index developed by 
WFP, which provides a cross-country comparison of 
a stew made of beans or other pulses, paired with a 
carbohydrate staple that matches local preferences.1 The building block of the index is the meal-to-income 
ratio, which is the cost of a stew of beans as a share 
of daily earnings. The effect of the economic slowdown 
on the affordability of food is obvious in the Colombian 
case: in 2016, every Colombian had to allocate on 
average three percent of their daily income to afford 
such a basic plate of food, which is more than the 
yearly allocation in the 2012Œ2015 period. 
| 73 |The pass-through effects on unemployment 
and income will vary from country to country 
depending on what sectors are producing the 
primary commodities upon which the country is 
dependent. For example, the oil and diamonds 
sectors typically create little employment 
and are weakly linked with the rest of the 
economy. On the other hand, in agriculture, 
particularly where export crops are grown by 
smallholder producers, the impacts can be more 
widely spread.
Sharp and declining commodity prices may, 
through reduced incomes, force households to 
adopt coping strategies that do not necessarily 
improve food security and nutrition. 
Agricultural employment and smallholder  food producersThe impacts of economic slowdowns and 
downturns can be felt particularly hard in 
agriculture, both because of what happens 
within the sector and because of urbanŒrural 
linkages. These impacts can be especially 
harmful to countries lagging behind in terms of 
economic development and transformation.
The levels of structural and rural transformation 
of the economies (i.e. the relative levels of 
dependence on agriculture, degree of 
agricultural and non-farm diversification, 
commercialization and productivity), will 
determine the extent to which economies are 
capable of coping with the challenges. 
The extent to which ruralŒurban linkages 
weaken as the economy deteriorates will 
determine the impacts on agricultural and 
rural off-farm employment and the welfare of 
smallholder food producers. 
The impacts on agriculture can be particularly 
significant in low-income countries. 
The agricultural sector accounts for substantial 
shares of employment and output in these 
countries. In 2017, agricultural employment 
accounted for 68 percent of total employment, 
and agricultural output accounted for about 
26 percent of GDP in low-income countries.
60
More generally, as employment, wages and 
household income fall, particularly in urban 
areas, there will likely be less demand for 
agricultural production from rural areas.
61 Shrinking employment opportunities, including 
those for rural migrants, result in lower 
remittances from urban areas and more limited 
farm investments in rural space. 
Among the four dimensions of food security 
Œ availability, access, utilization and stability Œ 
access is the principal channel between economic 
shocks and food security and nutrition, mainly 
through two pillars of availability (supply 
through the market or home-production) and 
affordability (household income from farm and 
non-farm activities), both of which are directly 
related to agricultural income and non-farm 
employment.
62
 Downturns and price volatility can significantly 
undermine the livelihoods and income of 
small-scale food producers, agricultural 
labourers and the rural poor, in particular those 
who are net food buyers, forcing them to reduce 
their consumption in quantity and quality.
63 Conversely, in some circumstances price spikes 
might be beneficial for farmers, as, due to 
increased prices, they have a higher incentive 
to produce crops. Often, food producers 
cope with the impacts of economic shocks by 
focusing their production and consumption of 
food on staple crops. While doing so allows 
them to sustain dietary energy intake, it might 
lead to a deterioration, in dietary diversity. 
In other words, improving their productivity 
and the availability of cash income along with 
nutrition-sensitive behavioural change are 
critical for them to access higher quality and 
more diversified diets. Broad-based income 
growth, grounded on a diversified set of 
economic activities, including off-farm 
activities, can bring shifts in nutrition towards 
balanced dietary patterns. 
The impacts of economic slowdowns on food 
security and nutrition are demonstrated in 
Haiti, Nepal and the Niger. Amid a global 
financial crisis coupled with high food prices, 
households™ food security, as measured by 
dietary diversity, reduced by 5 percent in Nepal, 
8 percent in the Niger, and 23 percent in Haiti 
due to increased food prices.
64 In the Indian 
Himalayas, economic slowdown coupled with 
natural resource depletion and climate change 
  »| 74 |negatively impacted on food production and 
employment opportunities. This resulted in 
increased threats to food security due to lower 
purchasing power.
65 Recent research on the effects of export-led 
agricultural growth on agricultural labour 
shows that high-value export sectors 
create formal employment opportunities 
in rural areas and can transform the 
low-productivity smallholder based labour 
market into a high-productivity modern 
agro-industrial sector, thereby fostering rural 
transformation.
66 When the agro-industry and 
the smallholder sector are spatially close to 
each other, direct investment and consumption 
linkages can lead to increased incomes and 
non-farm employment,
67 which improve 
household capacity to deal with risks Œ 
including those caused by economic slowdowns 
and downturns. The ultimate effects of 
slowdowns and downturns on households 
depend on whether they are global, regional 
or national. Whereas a global downturn may 
stall the overall rural transformation process 
by setting back the direct and spillover effects 
of export sectors on labour markets (and hence 
livelihoods), a regional or national economic 
slowdown or downturn could potentially be 
weathered if countries are sufficiently open to 
international trade.
68
Health and social intersectoral effects 
Cuts to health and social sector spending 
precipitated by economic slowdowns or 
downturns can have negative impacts on 
food security and nutrition, particularly in 
high commodity-dependent countries with 
potentially lifelong and intergenerational 
implications for health and development 
(Figure 29
). 
Social sector expenditure Œ comprising health, 
education and welfare/social protection 
spending Œ are core pillars for promoting 
health, well-being and health equity in current 
and future generations.
69 Within the health 
sector, the universal health coverage (UHC) 
approach has demonstrated positive impacts on 
population health and health equity.
70 Similarly, 
education and social welfare policies have 
demonstrable impacts on health and well-being 
through nutrition pathways such as improved 
feeding practices.
71 By ensuring universal health coverage and 
providing social safety nets, government 
spending on these essential services contribute 
to poverty reduction and improving population 
health, which in turn reinforce food security 
and nutrition.
72 However, economic slowdowns 
and downturns caused by unfavourable 
commodity price shocks can drain fiscal revenues 
and have implications for public budgets in 
commodity-dependent countries, which are not 
all in a position to counteract these changes.
Cuts in health spending could affect nutrition 
through reduced provision of, or access to, 
quality essential services for infant, young 
child and maternal nutrition mainly delivered 
through the health system. Reductions in 
other areas of social spending could impact 
directly or indirectly on nutrition due to a 
deteriorating health environment, increasing the 
risk of infectious diseases that can exacerbate 
malnutrition, or due to reduced provisions for 
social protection such as school feeding, cash or 
food vouchers. 
Despite the global recession and slow economic 
growth experienced over the past decade, it has 
been observed that government fiscal capacity, 
as measured by the share of overall government 
spending in GDP, had grown across all groups 
of countries.
73 However, allocations from fiscal 
space to essential social expenditure overall have 
been under pressure since 2010, after an initial 
period of expansion following the economic crisis 
of 2008Œ2009.
74 Public health expenditure as a percentage of 
total government expenditure, while increasing 
in some country groupings, has decreased in 
low-income countries overall from 7.9 percent 
in 2000 to 6.8 percent in 2016. In high 
commodity-dependent countries, the decrease 
has been even greater.
75 Health expenditure as 
a percentage of total government expenditure 
in high commodity-dependent countries 
during the 2008Œ2015 period contracted by 
1.3 percent for low-income countries (compared 
with an increase for this specific period in 
other low-income countries), by 0.6 percentage

Table 10
). 
Decreased public health expenditure coupled 
with low rates of expenditure and reductions in 
other essential social expenditure have health 
repercussions through impaired food security 
and nutrition and other impact pathways, in 
particular for poorer populations. 
Reduced health spending affects the quality 
and effectiveness of health services, for example 
through less frequent service provision, 
shortages of medication and equipment or 
supplies, and reduced staff numbers and lower 
staff morale. This can impact nutrition directly 
through reduced micronutrient supplementation, 
breastfeeding support and other essential 
nutrition actions for mothers, infants and young 
children; and indirectly through reduced services 
affecting family planning, antenatal care and 
interventions to prevent or control infectious 
diseases or diet-related non-communicable 
diseases.
76 During economic crises, populations 
tend to switch from private to public services, 
when funding and services are already under 
pressure.
77 Moreover, user fees are often 
introduced or increased, which can lead to delays 
in seeking health care and ultimately to poorer 
health outcomes.
78 These user fees can also 
drive people into poverty,
79
 limiting household 
budgets for needed food. 
Similarly, reduced government budgets 
can affect other important social 
expenditures, including for education 
(Table 10
). Education expenditures for high 
commodity-dependent countries decreased as 
a percentage of total government expenditure 
between 2008 and 2015 Œ by 0.3 percentage 
points and 2.0 percentage points in low-income 
and lower-middle-income countries, respectively. 
Reduced education expenditures is a problem in 
its own right, but it also means less investment 
in school infrastructure relevant to health, 
such as for safe water and sanitation, which 
affects the risk of infectious disease,
80 such as 
diarrhoea, and can exacerbate or be exacerbated 
by undernutrition.
81 Governments also struggle 
to maintain social protection measures during 
economic slowdowns and downturns, including 
cash and food transfers, food vouchers and 
school meals, which are particularly important 
for food security and nutrition.
82 In addition, the ways in which families have 
to cope with economic crises can impact infant 
and young childcare, including breastfeeding 
practices. Economic pressures on mothers to 
work soon after childbirth can reduce their 
ability to exclusively breastfeed for six months, 
while pressures on government budgets and 
private sector employers may undermine 
maternity provision. Resource constraints can 
also compromise caregivers™ ability to provide 
optimal care to infants and young children due 
to increased workload, time pressures or poor 
health.
83 How households cope and when they fail Households facing a reduction in purchasing 
power as a result of economic events have to look 
for ways to cope with these shocks to maintain 
food security and consumption to the extent 
possible (
Figure 29
). 
Due to their economy-wide nature, economic 
slowdowns and downturns pose macroeconomic 
aggregate shocks affecting multiple households, 
which are different from idiosyncratic shocks 
that affect only a single household, such as the 
illness of a household member. This means that 
many coping strategies that are used during 
idiosyncratic shocks are ineffective in the face of 
such aggregate shocks.
84˜During economic slowdowns and downturns, 
wages can decline and jobs might be more 
difficult to find, and consequently households 
losing their employment might have to take up 
lower paying jobs, often in the informal sector. 
In such circumstances, household members 
normally not involved in salaried activities Œ 
 for example, women and younger members still 
in school Œ might need to look for employment. 
Households may also try to make use of any 
savings or insurance mechanism at their disposal 
(Table 11
). 
However, with increased prices, savings will buy 
less food than before. Households might find it 
more difficult to borrow from family members or 
access informal insurance groups such as village 
funds, if many households are facing economic

| 78 |difficulties at the same time. Also, public 
spending on safety nets might decrease during 
economic slowdowns, thereby leaving behind 
many households in need.
85 One coping strategy which has been shown in 
some countries to work well in times of economic 
slowdowns and downturns is return migration to 
the village of origin. As food prices rise, farmers 
benefit from the labour supply of returned 
migrants and from increased agricultural 
production, enabling them to better cope with 
job losses and reduced remittances of affected 
migrants.
86 Alternatively, workers might seek job 
opportunities in other countries, thus increasing 
the inflow of remittances. 
While the availability of coping strategies is 
restricted for households in general, coping 
is particularly challenging for vulnerable 
households, as they are endowed with fewer 
assets to deplete and often have weaker social 
networks for support. They are more often forced 
to take up coping strategies that help in the 
short term while jeopardizing future earning 
possibilities and the human capital of the 
household, such as taking children out of school, 
possibly leading them into an intergenerational 
poverty trap.
87 For example, they may have to sell assets 
that are essential for their livelihood, such 
as the last female animals in their livestock, 
productive tools or seeds, or they may be forced 
to incur too much debt. The need to change 
consumption patterns can lead to reduced 
spending on education and health, or shifts in 
nutrition away from nutrient-rich foods, such 
as vegetables or meat, towards more starchy 
foods. While securing access to sufficient dietary 
energy in the short term, this behaviour will have 
negative long-term effects on people™s nutrition 
and health and human capital
88 as seen during 
the global food crisis (

). 
 2.3
  NEXUS BETWEEN 
ECONOMIC GROWTH, 
POVERTY, AND FOOD 
SECURITY AND 
NUTRITION: THE ROLE 
 OF INEQUALITY KEY MESSAGES 
 Economic events will ultimately affect food security 
and nutrition, depending on extreme poverty levels 
and the extent to which the poor face exclusion due to 
different inequalities. However, outcomes may vary 
from country to country.
 While extreme poverty is one of the underlying 
causes of food insecurity and malnutrition, 
food-insecure and malnourished people are not 
always members of the poorest households. Most of 
the hungry and undernourished populations today live 
in middle-income countries. 
 Inequalities are one of the myriad reasons why 
extreme poverty reduction does not necessarily 
translate into improved food security and nutrition. 
Socially excluded and marginalized groups are at 
increased risk of food insecurity, unhealthy diets, 
malnutrition in all its forms and poor health outcomes.
 Income inequality is rising in several low- and 
middle-income countries. Inequalities are also seen in 
accessing basic services and assets, between and 
within households. All of this is making it more difficult 
for poor and marginalized groups to benefit from 
economic growth.
 Inequalities not only prevent the most 
food-insecure and malnourished people from being 
helped by economic growth; they also make these 
people more vulnerable in the face of economic 
slowdowns and downturns.
| 79 |Poverty and socio-economic inequalities  also matterEconomic slowdowns and downturns generate a 
number of direct and indirect impacts that flow 
through different transmission channels and 
challenge food security and nutrition. Many of 
these impacts can be generalized. They are 
transmitted through prices and economy-wide 
responses that would behave in a similar manner 
in most low- and middle-income countries. 
Declining commodity prices trigger unambiguous 
economic effects in high commodity-dependent 
countries with implications for food security 
and nutrition. 
The final impact on food security and nutrition, 
however, depends on how many poor people 
live in the country and the extent to which they 
face exclusion due to inequalities. On the one 
hand, economic slowdowns and downturns 
tend to be correlated with increases in poverty 
and inequality. On the other hand, poverty, 
inequalities and marginalization are some of the 
underlying causes of hunger and malnutrition in 
all its forms. But the relationships between these 
factors are not so simple, for a number of reasons.
First, it is not always true that robust economic 
growth helps to reduce poverty and improve 
food security and nutrition.
89 Economic growth, 
although necessary, may not be sufficient 
to ensure poverty reduction, food security 
and nutrition. Many countries have achieved 
economic growth, but show poor records in terms 
of poverty alleviation
90 and improvements in food 
security and nutrition. 
Second, poverty, food security and nutrition do 
not always move in unison. Countries can achieve 
robust economic growth and poverty reduction, 
but this does not always translate into improved 
food security and nutrition. The disconnect 
has become even more apparent recently, as 
many countries have made significant progress 
in reducing poverty but not in improving food 
security and nutrition indicators.
91 Third, when poverty reduction does result in 
increased food security, this does not necessarily 
mean nutritional status will be improved as 
well. Poverty and food insecurity is only weakly 
linked with malnutrition, and there may be 
other factors at play. For example, stunting 
in children is not only related to the quality 
of diet, but also to hygiene, health care and 
maternal nutrition during pregnancy, among 
others. High-quality foods might not be evenly 
distributed among household members or 
households may not have access to adequate 
sanitation, safe drinking water and health care.
The next section explores the nexus between 
economic growth, poverty,
92 and food security 
and nutrition. In doing so, it looks at the central 
role of inequality in shaping the outcomes 
of food security and nutrition in this nexus. 
Understanding the relationships is critical 
if countries are to design targeted policies 
and programmes to address food insecurity 
and malnutrition. 
A key feature of the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development is the recognition 
of the interconnectedness between the SDGs. 
Ignoring the nexus between economic growth, 
poverty, food security and nutrition, and the role 
inequalities play within this nexus, could push 
policies and programmes designed to end hunger 
and malnutrition to miss their mark and fail. 
Rooting out hunger and malnutrition in all its 
forms will require an integrated understanding to 
inform solutions that are not exclusively relevant 
for SDG 2 (ending hunger and malnutrition in 
all its forms) but also other SDGs, particularly 
Œ albeit not exclusively Œ SDG 1 (ending poverty 
in all of its manifestations),
93 SDG 8 (promoting 
inclusive and sustainable economic growth), and 
SDG 10 (reducing inequalities). 
Disentangling the nexus To better understand the nexus between 
economic growth, poverty, and food security 
and nutrition, it is important to recognize 
that these are multidimensional concepts 
that are multidirectional in their relationship 
to one another (e.g. hunger is a result of 
poverty, but hunger itself is a cause of 
poverty). Evidence also indicates that stunting 
contributes to intergenerational transmission of 
poverty and deprivation, which often explains 
intergenerational effects on linear growth of 
children.
94| 80 |Poverty, food security and nutrition are 
interrelated, but they are also distinct from one 
another.
95 They often move together, but they 
are also different and have unique determinants, 
so they are not always correlated. For example, 
poverty can be on the decline, while progress 
in reducing food insecurity and malnutrition 
stagnates or even reverses course. 
Unpacking the nexus between economic growth, 
poverty, food security and nutrition is complex. 
Therefore, this section will look at three separate 
linkages and relationships. First, evidence on 
the links between economic growth and poverty 
reduction will be reviewed, followed by the links 
between economic growth and food security and 
nutrition, and then the links between poverty 
and food security and nutrition.
Economic growth and poverty reduction
Sustained economic growth is one of the 
most critical factors in alleviating poverty. 
Numerous cross-country studies and statistical 
evidence confirm that the main determinant 
of poverty reduction is the pace of economic 
growth.
96 There is clear evidence for the positive 
association, but the magnitude or strength of the 
effect varies across countries. 
For example, one study found that growth in 
average incomes as measured by GDP per capita 
explained approximately half of the variations 
in short-run changes of poverty level.
97
 Another 
study on 14 countries between 1990 and 2003 
found that a one percent increase in GDP per 
capita reduced poverty by 1.7 percent.
98 For some 
countries such as Viet Nam, the reduction was 
spectacular Œ a halving of the poverty rate from 
58 percent to 29 percent, or almost 8 percent 
a year. Poverty rates have declined between 
3 percent and 6 percent per year in El Salvador, 
Ghana, India, Tunisia and Uganda.
World price shocks and macroeconomic 
adjustments affecting economic growth directly, 
such as those described in Section 2.2, can 
potentially affect poverty. For countries with 
high primary commodity dependence, the 
degree of macroeconomic stability, in particular 
avoiding inflationary shocks, is a critical factor. 
The sectoral composition of economic growth 
can also explain in some cases why given rates 
of economic growth can lead to different rates of 
poverty reduction. 
The rate at which poverty shrinks as growth 
accelerates differs from country to country, 
given the initial level of income inequality in 
the country and changes in income inequality 
over time.
99 For example, Senegal and Burkina 
Faso had similar levels of economic growth Œ 
2.2 percent per capita per year Œ over a similar 
timeframe.
100
 But poverty declined by 2.5 percent 
annually in Senegal and by just 1.8 percent 
in Burkina Faso. Senegal made more progress 
because it had less inequality as a result of 
pro-poor growth policies introduced in the 1990s. 
Another study found that for countries where 
income inequality was very high, a 1 percent 
increase in average household income levels had 
a much lower impact on poverty (0.6 percent 
reduction) than it did in countries where 
inequality was low (4.3 percent).
101
 By comparison, between 2001 and 2017, Mali 
experienced limited economic growth with an 
average GDP per capita growth of 1.9 percent.
102
 However, the country still made significant 
strides in reducing poverty and improving social 
indicators. An important part of Mali™s success 
in poverty reduction can be attributed to its 
remarkable performance in reducing inequality. 
The country™s Gini coefficient has fallen from 
39.9 in 2001 to 33 in 2011, making Mali™s growth 
performance an inclusive one. More importantly, 
calculations by the World Bank
103
 show that 
82 percent of the poverty reduction performance 
of the country between 2001 and 2010 can be 
attributed to better distribution of consumption 
among households Œ the remaining 18˜percent 
seems to be mostly explained by the average 
increase in consumption. Of course, these gains 
have been threatened by the conflict in the 
country that erupted in 2012. 
In addition to the initial level of income inequality, 
the pattern of economic growth and different 
initial conditions in human development reflecting 
a number of other inequalities beyond income also 
factor in to determine whether economic growth 
translates into poverty reduction (
Box 13
).Income inequality can also reduce the impact of 
future economic growth on poverty reduction.

.China and India have enjoyed significant economic 
growth in recent years. Between 1990 and 2017, the 
two countries had an average GDP per capita growth 
rate of 8.6 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively.
1 However, the effects of growth within each country 
have been different.The figure below shows that in both countries the 
increase in GDP per capita has been accompanied 
by poverty reduction. China™s poverty rate declined 
from 88 percent in 1981 to 0.7 percent in 2015. 
In comparison, India™s poverty reduction seems 
relatively more modest1 ˜ moving from 48.9 percent in 
1987 to 21.2 percent in 2011, or to 13.4˚percent in 
2015 if another World Bank source is used.
2 For the 
period 1999Œ2005, the income elasticity of poverty 
in China was estimated at 1.51. This means that a 
1 percent increase in GDP per capita was associated 
with poverty reduction rates of 1.51 percent. During the 
same period, India had an income elasticity of poverty 
of only 0.4.Regarding hunger and malnutrition, the PoU 
decreased from 15.9 percent in 2002Œ2004 to 
8.8 percent in 2015Œ2017 in China, compared 
with a decrease from 22.2 percent in 2002Œ2004 
to 14.8 percent in 2015Œ2017 in India. Stunting in 
children under five years of age fell from 17.8 percent 
in 2000 to 8.1 percent in 2013 in China. In India, it 
fell from 54.2˚percent to 38.4 percent between 2000 
and 2015, which is still a high prevalence, compared 
with a global average of 23.2 percent in 2015.1, 3The unique growth patterns and inequality levels 
in each country may help explain the differences 
observed in the countries in terms of poverty and food 
security and nutrition trends: 
| 82 |BOX 13(CONTINUED)a. The pattern of economic growth in China, 
especially in the 1980s, shows that the primary 
sector, where most of the poor derive their 
livelihoods, was one of the most dynamic 
sectors behind GDP growth. On the other hand, 
in India the rate of growth has been higher 
in the industrial and services sectors than in 
agriculture.
4b. The responsiveness of poverty reduction to 
growth is generally higher when initial inequality 
is lower. This seems to have been the case for 
income inequality in China, where in 1983 the 
Gini coefficient was 28.3. In India, the Gini 
coefficient that year was 31.5.
5 At the same time, 
land was much more equally allocated in China 
than in India during the 1980s.
6 Furthermore, 
the Gini coefficient for urban and rural areas in 
1983Œ84 was 24.7 and 18.5, respectively, in 
China, compared with 30.0 in urban areas and 
33.3 in rural areas in India.
7 c. Finally, different initial conditions in human 
development also played an important role. 
Health and education standards were much 
better in China in the 1980s than they were in 
India.
8 In 1980, China had 2.2 hospital beds 
per 1 000 people compared with 0.8 in India. 
This number increased to 3.8 in 2011, while it 
decreased to 0.7 in India. Differences in literacy 
rates were also important. Only in 2011 India 
was able to reach the levels of literacy that 
China had in 1982, amounting to more than 
65 percent.

| 83 |One study found that a fall in income inequality, 
as measured by the Gini coefficient from 
0.55 to 0.45, would cause poverty to drop by 
more than 15 percentage points in ten years. 
However, it would take 30 years to achieve the 
same reduction in poverty if inequality remained 
unchanged.
105
 Economic growth, food security and nutrition The relationship between economic growth 
and food security and nutrition has important 
policy implications. These involve pro-poor 
growth strategies to reduce hunger and child 
malnutrition, as well as the need for direct 
food security and nutritional investments. 
By extension, the implications also affect how 
limited financial resources are competitively 
allocated between different types of investments.
How does economic growth contribute  to nutrition? The relationship between increased national 
income (GDP per capita) and nutrition works 
through two complementary channels. 
When economic growth stimulates average 
incomes, populations may spend a larger part 
of their incomes on healthy, nutrition-relevant 
goods and services. Increased GDP may also 
boost state provision of nutrition-relevant 
services as well as social and health 
infrastructure Œ if governments use newly 
generated tax revenues to invest in them. 
The role of economic growth in reducing 
child undernutrition remains a highly 
debated issue. For example, there is extensive 
empirical evidence that economic growth and 
child stunting are negatively correlated (i.e. 
the higher the economic growth, the lower 
the child stunting). However, evidence on the 
magnitude of this relationship varies across 
studies.
106
 One study finds a prominent role for 
economic growth, in which a 10 percent increase 
in GDP per capita would lead to a 6 percent 
reduction in child stunting prevalence.
107
  While this is in line with the findings of several 
studies,
108
 others find that child stunting 
would be decreased even more, for example 
by 7.3 percent.
109
 In contrast, still others find 
the relationship to be much weaker or even 
nonexistent.
110
 The relationships between economic growth 
and child stunting can also differ by region. 
For example, cross-country time series data 
suggest that the relationship is weaker in 
sub-Saharan Africa than in other regions.
111 For Africa as a whole, other variables such as 
maternal education, socio-economic status and 
poor maternal nutrition are more important in 
explaining the slow progress in reducing child 
undernutrition.
112
Not only can economic growth affect child 
stunting, but the reverse may occur.
113
 A new 
study finds that a 10 percent increase in GDP 
per capita would reduce stunting prevalence 
by 2.7 percent. However, the reverse causality 
impacts of stunting on current growth estimate 
that a one percentage point increase in stunting 
prevalence would result in a 0.4 percent 
decrease in current GDP per capita. The study™s 
back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that 
stunting costs on average about 13.5 percent of 
GDP per capita in developing countries.
114
  If these recent findings on the negative reverse 
causality are correct, it implies that the results of 
earlier studies could be biased downwards and 
overstate the actual impact of economic growth 
towards child stunting reductions. 
Despite the debate on the magnitude of 
effects, it is clear that while economic growth 
contributes to improvements in child nutrition, 
it does so only modestly and is not sufficient in 
many settings to accelerate reductions in child 
undernutrition. What matters most is addressing 
other causes of undernutrition, including 
access to nutritious foods for a healthy diet, 
improvement in women™s status and education, 
feeding and care practices and quality health 
services. This requires implementation of 
nutrition-specific policies and interventions with 
a focus on vulnerable populations, regardless of 
whether there is economic growth.
115
As for obesity and overweight, their relationship 
with economic growth is less clear-cut due to 
the paucity of research. However, evidence does 
suggest that the relationship varies depending on 
the income setting of the country. For example, 
a study using data from 175 countries found a 
positive relationship between body weight and 
GDP per capita growth. Seventy-two countries 
  »| 84 |where GDP was below USD˜3˜000 showed 
a significantly positive linear relationship 
between the body mass index (BMI) and GDP, 
whereas 102 countries where GDP was above 
USD˜3˜000 showed no significant relationship 
between the two.
116
 Clearly, income growth 
alone does not necessarily guarantee healthier 
diets and improved nutritional status; other 
policies, for example those that create healthy 
food environments and facilitate and promote 
physically active lives, among others, are 
also needed. 
How does economic growth contribute to  food security? There is even less empirical evidence on 
the links between economic growth and 
food security, partially due to the lack of 
common food-insecurity measures and data. 
Empirical analysis is increasingly common, 
however, given the development of the Food 
Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) by FAO 
and with the newly available FIES panel 
data (for more details about FIES see Part 1). 
Recent studies provide consistent results and 
an important first indication of the relationship, 
although evidence is not conclusive and more 
research is required.
The results generally confirm that with increases 
in economic growth, there are concurrent declines 
in severe food insecurity. However, similar to 
child stunting, the magnitude of this relationship 
varies across countries. In this case, it varies by 
income level and the degree of income inequality 
of the country.
117
 One recent study for Latin America and the 
Caribbean finds that a 10 percent increase in a 
country™s GDP per capita lowered the likelihood 
of moderate and severe food insecurity by 
11.5 percentage points and severe food insecurity 
by 9.7 percentage points.
118
 Another study of 
134 countries also finds the same negative 
relationship, but with much smaller effects and 
with statistically significant results only for 
 low- and high-income countries.
119
To complement these two studies, a new FAO 
analysis was conducted for this report, using 
newly available cross-country FIES panel data for 
75 low- and middle-income countries. The results 
reconfirmed a negative relationship between 
GDP per capita and severe food insecurity.
120
 An FAO analysis found that the relationship 
between GDP per capita and undernourishment 
(as measured by the prevalence) was also 
negative. However, it was highly nonlinear, 
meaning that the relationship became 
progressively weaker at higher levels of 
development. The most recent data show that the 
strength of the relationship decreases sharply up 
to USD˜2˜000 per capita in constant prices, which 
is within the lower-middle-income category 
(countries with income of USD˜996Œ3˜895 per 
capita). In other words, economic growth is more 
effective in reducing the PoU in low-income 
countries; as the level of a country™s GDP per 
capita rises, the effect weakens. Most of the 
world™s hungry, however, live in middle-income 
countries (see next section). So the potential 
contributions of economic growth to ending 
hunger are weaker than expected. 
Poverty reduction and food security and nutrition
It is commonly understood that poverty goes 
hand in hand with hunger and malnutrition. 
Poverty is indeed one of the underlying causes of 
food insecurity and malnutrition. However, they 
do not always move in unison, and in some cases 
they diverge from what is expected. Investigating 
why this is the case is critical for eradicating food 
insecurity and malnutrition.
The relationship between poverty, food 
security and nutrition is also bidirectional, 
meaning that food security and nutrition are 
both determinants and dimensions of poverty. 
Food insecurity, poor health and malnutrition 
are often reasons why households end up 
in poverty or sink further into it, if they are 
already poor.
121
One reason is that poverty, food insecurity 
and malnutrition are distinct and multifaceted 
phenomena.
122
 Not all people who are food 
insecure and malnourished necessarily live 
in the poorest households. This is especially 
so when the problems of food insecurity and 
malnutrition are greater. Additionally, poverty 
reduction may not necessarily translate into 
better food security and nutrition due to 
existing inequalities.
| 85 |By definition, extreme poverty is the lack 
of sufficient income to meet basic dietary 
needs. It affects the ability of individuals and 
households to access healthy, nutritious foods 
that constitute a healthy diet through purchase 
or production, and is linked to minimal or 
inadequate access to essential health services. 
The World Bank defines extreme poverty as 
living on less than USD 1.90 per day, which 
generally reflects the cost of enough dietary 
energy and other essentials to meet basic needs. 
This is a very low poverty threshold, as it is 
estimated based on the average of the national 
poverty lines of 15 very poor countries, adjusted 
for inflation using 2011 prices and taking into 
account differences in prices across countries 
(i.e. purchasing power parity Œ PPP). The main 
purpose is to help obtain a measure of extreme 
poverty comparable across countries. 
Higher levels of extreme poverty as defined by 
the World Bank are correlated with higher rates 
of undernourishment as measured by the PoU, 
and higher rates of child stunting at the country 
level, with the latter relationship being nonlinear 
(Figure 31
). The correlation coefficient between 
extreme poverty and undernourishment is 0.68, 
and it is 0.62 between extreme poverty and child 
stunting. This indicates a moderate-to-strong 
correlation between poverty and these two 
measures of food security and nutrition. 
Poverty explains around half of the observed 
variation in undernourishment and child stunting 
(i.e. R-squared of 0.50 and 0.57 for PoU and child 
stunting, respectively). However, there are also 
a number of countries where undernourishment 
and child stunting are higher than predicted 
by extreme poverty (countries above the line in 
Figure 31
) and countries that have lower levels than 
predicted by extreme poverty (countries below 
the line in 
Figure 31
).Beyond the absolute levels of income or poverty, 
variability of income is critical and is often one 
of the main causes of food insecurity.
123
 Income 
variability, even within the same year, can have a 
significant impact on food access. It is caused by 
a convergence of factors, such as weather-related 
shocks, that limit households™ ability to smooth 
consumption over time, rendering access 
to food, health and nutrition vulnerable to 
economic shocks.
In addition to income variability, access to food 
is also conditioned by people™s awareness and 
knowledge of food quality, as well as other 
factors that can cause significant differences 
when it comes to malnutrition among members 
of households at similar levels of poverty. 
Other factors include diverse consumption and 
intra-household distribution patterns, dietary 
habits, climate conditions and cultural factors.
124
 There is also an array of public policies that can 
significantly affect non-income-based access to 
food and utilization of food, and access to basic 
health and social services critical to nutrition, as 
outlined in the ICN2 Framework for Action.
125
 At the household level, there is clear evidence 
that low levels of household income and 
household wealth are associated with different 
forms of malnutrition. For example, the poorest 
children are 2.26 times more likely to be 
stunted than the richest children. However, the 
extent of the income inequality in stunting 
varies considerably. For example, there is an 
elevenfold difference between the richest and 
the poorest children in Peru, and more than 
fivefold differences in Bolivia (Plurinational 
State of), Gabon, Honduras and Jordan.
126
 Other multi-country studies confirm that 
stunting prevalence is higher in households 
with lower wealth and income.
127
 Country data 
from Cambodia,
128
 Colombia,
129
 India,
130
 and 
Pakistan
131
 find a similar pattern.
While the analysis of selected country microdata 
also confirms that higher levels of child 
stunting are found in the poorest households, 
it also shows that not all stunted children live 
in the poorest households. In some countries 
this number can be quite large (
Figure 32
). 
For example, a recent study of 30 countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa found that around 75 percent 
of underweight women and children were not 
in the poorest 20 percent of households, and 
around half were not in the poorest 40 percent of 
households.
132
 The study also found that a larger 
share of undernourished people are members 
of non-poor families in countries with a higher 
overall incidence of undernutrition.

| 87 |An important explanation of this finding is the 
existence of intra-household inequality, which is 
in line with evidence from a number of studies 
that find vulnerable individuals do not necessarily 
live in households that would normally be 
considered poor. As such, they are hidden from 
view in standard data sources on poverty.

 There are numerous studies that find that low 
socio-economic status is negatively associated

Poverty or 
food insecurity and malnutrition are linked, 
but food security is only one underlying cause 
of nutrition besides adequate care for children 
and women, and sufficient health services and 
a healthy environment. Therefore, the linkages 
between food insecurity and malnutrition may 
be weak. 
For example, high-quality foods might not 
be evenly distributed among household 
members, reflecting intra-household inequality. 
Households may not have access to basic 
services, such as adequate sanitation, safe 
drinking water and health care, which are 
critical underlying determinants of food security 
and nutrition. Adequate access to food and basic 
services often play a more important role in 
fighting hunger and delayed child growth and 
other forms of malnutrition, despite economic 
growth and income.
138
Evidence for the possible disconnect between 
poverty reduction and eradication of food 
insecurity and malnutrition has important policy 
implications, given that anti-poverty policies in 
developing countries often assume that targeting 
poor households will be reasonably effective in 
reaching those who are malnourished. From a 
policy perspective, the evidence suggests that 
targeting relatively poor households will tend to 
work less well than reaching vulnerable women 
and children in countries where the overall 
problem of malnutrition is greater. 
Furthermore, most of the hungry and 
undernourished people today do not live in the 
world™s poorest countries. In 2017, more than 
75 percent of the world™s hungry, 78 percent 
of the stunted children and 64 percent of the 
extreme poor lived in middle-income countries 
Œ and only in a handful of these countries.
139
 Although the highest rates of poverty, hunger 
and child stunting are typically found in 
low-income countries, they do not make a 
substantive contribution to the total number of 
extreme poor nor the hungry in the world.
The geographical distribution of the number 
of extreme poor, undernourished and stunted 
children also show a different pattern (
Figure 33
). 
The distribution of global extreme poverty has

Relationship between poverty, overweight 
 and obesityLike other indicators, in the case of overweight 
and obesity, the relationship with poverty is not 
so clear and generally tends to vary depending on 
the general income level of the country. 
A systematic review of obesity shows that the 
association between socio-economic status 
and obesity appears to be positive for both 
men and women in low-income countries. 
Those who are more affluent or with higher 
educational attainment tend to be more likely to 
be obese.
140
 On the other hand, more extensive 
evidence shows that in middle- and high-income 
countries, overweight and obesity are linked to 
lower socio-economic settings among women, 
with no association observed among men.
141
 In middle-income countries, the association 
becomes largely mixed for men and mainly 
negative for women. Obesity in children appears 
to be predominantly a problem of the rich in low- 
and middle-income countries.
142
The burden of obesity tends to shift towards 
poorer populations as countries move through 
the nutrition transition.
143
 This shift towards 
overweight and obesity in people with lower 
socio-economic status seems to be happening 
faster in low-income countries than it did in 
high-income countries.
144
 However, there are still inconsistencies in the 
data on this issue. A meta-analysis of the data 
from 62 scientific papers published between 
1990 and 2015 concludes that the studies 
that investigated the association between 
socio-economic status and obesity in children 
point to ambiguous results.
145
 This meta-analysis 
finds that children with lower socio-economic 
status had higher risks of overweight and obesity, 
but the risks did not seem to increase with the 
income level of countries. Moreover, the inverse 
relationship Œ a higher risk of overweight and 
obesity associated with higher socio-economic 
status Œ was found in high-income countries and 
in more economically developed areas.  
Overweight and obesity increase the risk of 
non-communicable diseases, which, in turn, 
can be linked to loss of income or earning 
potential due to illness as well as increased 
healthcare costs. 
The role of inequalities and marginalization in shaping food-security and nutrition outcomes It is clear from the evidence presented up until 
now that economic growth alone is not sufficient 
to reduce extreme poverty or improve food 
security and nutrition. In most cases, the rate 
at which extreme poverty shrinks as growth 
accelerates differs from country to country, 
given the initial level of income inequality in 
the country and changes in income inequality 
over time. 
Inequality, not only in the distribution of 
income, but also in access to nutrition-relevant 
services and social and health infrastructure is 
critical in understanding why economic growth 
alone will not significantly reduce extreme 
poverty or food insecurity and malnutrition. 
Income inequality itself can result not only in 
undernutrition, but also overweight and obesity, 
as the higher costs of nutritious foods induces 
the poor to resort to cheap, energy-dense and 
nutrient-poor foods. 
Furthermore, inequalities within households 
help explain why even when economic growth 
translates into extreme poverty reduction, it 
may not necessarily reduce food insecurity 
and malnutrition. Thus, reducing inequality 
plays an important role in reducing both 
undernourishment and malnutrition.
This is true at all times, not only for periods 
of economic boom. Inequalities are structural 
characteristics of countries that prevent the 
most food-insecure and malnourished people 
from being helped by economic growth, 
but they also expose and make them more 
vulnerable during periods of economic 
turmoil. In fact, evidence indicates that in 
countries that have greater levels of inequality, 
economic slowdowns and downturns have a 
disproportionately negative effect on food and 
nutrition security.
146
| 90 |This section looks more closely at the different 
forms of inequality and the evidence on how 
these inequalities work to shape outcomes 
of food security and nutrition. Five forms of 
inequality are explored: income inequality, 
inequalities between rural and urban 
populations, inequalities in asset distribution, 
marginalization and social exclusion, and 
intra-household inequality.
It is important to acknowledge that any analysis 
on inequality is challenging, as there is a lack of 
data disaggregated by wealth quintile, gender, 
age, geography and disability, which poses a 
significant barrier to addressing inequality and 
tackling undernourishment and malnutrition 
in marginalized groups.
147
 Data on prevalence 
and national averages of undernourishment 
and malnutrition are not sufficient to fully 
understand and address these issues. 
Inequality in income distributionIncome inequality is a defining issue of our 
time. It is also a cause of entrenched uncertainty 
and vulnerability.
148
 A country experiences 
income inequality when not every member of 
its population gets exactly the same share of the 
income the economy is generating. Although the 
world has made remarkable progress in reducing 
extreme poverty, income inequality remains 
high. This means that most of the reduction in 
poverty has been achieved through increased 
economic growth, not through reductions in 
income inequality.
149
 Income inequality has remained constant and 
high over the last 15 years (
Figure 34
).150
 As a region, 
Latin America and the Caribbean shows the 
most progress in reducing income inequality, but 
still has the highest levels of inequality globally 
(Figure 34
). Nonetheless, this overall progress in 
income distribution does not seem to be shown in 
the distribution of workers™ remuneration.
151
 Measured by the shared prosperity premium
152
 Œ the difference between the annual income 
or consumption growth rate of the bottom 
40 percent and the annual growth rate of the 
mean in the economy Œ inequality is rising 
in nearly half of the countries in the world, 
including many low- and middle-income 
countries (
Figure 35
). 
However, when focusing only on low- and 
middle-income countries, the income 
distribution trend is mixed. In 
Figure 36
, countries 
above the line have seen an increase in 
income inequality from 2000 to 2015, whereas 
those below the line have seen a reduction. 
Notably, several countries in Africa and Asia 
have seen large increases in income inequality 
over the last 15 years. Of the 78 countries shown 
in the figure, 58 are high commodity-dependent 
countries. In 12 of these countries, income 
inequality remained unchanged, while 
for 26 of these, inequality increased. 
More importantly, 20 out of these 26 are high 
commodity-dependent countries. 
Income inequality is shaped by the type of 
economic growth and the distribution of 
earnings from factor markets, particularly 
those of labour and capital. Countries in Latin 
America, where inequality remains high, 
implemented many reforms beginning in the 
1990s to open up their economies and promote 
export-led growth. Costa Rica is an example 
in the region of a country where the export 
sector was diversified. Interestingly, income 
inequality rose in Costa Rica as a result of the 
skill intensity of the new export sectors, which 
contributed to widening wage gaps.
153
 Income inequality also shapes the impact of 
economic growth. For instance, if economic 
growth is associated with rising income 
inequality (Kuznets curve),
154
 the poorest may 
not benefit from increased national income.
155
 The links between economic growth with 
increased average incomes and increased food 
and nutrition security can be weaker than 
expected, especially if there are high levels of 
income inequality. In the context of economic 
growth with high inequality, inequalities must 
be addressed to ensure a way out of hunger 
and malnutrition (
Box 14
).Income inequality shapes the impact of economic 
deceleration or contraction on food security 
and nutrition. In countries where inequality is 
greater, economic slowdowns and downturns 
have a disproportionate effect on low-income 
populations in terms of food and nutrition 
security, since they use large portions of their 
income to buy food.

food insecurity, and this effect is 20 percent 
higher for low-income countries compared with 
middle-income countries. An FAO study for 75 
low- and middle-income countries finds that on 
average countries with a high Gini coefficient 
(higher than 0.35) have a 33 percentage point 
higher probability of experiencing severe food 
insecurity.
156
 Indeed, the prevalence of severe 
food insecurity is almost three times higher 
in countries with high income inequality 
(21˜percent) compared with countries with low 
income inequality (7 percent). 
Moreover, the same FAO study finds that in 
countries with high levels of inequality, increases 
in household income are highly correlated 
with a reduction in severe food insecurity. 
Where there is high inequality, this effect is 
almost three times more that of lower levels of 
inequality. A 10 percent increase in household 
income is associated with a 0.8 or 0.3 percentage 
point lower likelihood of severe food insecurity 
in countries with, respectively, high or 
lower inequality.
Income and wealth inequalities are also closely 
associated with undernutrition, while more 
complex inequality patterns are associated with 
obesity. Such inequality patterns associated 
with health conditions are seen in low- and 
middle-income countries. Economic inequalities

Shared prosperity premium is defined as the difference in growth between the average consumption or income per capita (2011 PPP USD per day) of the bottom 40 percent of 
the population, and the growth in income or consumption per capita of the mean population in a country. Since it is a difference between two growth rates, the shared prosperity 
premium is expressed in percentage points. Data on shared prosperity premium are available for 93 countries in the period 2011Œ2016. A positive (negative) shared prosperity 
premium means that the poorest 40 percent in a country are getting a larger (lower) share of the overall income.

there are also substantial inequalities between 
regions and population subgroups. 
Inequality in access to basic services Œ within and 
between rural and urban
 areas Around 40 percent of the inequality in low- and 
lower-middle-income countries is due to the 
gap in living standards between rural and urban 
populations,

people living in rural areas. Around two-thirds of

in access to basic services such as education and 
health care are well known. However, in the 2000s 
inequality declined substantially, while the economy 
grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent between 1999 
and 2014.1 The Gini coefficient dropped from 59 in 
1999 to 51 in 2014, and income grew substantially 
among the poorest. As a result, the reductions in 
poverty and inequality followed a similarly 
impressively downward pattern during the 2000s 
(figure below): 26.5 million Brazilians exited poverty 
between 2004 and 2014. 
The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) was 
reduced from 11.9 percent in 1999Œ2001 to less than 
2.5 percent in 2008Œ2010.2 At the same time, the 
rate of stunting for children under five years of age 
was reduced by 6 percent per year between 1996 
and 2007, reaching 7.1 percent.3 While Brazil made 
considerable progress in reducing stunting, obesity 
rates remained high and continue to climb.The increase in household income combined with 
strong and coordinated social, education, health 
policies as well as policies favourable to the productive 
sectors have been key for poverty and inequality 
reduction during 2002Œ2014. Nearly two-thirds of 
the annual poverty reduction rate in the country could 
be explained by the effects of median-income growth, 
especially up until 2008.4 The effect of coordinated 
policies was also important, especially when the 
growth effect diminished.Among these policies, Fome Zero represented a key 
initiative of the new Brazilian Government in 2003. 
It transformed food security and nutrition into a crucial 
issue in the social and economic policy strategy, 
 and also mainstreamed hunger eradication into the 
political agenda.5| 95 |Despite recent progress, rural areas may 
not always fully benefit from advances in 
national economic development and may 
experience lower levels of public investment in 
infrastructure and poorer access to essential 
services, including quality health care, 
education, water and sanitation,
160
 which 
negatively impacts people™s livelihoods, food 
security and nutrition. 
Country-level data show that in many low- and 
middle-income countries, the prevalence of 
stunting among children is higher in rural as 
compared to urban areas, according to joint 
WHO, UNICEF and World Bank global data on 
malnutrition.
161
 Furthermore, according to a 
pooled data analysis from multiple countries, 
women in rural areas have an increased risk 
of anaemia compared with those living in 
urban areas, especially among women with 
lower socio-economic status.
162
 However, the 
differences in prevalence of overweight among 
young children between urban and rural areas 
are quite small, and the gap in adult obesity rates 
between urban and rural areas is narrowing 
 (see Part 1 of this report).
BOX 14(CONTINUED)Fome Zero and its successor,
 Brasil sem Miseria, coordinated several programmes in diverse sectors: 
cash transfers, school feeding, access to health, 
 family farming, productive inclusion and access 
to water, housing and sanitation facilities, among 
others.6 One of these is Bolsa Família, Brazil™s 
flagship conditional cash transfer (CCT) programme. 
Between 2004 and 2014, Bolsa Familia increased 
its expenditure from 0.29˚percent to 0.46 percent of 
annual GDP, and household coverage from 6.6˚million 
to 14˚million households.7 It is estimated that the cash transfer component of 
Bolsa Familia has been responsible for 25 percent 
of extreme poverty reduction and near 15 percent of 
poverty reduction since 2004.
8 Its distribution effect 
could explain between 1˚percent and 1.5 percent of 
the annual Gini coefficient reduction in the country.
9 Other policies directed specifically to rural populations 
have been important for the observed poverty and 
inequality reduction process. For example, Brazil is 
one of the few countries of the LAC region that has 
a non-contributive pension mechanism especially 
designed towards rural populations Œ Previdência 
Rural. Several studies have shown the importance 
of the programme for the income of vulnerable rural 
populations.101 World Bank. 2019. World Development Indicators. In:

  »| 96 |Regarding feeding practices, research findings 
indicate that infants in rural areas have higher 
levels of exclusive breastfeeding and continued 
breastfeeding for the first and second year than 
their urban peers. However, the complementary 
feeding practices are of poorer quality compared 
with those of urban areas. In urban areas, infants 
and young children are more likely to be fed with 
more diverse and frequent meals.
163
 Alarmingly, 
only one out of every six children aged 6Œ23 
months in low- and middle-income rural and 
urban settings receives a minimum acceptable 
diet Œ i.e. one that meets both the minimum 
number of meals and minimum˜diet diversity.
164
 Inequalities in accessing basic services 
that are critical to eradicating hunger and 
malnutrition are also seen within urban 
areas. Massive rural-to-urban migration
165
 is 
creating ﬁhidden citiesﬂ of extreme poor urban 
populations, including over 800 million people 
living in slum conditions who are often not 
accounted for in official statistics.
166
 These urban 
poor are particularly vulnerable to financial 
crises or food price hikes.
167
 While urban 
populations enjoy better health on average, 
moving to or living in an urban area does not 
necessarily guarantee this health for everyone, 
and inequalities within urban populations are 
growing. For example, rates of stunting among 
the poorest urban populations can be as high 
or even higher than rates among poor rural 
children.
168
 One-third of the world™s stunted 
children now live in urban areas.
169
 For poor urban households, food security 
and nutrition are more dependent on families 
having cash to buy food and meet other needs 
than in poor rural households. This means that 
households rely on labour markets to provide 
jobs for family members with women often 
dependent on employment in the informal sector. 
Parents and other caregivers have to spend more 
time outside home with potential consequences 
for childcare and feeding.
170
 Furthermore, access 
to services such as health care, safe water and 
sanitation is unequal.
171
 Alarmingly, the nutrition 
transition, which has seen shifts in consumption 
patterns from traditional foods that are often 
more healthy to highly processed foods often 
high in dietary energy, saturated fat, sugars and 
salt, is happening fastest in the urban areas of 
low- and middle-income countries, bringing 
with it increased risk of overweight, obesity and 
diet-related diseases.
172
The poorest of the poor are, therefore, most 
vulnerable to economic slowdowns and 
downturns whether they live in rural or urban 
areas.
173
 Inclusive development policies aligned 
across sectors, which address the vulnerability 
of the rural poor and protect and increase the 
resilience of the poorest urban populations, 
are needed. These are particularly important in 
the face of economic slowdowns or downturns. 
They can protect the poor when public and 
private expenditures in basic services are cut 
due to lack of fiscal space. And they can protect 
the poor from undesirable coping strategies with 
negative impacts on food security and nutrition, 
as described in Section 2.2. 
As has already been shown, during economic 
crises, access to health care often deteriorates, 
particularly for poorer population groups.
174
 Government spending on publicly funded 
health services is often reduced in real terms, 
while healthcare demand tends to shift from 
private to public services because of the lower 
cost.
175
 Resource constraints during economic 
slowdowns and downturns may result in 
restricted access to health care, availability, 
cost and deterioration in the quality of services 
provided, especially among the poor and 
marginalized groups.
176
 These conditions are 
likely to disrupt treatment and subsequently 
worsen disease outcomes.
177
Economic downturns and slowdowns also 
affect access to education. During times of 
economic crisis, governments™ capacity to 
fund education is often reduced, and families 
may be less able to invest in education. At the 
same time, resource constraints may negatively 
impact the quality of education.
178
 Again, these 
constraints disproportionately affect poor 
and marginalized groups. Unless there are 
contingency mechanisms and funds in place to 
reverse such effects on education, there may be 
long-term effects on human capital and a higher 
risk that children are taken out of school so that 
they can contribute to a household™s income, 
with consequences for their nutrition, as further 
explained below.
179
| 97 |Inequality in the distribution of productive assetsEvidence shows that equitable access to assets 
is a way through which economic progress for 
everyone can be enhanced.
180
 The greater the 
inequality in asset distribution such as land, 
water, capital, finance, education and health, 
the more difficult it is for the poor to participate 
in economic growth processes. This then slows 
the progress in reducing food insecurity and 
malnutrition. For example, poor people often 
have little education, which prevents them from 
participating in labour markets that offer higher 
wages. This in turn reduces the rate of overall 
economic growth, further harming the poor and 
challenging their food security and nutrition.
Land-resource scarcity and inequities are 
growing, with poor and marginalized population 
groups worldwide often having the least access 
to land. They are confined to ﬁpoverty trapsﬂ 
of marginal and degraded lands of poor quality 
soils, where they are vulnerable to climate 
variability and have no secure tenure.
181
 Women, 
for instance, make essential contributions to 
agriculture in low-income countries; yet, they 
have less access to productive resources and 
opportunities than men.
182
Even in the context of sub-Saharan Africa, where 
arable land is relatively abundant as a whole 
compared with other regions, data at the country 
level reveal that the amount of suitable land per 
rural inhabitant varies considerably, and that 
about one-third of the countries have less than 
one hectare of land suitable for agriculture. 
Furthermore, recent data on inequality of land 
distribution shows that surplus land in the region 
is not only concentrated within relatively few 
countries, but that unequal distribution of land is 
very high in many countries (
Figure 37
).183
Inequality in land ownership not only challenges 
livelihoods, but also undermines the productive 
capacity of the population. One study found 
that less inequality in land ownership across 
agricultural populations, as opposed to inequality 
within the landholding class, has been associated 
with greater public provision of education.
184
 Women often have no security of tenure or access 
to financial credit.
185
 They are disproportionately 
represented among landless populations that 
face food insecurity and are unable to meet basic 
needs. This often pushes them into wage farm 
labour and endangers their livelihoods (
Box 16
).186
 Like land access, water availability affects the 
livelihoods of billions globally and contributes 
to food security, nutrition and environmental 
health.
187
 Inequalities in water access in terms 
of availability, access, safety and sustainability 
are defined across geographical regions on 
the basis of gender, economic, political and 
power relations, and thus work prominently 
to the disadvantage of women, smallholder 
farmers, indigenous communities and 
pastoralists.
188
 Unfortunately, the multiple 
linkages between water, land, soils, food and

programmes for inclusive economic growth and 
sustainable development.
Marginalization and social exclusionSocial exclusion is a dynamic process embedded 
in unequal power relationships that operate 
across economic, political, social and cultural 
dimensions. The economic dimension is 
defined by access to and distribution of 
material resources necessary to sustain life. 
The political dimension relates to power 
dynamics and unequal patterns of both formal 
rights and the conditions in which rights are 
exercised, including access to services.
189
 These dimensions also affect food security 
and nutrition. 
Given this context, socially excluded and 
marginalized groups Œ such as ethnic and 
religious minorities, indigenous populations 
and people with disabilities Œ are likely to be 
hit particularly hard by economic downturns. 
These groups already have poorer access to 
resources and essential services, and these 
inequalities are likely to increase during 
economic crises.
190
 Indigenous populations around the world, for 
example, are often affected by poor food security 
and nutrition. They frequently live in extreme 
poverty and in environments that have been 
damaged; or they have lost their land and no 
longer have access to traditional food sources. 
As a result, they are particularly exposed to 
different types of shocks, including climate and 
economic shocks (
Box 15
). 
Minority ethnic groups are often at higher risk 
of different forms of malnutrition. Children in 
most disadvantaged ethnic groups in low- and 
lower-middle-income countries have on average 
2.8 times the rate of stunting and six times 
the rate of wasting compared with their more 
advantaged peers, although the disparities are 
much higher in some countries. Additionally, 
ethnic disparities appear to be increasing in 
many countries.
191
 People living with a disability 
are also often more vulnerable to food insecurity 
and malnutrition, and this relationship is 
bidirectional through poor living conditions and 
lack of access to health services.
192
 Although analyses are limited, data from 
more developed economies show that socially 
disadvantaged groups are often at increased 
risk of malnutrition. Evidence from several 
middle- and high-income countries suggests that 
mothers from socially disadvantaged groups, 
including ethnic minorities and indigenous 
populations, have a higher risk of giving birth 
to babies of low birthweight
193
 and of being 
affected by anaemia.
194
 Furthermore, in low- 
and lower-middle-income countries differences 
in rates of childhood overweight between 
ethnic groups have been observed.
195
 In some 
high-income countries, rates of overweight and 
obesity among children and adolescents have 
been rising faster in minority ethnic populations

 Inequality within households Inequalities of social, political and economic 
power are not only seen within societies as a 
whole, but also within households. They can 
make economic events particularly beneficial for 
some, but not for all members of the household. 
At the household level, differential inequalities 
are determined by who has the power in 
deciding, for example, what is consumed.
197
 ﬁBargaining-powerﬂ models within households 
suggest that incomes are rarely pooled 
together.
198
 Consequently, gender inequalities 
and power struggles tend to exacerbate poverty 
and deprivation of food and nutritional security 
during periods of economic slowdown or 
downturn. Such intra-household inequalities 
often affect children negatively, depending on 
factors like gender, age, birth order, and mother™s 
socio-economic status.
199
The allocation of food can be severely constrained 
during economic slowdowns and downturns and 
this can be particularly challenging for some 
members of the household. More generally, while 
no systematic bias at the global level has been 
observed towards one specific age or sex group 
within a household concerning intra-household 
food distribution,
200
 wide consensus posits that 
women are disadvantaged in the allocation 
of food (
Box 16
). Also, pregnant women tend 
to receive relatively lower allocations, with 
likelihood of serious consequences for their own 
and their child™s nutritional status.
201
 Moreover, 
  »| 99 |Indigenous peoples are disproportionately represented 
among food-insecure and hungry populations.
1 For 
instance, Native Americans in the United States of 
America are at least twice as likely to be food 
insecure as non-Native Americans.2 In Guatemala, 
indigenous children aged below five are twice as 
likely to be stunted compared to non-indigenous 
children.3 Similarly, indigenous peoples are 
disproportionately affected by the prevalence of 
poverty. Despite their contributions to economic 
empowerment and social development, indigenous 
women often face marginalization and discrimination 
even within their own communities.4 While indigenous 
peoples represent 5 percent of the world's population, 
they represent 15 percent of the world's poor.
5 In 
Ecuador, while the national poverty rate was 
30 percent in 2012, it was at 60 percent for the 
indigenous peoples.6 The prevalent loss of control over their territories 
and resources have left indigenous peoples 
impoverished in many countries. Resource-extracting 
development models pose threats to their lands,7 especially in the absence of documented land rights 
and tenure security. Recent changes in economic 
conditions, climate and access to natural resources 
have adversely affected their livelihood strategies, 
which further exacerbates the prevalence of poverty, 
food insecurity and hunger among these groups. 
Indigenous peoples™ territories cover about 
22 percent of the global surface and contain 
80 percent of the world™s biodiversity.
8 Because their 
lands and territories have not been subject to intensive 
development, they have been able to maintain 
biodiversity on these lands over millennia, which 
is central to their livelihoods and natural resource 
management strategies.9 Indigenous peoples™ traditional food systems 
involve the production of diverse foods with minimal 
negative impact to the environment. These systems 
are anchored in sustainable livelihood practices, 
adapted to ecosystems of their territories, and are 
rooted in biodiversity conservation which ensures 
adequate dietary diversity.
10 Many neglected and 
underutilized species that they cultivate are nutrient 
dense, functional foods, rich source of micronutrients, 
and have an untapped livelihood and nutritional 
potential. For instance, Marula, native in Southern 
and Eastern Africa, provides four times the content 
of vitamin C contained in an orange. Marula has 
been promoted as a sustainable plant food for rural 
development.11 Indigenous peoples™ traditional farming 
practices including diversification of land use, crop 
rotations and crop diversification supports adaption to 
climate change. Their diets from foods harvested from 
forests to nutrient rich local fish, are diversified and 
suited to the local environments, and are a response 
to malnutrition. 
Greater attention to address the inequalities that 
prevent harnessing the knowledge and nurturing 
indigenous peoples™ traditional food systems, including 
through increased access through the natural resources 
they rely upon, will facilitate making their dietary 
diversity more sustainable in the face of economic and 
climate shocks.1 I. Anderson, B. Robson, M. Connolly, F. Al-Yaman, E. Bjertness, A. King, M. Tynan

BOX 15INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS IS KEY TO NURTURING 
THEIR DIETARY DIVERSITY
| 100 |Women play an indispensable role in on-farm and 
off-farm activities, particularly in rural areas, which 
contribute to economic welfare and food security of 
their households. Approximately 43 percent of the 
global agricultural workforce is made up of women.1 The contribution of women to labour in African 
agriculture is regularly quoted in the range of 
60Œ80 percent. Using individual, plot-level labour 
input data from nationally representative household 
surveys across six sub-Saharan African countries, 
recent evidence2 challenges the conventional wisdom 
by estimating the average female labour share in crop 
production at 40 percent. The evidence shows that this 
share was slightly above 50 percent in Malawi, 
Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania, and 
substantially lower in Nigeria (37 percent), Ethiopia 
(29 percent) and the Niger (24 percent). 
The agricultural productivity of women has direct 
implications on income as well as on the food security 
of their households. Evidence suggests that increased 
income for women is associated with greater food 
consumption and improved nutritional status of 
household members.3As economies grow and transform, new 
opportunities emerge for rural populations. 
Improved infrastructure and services, increased access 
to education, information, credit, technology, technical 
skills as well as improved access to agricultural 
value chains and markets open up new economic 
opportunities for both men and women. However, the 
extent to which women and men are able to benefit 
from these growing opportunities differs.
4 Women often 
face greater challenges in accessing input factors (i.e. 
land, labour and financial services). For instance, less 
than 5 percent of women in North Africa and West 
Asia are agricultural landholders. In sub-Saharan 
Africa, the proportion of women holding agricultural 
land ranges widely from less than 5 percent in Mali up 
to 30 percent in Botswana and Malawi.1 Further, many 
  women face greater difficulty than men accessing 
agricultural labour and formal financial services.
2 Agricultural production outcomes also differ greatly 
between men and women. There is evidence that 
the gaps in agricultural productivity between women 
and men with similar-sized plots in a similar context 
range from 23 percent in United Republic of Tanzania, 
24 percent in Ethiopia, 25 percent in Malawi, 
33 percent in Uganda, and to 66 percent in the 
Niger.
5 Traditional roles also require women to spend 
significant amounts of time on household chores and in 
caring for infants and young children, which limits their 
participation in income-generating opportunities that 
arise when economies grow.
6 In developing countries, 
estimates indicate that women spend three hours more 
per day on unpaid work than men.2 Finally, when 
rural women migrate in search of greater employment 
opportunities, they often face barriers seeking decent 
work, training opportunities, assets and personal safety.
7 However, narrowing the gender dimensions 
of inequality goes beyond strengthening women's 
economic opportunities and decision-making capacities 
in groups and organizations. It also requires an 
in-depth understanding of intra-household dynamics 
where, in some parts of the world, men and women 
within the same household pursue separate livelihood 
strategies. While women are typically disadvantaged 
in terms of access to resources, services and markets, 
and burdened by more onerous daily tasks, they 
also lack a voice in determining household priorities, 
spending patterns and distribution of benefits. 
This includes gender inequalities in intra-household 
food allocation, which can result in a gender gap 
in food and nutrition security.
8 Consequently, what 
happens inside the family has substantial implications 
not only for individual motivation and well-being, but 
also for productivity and investments in agriculture and 
rural development, and more importantly for food and 
nutrition security within the household.

BOX 16GENDER DIMENSIONS OF INEQUALITY IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL AREAS
| 101 |studies done in some regions in South Asia have 
found that in periods of critical food shortages, 
the highest inequity within households tends 
to occur in households experiencing severe or 
unexpected food insecurity.
202
Increasingly, evidence on associations between 
intra-household inequalities and malnutrition 
indicates that females score worse on nutritional 
indicators compared with males. In Bangladesh, 
for instance, household survey data reveal that 
men tend to have much smaller dietary energy 
shortfalls compared with women.
203
 Of growing 
concern is the coexistence of underweight or 
stunted children with overweight mothers 
in the same households in various low- and 
middle-income countries, such as Bangladesh, 
Ghana, India, Kenya and Peru.
204
 This suggests 
increasing inequalities in economic and social 
access to resources. The combination of different 
inequalities contributing to stunting and 
overweight phenomena have been linked to 
maternal age at first birth, maternal short stature, 
family size and socio-economic status.

  POLICIES FOR ACHIEVING 
SUSTAINABLE ESCAPES 
FROM FOOD INSECURITY 
AND MALNUTRITION IN 
THE CONTEXT OF 
ECONOMIC SLOWDOWNS 
AND DOWNTURNS KEY MESSAGES 
 Responding to economic events that constrain 
households™ purchasing power requires short- and long-term 
policy responses to safeguard food security and nutrition. 
Actions will depend on institutional capacity and availability 
of contingency mechanisms and funds to respond. 
 Countries need to protect incomes in the short term, 
particularly for the most affected households, through 
social protection programmes, public works programmes, 
or policies aimed at stabilizing food prices. At the same 
time, they need to avoid cuts in essential social services.
 Countries need to invest wisely during periods of 
economic boom to reduce economic vulnerabilities and 
build capacity to quickly recover when economic turmoil 
erupts. This requires balancing a set of policies for an 
inclusive transformation that is characterized by economic 
diversification, human capital accumulation and universal 
access to health care and other social services.
 Given the rising importance of global trade in food and 
agricultural commodities, trade policy also needs to feature 
prominently in the minds of policymakers when promoting 
economic transformation that helps achieve food security 
and nutrition objectives. 
 Integrating food security and nutrition concerns into 
poverty reduction efforts, while increasing synergies 
between poverty reduction and hunger eradication, helps 
accelerate both goals. 
 When implementing these policies, reducing gender 
inequalities and social exclusion of population groups 
needs to be either the means to, or outcome of, improved 
food security and nutrition.
  »| 102 |The imperative of safeguarding food security and nutrition In the absence of policies and resilience 
capacity to face economic slowdowns and 
downturns when they occur, households 
will suffer a decline in their purchasing 
power, either through income loss, higher 
domestic prices, or both. In attempting to 
meet their food needs with reduced budgets, 
while perhaps also facing higher food prices, 
households may resort to coping strategies that 
can further weaken their food security and 
nutritional status. 
While adverse economic conditions affect 
food security and nutrition in all countries 
through the channels analysed in Section 
2.2, their impact was stronger in countries 
depending heavily on commodity imports 
and exports in the most recent 2011Œ2017 
period. Moreover, as was also discussed 
previously, economic slowdowns and 
downturns have different impacts on 
different population groups, and their effects 
on food security and nutrition cannot be 
separated from the underlying factors of 
poverty and inequality. 
This final section spells out potential policy 
responses to safeguard food security and 
nutrition in the face of economic slowdowns 
and downturns. It considers short-term policies 
that can directly and immediately tackle the 
main transmission channels from which the 
impacts of economic slowdowns and downturns 
flow. In the longer term, the responses will 
need to be guided by a vision of development 
that fosters pro-poor and inclusive structural 
transformation, allowing countries to diversify 
their economies and reduce their commodity 
dependence, and ultimately lower their 
economic vulnerability. Moreover, this section 
makes the case for the need to enhance the 
synergies among different policies towards 
reducing poverty, inequalities, food insecurity 
and malnutrition, as these phenomena are not 
easily dissociated. 
Policies to respond to the key transmission channels of economic slowdowns and downturns The main transmission channels linking the 
effects of economic slowdowns and downturns 
to food security and nutrition (
Figure 29
) feature 
prominently in the earlier analysis of this second 
part of the report for a very good reason: their 
understanding is critical for policymakers to 
decide what to do when these economic events 
begin to appear. External events, including 
commodity price fluctuations, can have direct 
impacts through terms of trade, exchange rate 
and balance of payments. Secondary indirect 
effects may arise through inflation and food 
prices; unemployment, wages and income; and 
health expenditures. Food security and nutrition 
will be affected depending on the ability of 
individuals and households Œ strengthened 
by appropriate policies Œ to cope with these 
economic events. 
As shall be seen below, food security and 
nutrition will ultimately be affected depending on 
the policy responses put in place to either bring 
about economic adjustment (e.g. through fiscal 
and trade policies), or to help strengthen the 
resilience of households to economic shocks, 
and thus prevent undesirable coping strategies 
(e.g. through social protection or social sectoral 
policies), or both. Indeed, there needs to be a 
unique set of policies to address the myriad of 
potential transmission channels that economic 
slowdowns and downturns present for food 
security and nutrition. Known as countercyclical 
policies, these should aim at smoothing out the 
cycles by targeting both the demand side and the 
supply side of the economy. Some of these policy 
responses are discussed here, in relation to the 
key transmission channels. 
At the same time, the following discussion 
also shows that, in addition to responding to 
the transmission channels, policymakers must 
continue with some key existing policies for 
nutrition and health, including maintaining the 
delivery and the quality of relevant care and 
health services and ensuring universal access to 
those services as well as adequate access to water 
and sanitation. These basic policies tend to be 
highly affected by cuts in social spending during 
| 103 |economic slowdowns and downturns if there is 
no contingency to prevent them.
Curbing rising food prices or offsetting their effects
International commodity price shocks and 
volatility transmit effects into the economy 
through exchange rate adjustments, as 
highlighted before. Declining commodity prices 
have resulted in currency depreciations and 
devaluations leading to domestic price increases. 
Policy responses in the face of this trend are 
both short and long term in nature. In the short 
term, there may be actions to offset the effect on 
domestic price increases, particularly food prices. 
In a different scenario, international food prices 
may rise, even if other commodity prices decline. 
In the long term, policies will target the supply 
side of the economy (to boost economic activity 
and diversification) so as to face down the secular 
downward trend of commodity prices, as further 
explained below.
Countries that depend on food imports are 
particularly vulnerable to commodity price 
fluctuations leading to an increase in food 
prices. When these prices rise significantly, poor 
households and those that are net food buyers 
can be highly affected. In most cases, the group 
of net food buyers includes poor farmers, who 
may not be able to take advantage of the rise in 
food prices by increasing their production (and 
earnings) and accessing markets.
To mitigate the negative impact of rising 
food prices on food security and nutrition, 
policymakers should consider different factors: 
the specific food items affected by the rising 
prices; the distribution of households between 
net food buyers and sellers; the possibility 
of substitution among different food items, 
without negatively affecting the quality of diets; 
and the potential negative effects of the policy 
response itself.
The most common policies that countries 
implement to promote food security and 
nutrition in the context of rising food prices 
can be classified into three groups.
206
 The first 
group includes universal policies aimed at 
reducing excessive volatility of food prices in 
the short term, such as restrictions on exports 
of staple food items, use of food stocks to boost 
the food supply, consumption subsidies for 
certain essential food items, and import tariff 
and consumption/sales tax cuts, among others. 
While implementing some of these policies can 
be necessary for political reasons,
207
 it should 
be stressed that they may not necessarily be 
first-best policies. Some of these measures can 
be rather costly if they provide a price subsidy 
not only to poor and vulnerable households, but 
to the general population. They can also create 
pervasive market distortions and, in a trade 
context, can create negative externalities for 
other countries. 
Social protection measures and other policies 
aimed at protecting purchasing power and access 
to social services constitute the second group. 
Social protection programmes play a critical 
role in both helping households avoid negative 
coping mechanisms and in accelerating recovery 
after adverse economic episodes, through the 
creation of new economic opportunities and 
the fostering of human capital in the long run 
(Box 17
). For example, homegrown school feeding 
is a social protection strategy with proven effects 
in preventing undesirable coping strategies 
(Box 18
). These measures aimed at producing 
positive results in the short and long term may be 
preferable to policies aimed at reducing excessive 
volatility of food prices. In many cases these 
measures are targeted to those that most need 
them. But it is also important to ensure universal 
coverage to social services and social protection 
as this protects families in times of economic 
crisis from having to decide whether to spend 
money on food or health. 
The third group comprises medium- and 
long-term policies to boost domestic production 
of food, such as free or subsidized input 
distribution, import-tariff or value-added tax 
cuts on fertilizers and technology for agricultural 
production, government-funded agricultural 
research and extension activities, and 
subsidies for the adoption of new technologies 
and irrigation. 
These policies need to be carefully designed and 
implemented to avoid unintended consequences. 
For example, consumer subsidies for staple food 
(cereals, oil, sugar) in many countries of the 
Near East and North Africa region seem to be 
  »| 104 |Low-income countries are increasingly expanding their 
social protection systems, particularly social assistance, 
which may include social transfers and other 
programmes that ensure access to social services, 
social support and care services, in addition to 
legislation and policy reforms that ensure equity and 
non-discrimination. Social protection plays a critical 
role in improving poor households™ access to food and 
health care, which are essential for adequate nutrition, 
particularly for women and children.
1 Cash transfer programmes are social assistance 
programmes that are usually targeted at poor and 
vulnerable groups.2 Available evidence shows that 
these programmes improve household dietary diversity, 
increase food consumption3 and enhance productive 
capacity, with positive effects on the availability 
of more and higher quality food.4 However, their 
impact on diet diversity among young children is 
still inconclusive,5 and likewise the evidence in child 
nutritional status.6 Potential explanations include 
the multidimensional nature of the determinants of 
malnutrition, which require multisectoral approaches 
to see long-term changes; limited attention to explicit 
nutrition goals and actions; and poor service quality, 
which may explain the lack of overall nutrition 
benefits.7 Studies suggest that programmes with larger 
impacts are those that have a larger transfer size and 
are of long duration, are targeted at young children in 
low-income households, and include complementary 
nutritional features.8In the humanitarian context, cash transfer 
programmes are also being increasingly used. 
An analysis of these programmes in over 62 
countries9 finds that they can support access to food 
and livelihoods, and prevent deteriorations in child 
nutrition.10 Launched in 2005, Ethiopia™s Productive Safety Net 
Programme (PSNP) is one of the most important and 
largest social safety net programmes in Africa.11  It contributes to both reducing poverty and strengthening 
the resilience of vulnerable households in the face of 
recurrent climate hazards and other shocks. The PSNP 
is the only social protection programme which has 
considered food security and nutrition as well as 
Disaster Risk Reduction in its design since its inception. 
It is therefore a reference for other African countries on 
shock-responsive social protection. It currently covers 
8 million beneficiaries nationwide. Most notably, the 
PNSP included a contingency budget equivalent to 
20 percent of the base programme cost and a risk 
financing facility designed to respond to transitory needs 
of the chronically food insecure. When such contingency 
was exhausted, a Risk Financing Mechanism (RFM) 
was developed. The financial facility and the RFM were 
crucial to the impact and effectiveness of the PNSP in 
response to the 2011 Horn of Africa crises.

BOX 17SOCIAL PROTECTION IS CRITICAL FOR FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION, ESPECIALLY 
DURING ECONOMIC SLOWDOWNS AND DOWNTURNS| 105 |promoting unbalanced diets, increasing the risk 
of malnutrition and health among the population. 
Poor diets distorted by subsidies can contribute 
to greater disease burden, lead to excess health 
expenditures of households and have economic 
impact on countries in terms of lost productivity 
and foregone economic growth associated with 
stunting and obesity.
During periods of economic difficulty, children face the 
risk of being taken out of school to contribute to the 
household income as well as of having less access to 
nutritious and balanced meals. Homegrown school 
feeding, which features among a number of possible 
social protection programmes, may help policymakers 
to reduce this risk. This innovative approach˚links 
school feeding programmes with local smallholder 
farmers to provide millions of school children with 
food that is safe, diverse, nutritious and above all 
local. Nearly half the world™s school children, some 
310 million, in low- and middle-income countries eat a 
daily meal at school, making this the most widespread 
safety net. Moreover, homegrown school feeding can 
not only tackle food insecurity for school-age children, 
but can also provide income benefits to communities 
at large.The last ten years have seen a growing global 
consensus that school feeding programmes generate 
positive impacts, with the available evidence pointing 
to multiple benefits.1 School feeding generates 
high returns in four critical areas that translate into 
human capital growth and sustainable development: 
increasing access to education, especially for girls; 
improving nutrition and health which, in turn, benefits 
cognition and learning, especially for the most 
vulnerable children; providing essential safety nets for 
poor children and their families; and stimulating local 
economies, especially in the agricultural sector.
The value of meals in school is equivalent to 
about 10 percent of families™ income. For families 
with several children, that can mean substantial 
savings. At the same time, this may also generate new 
economic activity. 
Linking local consumption to local production 
helps create a stable and predictable market for 
local farmers, especially smallholders, including 
many women and mothers. In Brazil, for example, 
30 percent of all purchases for school feeding come 
from smallholder agriculture. Another example of a 
large-scale homegrown programme is in Nigeria, 
where 6 million locally sourced eggs and 80 tonnes of 
fish are consumed by 9.2 million schoolchildren across 
the nation every week.
With the schools as reliable markets, farmers earn 
more income, which they spend in other parts of the 
economy. As the process continues, school feeding 
programmes create local income multipliers and 
spillovers by linking the school feeding programmes 
to caterers, traders, households, businesses and other 
activities in the local economy.
2 The Homegrown 
School Feeding Programme in rural Kenya, for 
instance, has a large income multiplier: each United 
States dollar (USD) transferred to a school for food 
purchases creates an additional USD 2.74 of total 
household nominal (cash) income in rural areas. 
In recognition of the importance of school feeding 
programmes, many countries are including these 
initiatives in their strategies for achieving food security 
and implementing the 2030 Sustainable Development 
Agenda. Many governments are increasingly sourcing 
food for school feeding locally from smallholder 
farmers in a bid to boost local agriculture, strengthen 
local food systems and move people out of poverty.

BOX 18HOMEGROWN SCHOOL FEEDING AS A WAY TO PREVENT UNDESIRABLE 
 COPING STRATEGIES
  »| 106 |can be particularly challenging during an 
economic slowdown or downturn if this leads 
to cuts in public social protection spending due 
to reduced government revenue. It requires 
both the existence of contingency mechanisms 
and funds Œ generated during periods of 
economic growth Œ and adequate institutional 
capacity. The successful scaling up of the system 
contributes to protect poor and vulnerable 
households, minimizing the likelihood that 
they use negative copying strategies with 
long-term consequences. 
Kenya™s Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) 
is an example of a flexible and scalable social 
protection programme that provides a rapid 
response at times when the income of households 
is affected.
210
 During more stable times, 
 it functions like a standard social assistance 
programme, delivering cash transfers to poor 
households in northern counties of Kenya. 
However, the HSNP is also prepared to quickly 
scale up its coverage to other vulnerable 
households during climate shocks, like 
droughts.
211
 For that purpose, the programme 
has registered all households living in high-risk 
locations and has opened a bank account for each 
of them. Using satellite data, an early warning 
system indicates when an area is affected by a 
severe weather event, allowing the programme to 
respond by delivering additional cash transfers to 
all the households in the affected areas. 
Another important set of social assistance 
programmes are Public Works Programmes. 
These can be used as a short-term safety net 
to protect the purchasing power of poor and 
vulnerable households at times of economic 
slowdowns or downturns.
212
 Unlike cash transfers 
(Box 17
), public works programmes do not require 
detailed information to identify their intended 
beneficiaries. They offer low-skill, low-paying 
temporary jobs, usually attracting those workers 
that are not able to find a job in the labour 
market. Through the generation of public jobs 
in the construction and rehabilitation of local 
infrastructure, this kind of programme provides 
poor households with a stable source of income 
during critical times and improves their access 
to basic services in the longer term. There are 
many costs and implications in terms of design 
and implementation, however, which should 
Boosting job creation and incomes The real economy responds to world and 
domestic price adjustments in various ways, as 
noted already. When sluggish economic activity 
is the result, this will lead to unemployment, 
loss of wages and, consequently, loss of income. 
Before policies can be put in place to achieve 
the structural transformations that can shield 
the economy against these external shocks, 
policymakers may need to resort to other types 
of short-term responses to minimize or, even 
better, fully offset the impacts on food security 
and nutrition. 
Social protection programmes can enable 
countries to protect the poor and vulnerable in 
the event of an economic slowdown or downturn, 
safeguarding their food security and nutrition, 
while also triggering other economic benefits. 
The example of school feeding illustrates the 
dual functionality of social protection in terms 
of improving food security and nutrition while 
promoting local economic activity (
Box 18
). 
But social protection can also foster human 
capital in the long run, including through the 
impacts on food security and nutrition, while 
enhancing the productive capacity of beneficiary 
households (
Box 17
). And because social protection 
is usually targeted towards poor and vulnerable 
groups, mainly through social assistance, it is a 
policy strategy than can tackle the inequalities 
that prevent many people from improving their 
food security and nutrition during economic 
booms Œ as has been the case for some low- and 
middle-income countries.
208
 To enhance their impact and role, countries 
are starting to develop risk-informed and 
shock-responsive systems during times of 
stability, strengthening certain mechanisms in 
order to identify not only the poorest households, 
but also those which could be most affected and 
in need of assistance when a shock occurs.
209
 Key features of these programmes include 
comprehensive social registries with information 
on poor and vulnerable households; and 
early-warning information systems to alert when, 
and in what manner, a programme response 
is required. To be effective, these programmes 
should be able not only to maintain the support 
provided at times of stability, but also to scale 
up at times of economic slumps. However, this 
| 107 |be taken into account when deciding on this 
type of intervention 
vis-à-vis
 unconditional 
cash transfers, particularly in fragile and crisis 
contexts.
213
In some countries, for example the Republic 
of Korea after the crisis in 1997, public works 
programmes were implemented with the 
main objective of providing temporary jobs to 
unemployed workers. In others, such as 
 Sri Lanka after the 2004 tsunami, programmes 
pursued a double objective: providing affected 
households with a reliable source of income 
and, at the same time, rebuilding community 
and basic infrastructure to speed up the 
recovery. Then there is the Mahatma Gandhi 
National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme 
(MGNREGS), introduced by India in 2005, 
which is the largest public works programme 
in the world. Unlike the previous cases, the 
MGNREGS was not designed to address 
employment problems arising from an economic 
downturn or to rebuild infrastructure damaged 
by a natural disaster. Building on the experience 
of the state of Maharashtra, the MGNREGS 
instead guarantees up to 100 days of unskilled 
manual work on public projects during the lean 
seasons, at the statutory minimum wage, to all 
rural households. In this way, the programme 
helps rural households to stabilize their 
earnings and to smooth their consumption all 
along the year.
Initial feasibility and subsequent sustainability of countercyclical policies One of the most important challenges faced 
by policymakers at the time of economic 
slowdowns or downturns is the limited amount of 
government resources to fund the implementation 
of public policies. Insufficient funding, or other 
political priorities, can hinder the possibility of 
maintaining and scaling up the support provided 
by the public sector to poor and vulnerable 
households. Establishing countercyclical financial 
mechanisms to safeguard regular, risk-informed 
and shock-responsive policies is fundamental 
to increasing resilience of households during 
critical times. Of course, this requires adequate 
institutional capacity to capitalize on episodes of 
economic boom in order to have the finances on 
hand when the situation becomes critical. 
First and foremost, it is critical to strengthen 
the savings capacity of the economy before an 
economy slows down or contracts, so as to make 
countercyclical policies feasible in the first place. 
Commodity-dependent countries, in particular, 
would need to save more during periods of high 
commodity prices, and rely more on a set of 
existent tools such as, 
inter alia
, automatic fiscal 
stabilizers, stabilization funds, sovereign wealth 
funds, macro-prudential norms, and the like. 
However, more broadly, there should also be 
actions to raise average saving rates in order to 
more durably insulate the stability of aggregate 
demand and avoid episodes of large (though 
temporary) real exchange rate appreciations. 
By limiting the size of macroeconomic 
disequilibria and providing more breathing room, 
higher saving rates should help reduce the risks 
of falling into restrictive policies, as has been the 
case in some countries.
214
 This can be critical to 
avoid reductions in public expenditure in priority 
sectors for food security and nutrition. 
Fiscal policy also provides other instruments 
for generating funding, provided implementing 
reforms is fiscally and politically feasible. 
The available evidence
215
 indicates that most 
developing countries should enact reforms that 
simultaneously enhance the redistributive impact 
and improve the efficiency of fiscal policies. 
This would help generate additional fiscal space 
to safeguard policies aimed at protecting food 
security and nutrition at the time of slowdowns 
and downturns. On the tax side, developing 
countries may have room to increase the 
magnitude of tax revenues, and at the same time 
improve their composition (e.g. moving from 
indirect consumption taxes to direct income 
taxes). On the spending side, fiscal space could 
be generated by avoiding the fragmentation or 
inefficiency of social assistance programmes. 
The targeting of the different programmes 
could be improved as well, but this would 
entail additional costs and requirements that 
might make it unfeasible if economic conditions 
were unfavourable.
When contingency funds are available, 
programmes can be scaled up by, for example, 
providing extra support to current beneficiaries 
and/or by including new households among 
the beneficiaries. Two developing countries 
| 108 |that were able to accomplish this in the past 
are Chile and Colombia. In these cases, 
countercyclical spending was financed by 
lowering overall spending in good times and 
increasing spending and/or borrowing in times 
of economic downturns.
216
 In the case of the state 
of Maharashtra in India, on the other hand, the 
rural Employment Guarantee Scheme is financed 
with taxes collected from the relatively richer 
urban households.
In the absence of contingency funds, countries 
can prioritize social spending during economic 
crises to increase their redistributive impact and 
protect food security and nutrition. A suitable 
alternative is refocusing policy responses towards 
those households most affected by the downturn 
and, in this way, increasing the positive effect 
of policies on food security and nutrition of the 
households most in need. Another alternative 
is relying on contributions of partners and 
donors. This is the case of the HSNP in Kenya, 
although the agency in charge (the National 
Drought Management Authority) is also working 
to increase the contribution of different levels 
of government.
Fostering inclusive structural transformation to reduce economic vulnerability Section 2.2 of this report shows that the group 
of countries at higher risk of compromised 
food security and nutrition from economic 
slowdowns and downturns is mostly 
comprised of low- and lower-middle-income 
countries with high commodity dependence. 
Nevertheless, commodity dependence may be 
often unavoidable, particularly for countries 
in the first stages of development and 
structural transformation. 
These countries should use the periods of 
commodity booms to invest wisely in order 
to develop other sectors of the economy and 
foster human capital accumulation to reduce 
inequalities and increase economic resilience. 
During these periods, these countries should 
not only ensure the adequate countercyclical 
mechanisms discussed previously but also 
implement long-term development actions with 
a structural development pathway in mind.
217
 This includes safeguarding and increasing 
expenditures on essential social services that 
will increase the resilience of households, 
and decrease population vulnerability to food 
insecurity and malnutrition, as prioritized in the 
Sustainable Development Goals.
218
Balancing policies and investments for inclusive transformation
In pursuing a longer-term development 
strategy, countries will need to balance a set of 
policies and investments to achieve a structural 
transformation that also fosters poverty reduction 
and more egalitarian societies: i.e. pro-poor and 
inclusive transformation. During the early 
stages of transformation, countries need to seek 
broad-based growth that is labour intensive 
(especially for low-skilled labour), while 
investing heavily in the generation of human 
capital to enable the development of highly 
productive sectors and the diversification of 
their economies. 
It is also important to understand labour markets 
and balance the right policies to meet labour 
demand and supply. As noted earlier, export-led 
growth strategies in Latin America led to a 
more unequal income distribution, precisely 
because of insufficient employment growth in 
modern sectors. There is evidence that investing 
in human capital without sufficient creation of 
skilled jobs results in high rates of unemployment 
(particularly for youth) and skill mismatches 
in the labour market, resulting in negative 
repercussions in terms of rising inequality of 
income and opportunities, and less poverty 
reduction.
219
 On the other hand, as economies 
continue to grow, countries (like many in Asia) 
are confronted by the need to upgrade the 
skills of their labour force to catch up with the 
labour demand of newly growing industries.
220
 It is important to overcome sectoral and spatial 
mismatches in the labour market looking at all 
employment possibilities (for example, through 
green jobs, entrepreneurship, skill training, 
diversification of on-farm/off-farm activities, 
and so forth) as well as incentives for sectoral 
mobility and migration (including seasonal/
circular migration). 
Low- and lower-middle-income countries need 
to develop and expand their social protection 
| 109 |systems while they wait the required time to see 
transformation in their economies and reap the 
rewards of investing in human capital. This may 
start from social assistance programmes that not 
only guarantee food security and a minimum 
income, but also support the poorest through 
both human capital accumulation and economic 
participation in society.
221
 As countries move 
to more advanced stages of transformation, 
different types of social protection are needed 
to permanently support people™s capacity to 
manage risk across the life cycle, moving from 
social insurance towards contributory social 
security.
222 In this context, setting up measures to 
insure against setbacks to families, nations and 
regions, due to disabilities, recessions, disasters 
and disease, is another fundamental investment 
for safeguarding the progress made.
223
 Investing 
in universal health coverage and primary health 
care is another important safeguard against such 
setbacks, and protects families from damaging 
out-of-pocket healthcare costs that can push 
families into poverty. 
For transformation to be pro-poor and inclusive, 
in addition to investments, key reforms are 
often needed to enable more equal distribution 
of resources and access to social services. 
Examples of past reforms of this kind, and their 
positive impacts, have been seen in several 
countries,
224
 including the land reforms that 
transferred more land to poor farmers in the 
Republic of Korea and Taiwan Province of China 
(1940s to 1960s), and in Viet Nam (in the late 
1980s and 1990s). China™s establishment of the 
household responsibility system (1979) that held 
farmers responsible for the losses and profits of 
their agricultural activity boosted production and 
also massively reduced poverty in that country. 
The expansion of universal health insurance in 
Thailand (2000s) helped increase human capital, 
thus facilitating the participation of the poor in 
the economy. 
The example of Costa Rica shows that moving 
away from commodity dependency is indeed 
possible. As noted earlier, this country has 
diversified its exports through trade reforms 
and an export-led growth strategy. Starting in 
the 1980s, it set up a number of initiatives to 
stimulate the diversification of the economy, 
including financial incentives (tax exemptions, 
subsidies, etc.) leading to the development 
of so-called ﬁnon-traditional exportsﬂ (i.e. 
pineapples, cut flowers, shrimps and textiles), 
which already in the 1990s had outpaced 
traditional exports (notably coffee and bananas). 
At the same time, food-related manufacturing 
developed and export-processing zones helped 
attract foreign direct investment inflows in 
the manufacturing and high-tech sectors. 
Growth in the services sector also contributed to 
the establishment of the strong tourism industry 
that exists today.
225
 These transformations 
bore fruit to a large extent also because 
large investments had been made in human 
development. Costa Rica™s education system has 
been a pioneer among Latin American countries, 
and has played an important role in the country™s 
economic performance and in maintaining its 
democratic stability.
226
 The role of agricultural development is also 
key for reducing food-import dependence and 
for achieving structural transformation in both 
low- and middle-income countries.
227
 Countries 
with more suitable agricultural potential could 
invest to acquire a certain level of national 
staple production in order to lower food-import 
dependency.
228
 At the same time, however, these 
countries should also seek to develop other 
sectors, capitalizing on initial investments in 
agriculture and its related industries. For ﬁlate 
transformingﬂ low-income countries, where 
industrialization is lagging, agro-industrial 
development and strengthened ruralŒurban 
linkages have large potential for improving 
livelihoods and contributing to the eradication 
of poverty.
229
 Investing to diversify and better 
integrate small-scale agriculture into markets 
in low-income countries can lead to positive 
outcomes in terms of income generation (
Box 19
), 
which can potentially reduce poverty, food 
insecurity and malnutrition. Encouraging more 
diverse diets and enabling the accessibility 
of more diverse foods can help lower demand 
for food staples,
230
 while stimulating the 
diversification of agricultural products, including 
that of local foods.
231
 Finally, designing policies 
and interventions with a territorial perspective, 
recognizing the linkages of rural/agricultural 
areas with small cities/towns and larger cities, 
can lead to more dynamic growth of economic 
opportunities, including beyond agriculture.
232
   »| 110 |Developing agro-industrial value chains opens up 
market opportunities for small-scale farmers,
1 particularly in commodity-dependent countries such as 
Sao Tome and Principe, and Senegal. Sao Tome and 
Principe exports cocoa, and Senegal oil fuel, fishery 
products and gold; both are highly dependent on food 
imports.
2 Commodity dependence makes them more 
vulnerable to commodity price shocks. Efforts by these 
countries to develop a sustainable and diversified 
agricultural sector in recent years have included 
policies and programmes to increase access to 
markets for small-scale producers (who make up the 
majority of these countries™ workforces) while 
improving the quality of agricultural production.3Senegal™s agricultural sector accounts for 
17.5 percent of its GDP.
4 The country has experienced 
an economic slowdown since 2006, with its 
agricultural sector facing several shocks that have 
weakened its full potential. To address this challenge, 
the Government stepped up investment in agriculture 
to more than 10 percent of GDP annually beginning in 
2009, and committed to transforming the agricultural 
sector.
5 The Agricultural Value Chains Support 
Project (PAFA), for example, was implemented in the 
Groundnut Basin, a region that has suffered from 
high levels of poverty and food insecurity following 
a decline in global groundnut prices. The project 
aimed to improve the rural livelihoods and incomes 
of 16˚035˚households by integrating small-scale 
producers into profitable and diversified value chains, 
and also to improve access to markets by establishing 
commercialization contracts with market operators. 
The project was successful in increasing production 
commercialization of crops that had mainly been 
grown for domestic consumption. It also helped farmers 
to transition away from groundnut production, by 
investing in poultry rearing and vegetable growing.
6 Evidence from an impact assessment of the project 
found that as a result of PAFA, crop income increased 
by 48 percent, and total income increased by 
11.3˚percent, within those households participating in 
the project.7 The experience of Sao Tome and Principe 
shows that inclusive rural transformation can 
also be achieved through strengthening linkages 
between farms and markets, while also achieving 
positive outcomes in food security and nutrition. 
The Government launched the Participatory 
Smallholder Agriculture and Artisanal Fisheries 
Development Programme (PAPAFPA) in 2003, 
followed by the Smallholder Commercial Agriculture 
Project (PAPAC) in 2015. This helped promote the 
commercialization of organic, high quality cocoa, 
coffee and pepper by creating farmer cooperatives 
and establishing family plantations to increase 
sales to domestic and export markets. Results from 
the impact assessment of these programmes 
demonstrated positive and significant impacts on 
agricultural incomes (an increase of 46 percent, 
77˚percent of which was derived from cocoa, coffee 
and pepper); and on dietary diversity (an increase 
of 5 percent). Another result of the project was an 
increase in take-up of organic certification among the 
participants of the project.

.BOX 19BOOSTING SMALL-SCALE FARMING FOR DIVERSIFICATION AND MARKET INTEGRATION 
IN SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE, AND SENEGAL| 111 |Actions that foster agricultural development 
could, at the same time, lower the negative 
impacts of economic slowdowns and downturns 
on food security and nutrition; however, 
agricultural transformation does not always 
necessarily meet food-security and nutrition 
objectives. Besides the pro-poor nature 
of transformation, the positive effects of 
agricultural transformation on food security and 
nutrition will depend on the type of commodities 
and the quality of food that is generated under 
this process, and on fostering better access for 
everyone to more nutritious foods.
233
 The overlap 
of policies for food security and nutrition with 
others seeking to foster economic development, 
particularly those with a focus on poverty 
reduction, is further discussed in the last section. 
Finally, an important point is that mobilizing 
investments for achieving economic 
diversification requires effective political 
leadership to address the related issues of 
governance and the political economy of 
economic and social transformation. For example, 
investment in human development in 
commodity-dependent countries, which are often 
low-income countries, tends to be low.
234
 This is 
explained not only by lack of resources, but also 
by the level of democratization of governments 
and capacity of government institutions. 
When democratization and institutional capacity 
are lacking, it may result in some forms of 
rent-seeking that impede economic growth (or 
prevent countries from fully taking advantage 
of commodity price booms) and create further 
social inequalities. 
Making the most of trade for food security and nutritionWhile economic and export diversification and 
domestic market development are necessary to 
reduce the external vulnerability that challenges 
food security and nutrition, import diversification 
is also needed as part of a larger transformation, 
including in food systems, towards healthier 
diets. Therefore, international trade as a whole, 
and the global, regional and unilateral policies 
that shape it, also need to feature prominently 
in the minds of policymakers when promoting 
this transformation. 
Global, regional and unilateral trade policies are 
more important than ever. It was highlighted 
earlier that a number of universal policies can 
help stabilize food prices, including restrictions 
on exports of staple food items, or import-tariff 
cuts. The latter can also boost domestic 
production of food in the medium and long term. 
However, the importance of trade policies extends 
beyond their role in stabilizing food prices and 
boosting food production. These policies need to 
be carefully crafted to be among the triggers of a 
sustainable transformation.
World agricultural and food markets are 
increasingly integrated. This is largely driven by 
trade and investment policy, which influences 
food systems at global, regional and national 
levels, shaping aspects of food environments 
such as food availability, prices, quality, and 
food-security and nutrition outcomes.
235
Broadly speaking, trade is good for food security. 
By moving food from surplus to deficit countries, 
trade can ensure the availability and variety 
of food, and promote access and stable prices. 
Trade can also promote dietary diversity, which 
is recognized as essential for adequate nutrient 
intake and human health. For some countries, 
especially low-income ones, diets reflect the 
diversity of foods produced, such as in Nepal.
236
 At the same time, trade is associated with the 
ﬁnutrition transitionﬂ where diets become richer 
in animal sourced foods, and highly-processed 
foods often high in fat, sugar and salt are more 
widely available as average income increases. 
For example, Mexico™s exposure to food imports 
from the United States of America explains four 
percent of the rise in obesity prevalence among 
Mexican women between 1988 and 2012.
237
 In spite of the benefits, policymakers still need 
to be careful that trade policies and agreements 
are not detrimental to nutrition objectives Œ 
especially given that these policies rarely, if 
ever, consider healthy diets as their underlying 
rationale.
238
 This is quite important, considering 
that global trade in food and agricultural 
commodities has increased significantly, so 
there is potential for it to contribute to nutrition 
objectives, as noted above. This will not only 
require considering the impacts of trade policy 
on nutrition, but also enhanced coherence

foods available to populations and foster demand for 
healthier food commodities. Nonetheless, trade policy 
rarely, if ever, considers healthy diets as its underlying 
rationale. Thus, rather than driving healthy diets, trade 
is often associated with forms of malnutrition.
1 As depicted in the figure below, trade of agricultural 
and food products is among the key factors mediating 
between trade policy and the food environment. 
Other key factors include foreign direct investment and 
domestic policies addressing nutrition goals.Global trade in food and agricultural commodities has increased significantly in the past half century, both 
in terms of the quantity and value of commodities traded.
2 Also, foreign direct investment (FDI) has been on the rise, partly as a result of trade agreements. FDI in food and 
agriculture is a way of ﬁdomesticatingﬂ the food supply and deepening the capacity of the national food system, without increasing food imports. The health impacts of 
these changes are mixed and dependent on various factors, including whether the food products traded or the type of food-related FDI is healthy or unhealthy. 
FDI has been shown to be a key driver of growth in sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption.
3Increased trade in food and agricultural 
commodities has been accompanied by significant 
changes in the governance of trade. Increasingly, 
trade agreements are negotiated outside of the 
multilateral system of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO). The trade agreements negotiated both 
within the WTO system and outside of the WTO 
system are often characterized by power imbalances 
between participating countries and can be 
strongly influenced by the interests of multinational 
companies. Particularly problematic are regional 
and bilateral trade agreements that include 
unprecedented clauses, particularly strong investor 
protections with potentially deep impacts on domestic 
policy space.4It is critical for country decision makers to 
consider the impacts of trade policy on nutrition, 
and to enhance coherence between trade policy and 
action on nutrition. However, achieving such policy 
coherence will require collaboration and coordination 
between two different stakeholder groups Œ from both 
the ﬁtradeﬂ and ﬁnutritionﬂ communities Œ including 
agreement on policy objectives. This poses a significant 
challenge given the different worldviews, institutional 
| 113 |BOX 20(CONTINUED)norms, interests and power imbalances between the 
two communities.5 However, the positive news is that there have 
already been some agreements negotiated that point 
in the right direction. At the Second International 
Conference on Nutrition (ICN2),6 164 Members of 
FAO and WHO agreed upon and recognized the 
important impact of trade on nutrition, recommending 
two policy actions to improve availability and access 
of the food supply through trade, to ensure that trade 
agreements do not have a negative impact on the right 
to adequate food in other countries. Further, building 
on the ICN2 commitments, the UN Decade of Action 
on Nutrition7 identified six cross-cutting action areas, 
including: ﬁtrade and investment for improved 
nutritionﬂ, focusing on identification of opportunities 
to achieve global food security and nutrition targets 
through trade and investment policies; and the 
implementation of the Principles for Responsible 
Investments in Agriculture and Food Systems.8 Trade 
and investment are of critical importance in supporting 
healthier diets and contribute to the achievement of 
SDG 2 (ending hunger and reducing malnutrition in all 
its forms by 2030). 
1 The food environment can be defined as ﬁthe interface that mediates people™s food acquisition and consumption within the wider food system. It encompasses external dimensions 
such as the availability, prices, vendor and product properties and promotional information; and personal dimensions such as the accessibility, affordability, convenience and 
desirability of food sources and productsﬂ from

between trade policy and action on nutrition. 
Achieving such policy coherence depends on 
strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration and 
coordination, and improving governance of 
policymaking processes at global, regional and 
country levels (
Box 20
). 
Multisectoral policies for sustaining escapes from food insecurity and malnutrition,  with a focus on poverty and inequalitiesAs seen earlier in the report, the impact of 
economic slowdowns and downturns on food 
security and nutrition cannot be separated from 
poverty and inequality issues. The interactions 
between poverty and hunger and malnutrition 
  »| 114 |form a vicious trap, where poverty is a cause 
of hunger and where a lack of adequate and 
proper nutrition is itself an underlying cause of 
poverty.
239
 However, poverty reduction strategies 
and policies are not sufficient to reduce hunger 
and malnutrition, including in the context of 
economic slowdowns and downturns, particularly 
if important inequalities prevail. This last 
section looks at how multisectoral policies for 
food security and nutrition are linked to policies 
for the reduction of poverty and inequality. 
It points to the importance of reinforcing these 
with specific actions, focusing particularly 
on nutrition.
How does poverty reduction play a role and what 
policies can be strengthened? The disconnect between poverty alleviation and 
improvements in food security and nutrition 
has recently become more apparent, as seen 
in Section 2.3. Several countries have made 
significant progress in reducing poverty; 
however, similar progress in food security and 
nutrition has not been realized. 
Of course, the relationship between poverty and 
food security and nutrition is also complicated by 
the different ways in which these two phenomena 
are measured, and by the limited research that 
has addressed both in a comparative manner. 
Moreover, vulnerability to poverty and to food 
insecurity and malnutrition is also defined 
through different concepts; thus, in practice, it 
may be difficult to identify which phenomenon 
manifests first in a given situation in order to 
understand causal relationships.
240
 For example, 
poor households may go hungry after a period 
of utilizing and depleting their resource base, 
showing poverty and vulnerability to food 
insecurity, but not actual undernourishment. 
Similarly, food may suddenly become physically 
unavailable to a household due to a idiosyncratic 
shock, even for non-poor households with the 
resources to buy nutritious food. Higher incomes 
can also increase food consumption, but this does 
not guarantee positive outcomes in nutrition.
241
 From a policy perspective, these complexities 
have important implications. While similar 
policy instruments may apply in some cases 
for achieving both poverty reduction and food 
security, the specificities of food security and 
nutrition should be emphasized and addressed 
more comprehensively.
242
 Table 12
 helps explain 
the ways in which policies and actions for 
reducing poverty can follow a more coherent 
multisectoral approach to food security and 
nutrition, using the four pillars of food security. 
The table also highlights constraints that may 
prevent the poverty reduction policies from 
helping to improve food security and nutrition. 
Sociocultural factors may play an important 
role for the feasibility of all these multisectoral 
policies; however, they can be rather context 
specific. The table, nonetheless, identifies some 
of the cultural characteristics that generally act 
as constraints to achieving outcomes in food 
security and nutrition.
Overcoming the constraints listed in 
Table 12
 requires looking at coherent integrated policies 
for poverty reduction and eradication of food 
insecurity and malnutrition. However, because 
the relationship between these phenomena may 
be bidirectional, actions towards sustainable 
food security and nutrition should also consider 
a long-term view of poverty reduction and 
economic growth, as well as resilience through 
preparedness mechanisms and shock-responsive 
social protection.
A number of countries have been strengthening 
food security and nutrition outcomes in 
their poverty-reduction interventions. 
Social protection (social assistance in particular) 
can help address some of the economic and social 
determinants of malnutrition, including when 
targeting all nutritionally vulnerable populations 
to food insecurity and malnutrition (including 
infants and young children, pregnant and 
lactating women, people living with HIV/AIDS, 
older people, and those who are sick) or when 
ensuring that appropriate linkages with health, 
education and agriculture are strategically made 
for food security and nutrition. 
Nutrition-sensitive social protection (NSSP) can 
be made possible by fostering policy coherence 
across these sectors, and by facilitating 
programmes that integrate different components 
like social assistance (e.g. cash transfers), access 
to nutrition education, health services, and 
nutrition-sensitive agriculture.

since 2013, Lesotho has been working to

MULTISECTORAL POLICIES FOR REDUCING POVERTY, AND THE CONSTRAINTS THAT MUST BE OVERCOME 
 TO IMPROVE FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION Poverty reduction policies addressing each food security pillar
Constraints to achieving sustainable outcomes  in food security and nutritionPhysical availability of food* Promoting poor farmers™ productivity increases the 
production and the availability of food for the poor at 
the national level; however, this depends on the potential 
of the production frontier, type of crop and the market 
where agricultural production is sold. 
 Facilitating trade of food products allows poor consumers 
to access food commodities at lower prices. Supporting poor farmers™ food production may not 
provide enough food supply at national level because of 
market failures or lack of supply response. Additional policies in relation to food imports, trade and 
investments (see Box 20), utilization of food production, 
and available stocks for emergency situations to supply 
safety net mechanisms may not be in place. 
Economic and physical access to food** Several poverty reduction policies aim to increase 
economic inclusion of the poor, which also expand their 
access to food and to productive resources (including 
land and water) and markets; and provide support to 
increase productivity and develop other income-generating opportunities. 
 Ensuring a minimum income can be achieved through: 
social protection systems, work promotion programmes; 
supporting agricultural production of poor farmers and 
their access to markets; and more broadly, rural 
development programmes, investment in employment 
generation, and developing entrepreneurship. Supporting long-term investments in children™s education 
and school feeding, and ensuring their access to 
appropriate care and health services, also helps to 
expand their future economic prospects and reduce the 
intergenerational transmission of poverty. 
 Basic infrastructure and roads, particularly in rural 
areas, and the development of markets in urban and 
peri-urban areas facilitates physical access to food. 
 Cultural characteristics related to gender and social 
inequalities, as well as other behavioural aspects, could 
affect equal access to food by all members in the 
household. They could also affect the prioritization of 
food, particularly of quality food, over other expenditures. 
These factors affect both poor and non-poor households. 
 Supporting women™s economic empowerment, as part of 
poverty reduction efforts, may present trade-offs in terms 
of their time for breastfeeding, caring for infants and 
young children, and food preparation. Poverty-reduction 
programmes often fail to address these constraints and 
provide additional support, including working with the 
whole household to reconsider existing gender roles and 
share household responsibilities; this can compromise 
women's nutritional well-being as well as that of their 
families. 
 Raising the profile of traditional foods and ensuring their 
affordability would also require that enhanced support is 
provided to poor farmers.
 In urban areas, fostering more enabling environments for 
healthy food choices can be supported by zoning 
policies and social support systems, including safe 
redistribution of unsold food for charities to improve 
access to healthy foods; promotion of urban agriculture; 
and shorter food supply chains that reconnect cities to 
their zones of influence. 
 In the absence of universal health coverage, poor health 
and/or catastrophic out-of-pocket healthcare costs can 
undermine achievement or a minimum income or reduce 
expenditure available for food.Food utilization*** Basic investments in the quality of diets; quality of health; 
education; and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) 
can improve childcare and feeding practices, maternal 
nutrition, dietary choices of consumers and food 
preparation. Together with improvements in information on the quality 
of diets, these can help prevent diseases which can affect 
food utilization and exacerbate malnutrition. 
 More nutrition-specific interventions that address the 
immediate causes of malnutrition, and some of its 
underlying causes (e.g. lack of nutrition education) are 
often not seen as part of poverty reduction strategies.
 The food accessible to the poor, but also the non-poor, 
may be suboptimal for improved nutrition and health. 
Micronutrient deficiencies are often more prevalent 
among the poor. 
 There are other issues related to the microbiome and its 
impact on food and agriculture, which simultaneously 
affect human nutrition. 
 Women™s lack of empowerment and intra-household 
gender relations, and women™s lack of knowledge and 
understanding of nutritional issues jeopardize utilization.| 116 |improve the resilience and food and income 
security of the extreme poor by creating 
synergies between social protection and 
agriculture interventions. Lesotho™s innovative 
approach complements the existing national 
cash transfer programme, the Child Grant 
Programme (CGP), with home gardening and 
nutrition kits and training, paying special 
attention to those households most affected 
by drought, which are not only poor but also 
vulnerable to food insecurity. Rigorous impact 
evaluations of the CGP and of additional 
interventions have provided strong evidence 
that, when all these elements are combined, 
a stronger impact in reducing poverty and 
nutrition is simultaneously achieved.
244
However, these efforts will not be enough to 
protect food security and nutrition, particularly 
during periods of economic slowdowns and 
downturns, if the multisectoral approach does 
not address determinants of nutrition such as 
food security, care, health, and water, sanitation 
and hygiene (WASH). The health system is 
the primary channel through which to address 
some of these determinants.
245
 In recent years, 
Ethiopia, Uganda and the United Republic of 
Tanzania have all been working to scale up their 
nutrition interventions in this regard. These three 
countries have focused on essential maternal, 
TABLE 12 
(CONTINUED)infant and young child nutrition during the first 
1˜000 days. In Ethiopia, local evidence convinced 
policymakers of the need to address anaemia 
among adolescent girls. In Uganda, participatory 
district assessments brought stakeholders 
together around evidence-informed nutrition 
actions. And in the United Republic of Tanzania, 
district-level investments for nutrition increased 
when capacity was developed for planning and 
budgeting.
246
 Universal interventions for food 
security and nutrition like these are necessary in 
order to avoid leaving out not only the poor but 
also several other, non-poor populations who 
may be at risk of food insecurity. 
Economic and social inequalities impede progress in 
food security and nutritionInequality can limit opportunities for 
households to escape poverty, food insecurity 
and malnutrition. Because of income inequality, 
the poor are not able to benefit from economic 
booms Œ as they disproportionally accrue less 
income compared to others Œ and nor do they 
have sufficient income streams to better cope 
during episodes of economic difficulty. But, as 
noted earlier, finding sustained escapes from 
food insecurity, malnutrition and poverty also 
depends on having adequate access to basic 
services, in particular: care, health and WASH. 
Unfortunately, there are still great inequalities 
Poverty reduction policies addressing each food security pillar
Constraints to achieving sustainable outcomes  in food security and nutritionStability of the other three dimensions over time**** Actions to sustain economic growth and foster 
preparedness mechanisms can help improve resilience in 
the face of economic and climate-related shocks more 
broadly. 
 Shock-responsive social protection systems can expand 
cash transfers (conditional or unconditional depending 
on the existing level of institutionality), cash for work or 
food for work programmes when covariate or intrinsic 
shocks occur.
 School feeding programmes and insurance mechanisms 
can enable the stability of food security over time. 
 In some cases, there is an absence of nutrition-sensitive 
interventions (including in social sector services and 
social protection programmes) which help address some 
of the underlying and basic causes of malnutrition by 
incorporating nutrition goals and actions from a wide 
range of sectors. In some cases the essential nutrition actions are not 
accessible to people in need.NOTES: 
* Food availability addresses the ﬁsupply sideﬂ of food security and is determined by the level of food production, stock levels and net trade. ** An adequate supply of 
food at the national or international level does not in itself guarantee household level food security. Concerns about insufficient food access have resulted in a greater policy 
focus on incomes, expenditure, markets and prices in achieving food security objectives. *** Utilization is commonly understood as the way the body makes the most of various 
nutrients in the food. Sufficient energy and nutrient intake by individuals are the result of good care and feeding practices, food preparation, diversity of the diet and intra-
household distribution of food. Combined with good biological utilization of food consumed, this determines the nutritional status of individuals. **** Even if your food intake is 
adequate today, you are still considered to be food insecure if you have inadequate access to food on a periodic basis, risking a deterioration of your nutritional status. Adverse 
weather conditions, political instability, or economic factors (unemployment, rising food prices) may have an impact on your food security status.

access of these basic services. The reasons for 
the existing gaps need to be further analysed, 
including from a perspective of political economy 
and corruption prevention. 
The stark inequalities that are observed between 
urban and rural areas in some developing 
countries demonstrate how processes of 
economic growth and transformation can be 
unequal. Poverty reduction and development 
efforts need to focus more on raising 
agricultural productivity and rural incomes, 
generating wider employment opportunities 
and integrating rural areas more effectively 
into mechanisms of national economic 
development. In doing so, it is important to 
conceive rural development as an endeavour 
that involves other actions beyond agriculture. 
In the twenty-first century, rurality cannot be 
seen to be synonymous with decline, as this 
view risks neglecting essential opportunities 
for economic growth and social development. 
The revalorization of rural spaces is needed, 
and with that, the adoption of rural policies that 
leverage regional assets rather than exclusively 
pursuing a compensatory approach.
247
 At the 
same time, there is a need to increase the 
resilience and address the food security and 
nutrition needs of urban residents living in 
extreme poverty, including by creating healthier 
food environments and by ensuring that the 
urban poor are able to access WASH services 
from which, despite better urban provision, they 
are often excluded.
Often, inequality is nested within the household, 
with gender inequalities still persistent across all 
regions, and in both developed and developing 
countries. As seen in the previous sections and 
in Section 1.1 in Part 1, women are at higher 
risk of undernourishment than men, and women 
of reproductive age tend to be more vulnerable 
to food insecurity and malnutrition. In order 
to reduce gender inequalities, more dedicated 
and comprehensive policies and development 
approaches are required that specifically target 
women™s economic empowerment and nutrition. 
Integrated approaches for women could include 
access to reproductive health services and 
nutrition services, care services, skills training 
and access to employment, maternity protection 
and social protection. In addition to assets 
and access to basic services, these approaches 
should directly address gender inequalities by 
focusing on the people involved: understanding 
who they want to be, what they want to do, and 
how they can achieve their goals using a joint 
vision and practical strategy.
248
 At the same time, 
this requires understanding human behaviour, 
fostering community awareness, and identifying 
effective incentives for women to access services 
and support. 
Beyond gender inequalities, other social 
inequalities derived from discrimination 
and exclusion of population groups based 
on ethnicity, caste or religion Œ also noted 
earlier Œ hamper any potential advancement 
in ensuring food security and good nutrition. 
Social discrimination and exclusion of these 
population groups can be reversed only 
through policies and social mobilization to 
address the multiple challenges they face. 
There are a number of possible actions to this 
end, including: legal, regulatory and policy 
frameworks to promote social inclusion; 
national public expenditure; improving access 
to and adequacy of public services (sometimes 
exclusively targeted to these population 
groups); empowering institutions, their 
organizational capacity and their participation 
in decision-making processes; increasing 
accountability to protect human rights; and 
working to gradually change discriminatory 
attitudes and behaviours.

 2.5
  CONCLUSIONSThis year™s report continues to signal the 
significant challenges that remain in the 
fight against hunger, food insecurity and 
malnutrition in all its forms. Part 2 calls for 
bolder actions to address these challenges in the 
face of economic slowdowns and downturns. 
The latest global economic prospects warn of 
slowing and stalled economic growth in many 
countries, including emerging and developing 
economies. Episodes of financial stress, 
elevated trade tensions, declining commodity 
prices, and tightening financial conditions 
are all contributing to these increasingly 
grim prospects. 
| 118 |Part 2 has presented new evidence 
confirming that:
 hunger has been on the rise for many 
countries where the economy has slowed 
or contracted Œ strikingly, the majority of 
these are not low-income countries, but 
middle-income countries; 
 economic shocks are prolonging and worsening 
the severity of acute food insecurity, in food 
crisis countries; 
 economic slowdowns tend to be sharper and 
economic contractions deeper and longer 
lasting for commodity-dependent countries; 
and 
 economic events generally have a harsher 
effect on food security and nutrition when 
extreme poverty and inequalities are greater. 
Inequalities in income and in access to basic 
services and assets, as well as social exclusion 
and marginalization of groups, are preventing 
large numbers of people from reaping benefits 
during times of strong economic growth, or from 
coping adequately during periods of economic 
slowdowns or downturns. The new evidence in 
Part 2 points to the fact that these slowdowns 
and downturns disproportionally undermine 
food security and nutrition where inequalities are 
greater, particularly in middle-income countries. 
Income and wealth inequalities are also closely 
associated with undernutrition, while more 
complex inequality patterns are associated with 
obesity. Therefore, reducing these inequalities 
must be a primary goal, either as a means to 
improving food security and nutrition, or as an 
outcome of doing so.
The report calls for action on two fronts to 
safeguard food security and nutrition from 
economic slowdowns and downturns. In the short 
term, countries need to protect incomes so as to 
counteract economic adversity. To enhance the 
contingency mechanisms and financial capacity 
that policymakers need to respond, it is critical to 
strengthen savings capacity when the economy is 
growing, using available instruments (automatic 
fiscal stabilizers, stabilization funds, sovereign 
wealth funds, macro-prudential norms, and 
the like), so as to make countercyclical policies 
feasible. Policies may include targeted social 
protection programmes, including conditional 
or unconditional cash transfers and school 
feeding; public works programmes that help 
reduce unemployment; or policies aimed at 
stabilizing food prices, and protecting incomes 
from damaging out-of-pocket healthcare costs 
by ensuring full coverage of essential health 
services. The potential unintended consequences 
for nutrition must be carefully considered 
throughout, and cuts to essential social services, 
including health, must be avoided at all costs. 
In the longer term, countries need to invest 
wisely during periods of economic booms to 
reduce economic vulnerabilities and build 
capacity to withstand and quickly recover when 
economic turmoil erupts. This requires balancing 
a set of policies and investments to achieve 
an inclusive structural transformation that 
diversifies the economy away from commodity 
dependence, while also fostering poverty 
reduction and more egalitarian societies.
This includes transforming agriculture and food 
systems such that the type of commodities and 
the quality of food that they produce contribute 
to improving access to more nutritious foods 
for all. Measures to increase dietary diversity 
and to create healthier food environments are 
required to prevent economic slowdowns or 
downturns from undermining the nutritional 
quality of diets. Policymakers must ensure 
that facilitating trade access does not have 
unintended negative consequences for food 
security and nutrition in sectors that would in 
principle be affected by the increase in trade 
access. Integrating food security and nutrition 
concerns into poverty reduction efforts, while 
increasing synergies between poverty reduction 
and hunger eradication, must also be part of 
the transformation. 
Ensuring that this transformation is pro-poor 
and inclusive will not be possible by focusing on 
economic growth alone: it will require tackling 
existing inequalities at all levels, through 
multisectoral policies that keep these inequalities 
as the central focus. Ultimately, this kind of 
transformation will only materialize if policies 
effectively strengthen the economic resilience 
of countries to safeguard food security and 
nutrition at those times when the economy slows 
or contracts.

TABLE A1.1 
(CONTINUED)1 Regional estimates are included when more than 50˜percent 
of population is covered. To reduce the margin of error, 
estimates are presented as three-year averages.
2 FAO estimate of the percentage of people in the total 
population living in households where at least one adult has 
been found to be food insecure. To reduce the impact of 
year-to-year
 sampling variability, estimates are presented as 
three-year
 averages.
3 Country-level results are presented only for those countries 
for which estimates are based on official national data 
 (see note c) or as provisional estimates, based on FAO data 
collected through the Gallup World Poll, for countries whose 
national relevant authorities provided permission to publish 
them. 
Note that consent to publish does not necessarily imply 
validation of the estimate by the 
national authorities involved
 and that the estimate is subject to revision as soon as suitable 
data from official national sources are available
. Global, 
regional and subregional aggregates reflect data collected in 
approximately 150 countries.
4 For regional estimates, values correspond to the model 
predicted estimate for the year 2018. For countries, the latest 
data available from 2013 to 2018 are used.
5 For regional estimates, values correspond to the model 
predicted estimate for the year 2012. For countries, the latest 
data available from 2005 to 2012 are used.
6 Regional estimates are included when more than 50 percent 
of population is covered. For countries, the latest data 
available from 2005 to 2012 are used.
 7 Regional estimates are included when more than 50 percent 
of population is covered. For countries, the latest data 
available from 2013 to 2018 are used.
* Wasting, stunting, and overweight under 5 years of age and 
low birthweight regional aggregates exclude Japan
.a. Consecutive low population coverage; interpret with caution.
b. 
The Central Agency for Public Mobilization & Statistics 
(CAPMAS) reports an estimate of severe food insecurity of 
1.3˜percent for 2015, based on HIECS data, using the WFP 
consolidated approach for reporting indicators of food security. 
Note that the two estimates are not directly comparable due to 
different definitions of ""severe food insecurity"".
c. 
Based on official national data.

The Government of Ireland reports estimates of the 
""Proportion of the population at risk of food poverty"" produced 
by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and Economic and Social 
Research Institute (ESRI) as part of the Survey on Income and 
Social Conditions (SILC) 2015, as a proxy for SDG indicator

 STATISTICAL TABLES 
UNDERNOURISHMENT
Definition:
 Undernourishment is defined as the 
condition of an individual whose habitual food 
consumption is insufficient to provide, on 
average, the amount of dietary energy required to 
maintain a normal, active, healthy life.
How it is reported:
 The indicator is reported as a 
prevalence and is denominated as ﬁprevalence 
of undernourishmentﬂ (PoU), which is an 
estimate of the percentage of individuals in 
the total population that are in a condition 
of undernourishment. National estimates 
are reported as three-year moving averages, 
to control for the low reliability of some of 
the underlying parameters, due for example 
to difficulties in capturing the year-to-year 
variation in food commodity stocks, one of the 
components of the annual food balance sheets, 
for which complete, reliable information is very 
scarce. Regional and global aggregates, on the 
other hand, are reported as annual estimates, 
on account of the fact that possible estimation 
errors are expected not to be correlated 
across countries.
Methodology:
 To compute an estimate of the 
prevalence of undernourishment in a population, 
the probability distribution of habitual dietary 
energy intake levels (expressed in kcal per 
person per day) for the average individual is 
modelled as a parametric probability density 
function (pdf), 
f(x)
. The indicator is obtained 
as the cumulative probability that the habitual 
dietary energy intake (
x) is below the minimum 
dietary energy requirements (MDER) (i.e., the 
lowest limit of the range of energy requirements 
for the population™s representative average 
individual) as in the formula below:
PoU = 
˜x<MDER
 f(x|˚)dx,
where 
˚ is a vector of parameters that 
characterizes the pdf. The distribution is assumed 
to be lognormal, and thus fully characterized 
by only two parameters: the mean dietary 
energy consumption (DEC), and its coefficient 
of variation (CV). In a few exceptional cases, a 
three-parameter skew-normal or skew-lognormal 
distribution is considered.
1Data sources:
 Different data sources are used to 
estimate the different parameters of the model.
Minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER): 
Human energy 
requirements for an individual in a given sex/age 
class are determined on the basis of normative 
requirements for basic metabolic rate (BMR) per 
kilogram of body mass, multiplied by the ideal 
weights that a healthy person of that class may 
have, given his or her height, and then multiplied 
by a coefficient of physical activity level (PAL) to 
take into account physical activity.
2 Given that 
both healthy BMIs and PALs vary among active 
and healthy individuals of the same sex and age, 
a range
 of energy requirements applies to each 
sex and age group of the population. The MDER 
for the average individual in the population, 
that is the parameter used in the PoU formula, 
is obtained as the weighted average of the lower 
bounds of the energy requirement ranges for 
each sex and age group, using the shares of the 
population in each sex and age group as weights.
Information on the population structure by sex 
and age is available for most countries in the 
world and for each year from the UN Department 
of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) 
Population Prospects, revised every two years. 
This edition of SOFI uses the 2017 revision of the 
World Population Prospects.
3Information on the median height in each sex 
and age group for a given country is derived from 
a recent demographic and health survey (DHS) 
or from other surveys that collect anthropometry 
data on children and adults. Even if such surveys 
do not refer to the same year for which the 
PoU is estimated, the impact of possible small 
intervening changes in median heights over 
the years on PoU estimates are expected to 
be negligible.
ANNEX 1
| 148 |Dietary energy consumption (DEC), coefficient of variation 
(CV) and skewness (Skew): 
When reliable data on 
food consumption are available from nationally 
representative household surveys that collect 
information on food consumption (such as, 
Living Standard Measurement Surveys or 
Household Incomes and Expenditure Surveys), 
the parameters that describe the distribution of 
average daily dietary energy requirement in the 
population can be estimated directly.
However, only very few countries conduct such 
surveys on an annual basis. This necessitates 
estimating them indirectly, or imputing them 
for the years when no suitable survey data 
are available. In such cases, DEC values are 
estimated from the dietary energy supply (DES) 
reported in the Food Balance Sheets (FBS), 
compiled by FAO for most countries in the world 
(see 
http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/en
). 
This year, the FBS series were updated for the 
following 53 countries with the largest number 
of undernourished people, bringing them up to 
date through 2017: Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, 
Bangladesh, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), 
Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central 
African Republic, Chad, China (mainland), 
Colombia, Congo, C
ôte d™Ivoire, Democratic 
People™s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic 
of the Congo, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, 
Guinea, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, 
Madagascar, Malawi, Mexico, Mozambique, 
Myanmar, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, 
Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, 
South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syrian Arab 
Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, Uganda, United 
Republic of Tanzania, Uzbekistan, Venezuela 
(Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, Yemen, 
Zambia and Zimbabwe.
In addition, FBS series for 28 European 
high-income countries were updated 
through 2016.
FBS are of no use to estimate the CV, as they 
provide no information on the 
distribution
 of 
food consumption within a population. In the 
past FAO had made attempts at estimating the 
CV as a function of macroeconomic variables, 
such as per capita GDP, inequality in income 
(captured by the Gini index) and an index of 
the relative price of food.
4 However, the ability 
to correctly project the CV of habitual food 
consumption in a population with such model 
is questionable, due to the sparsity of data on 
the Gini index and to reservations on the way 
in which the index of the relative price of food 
is compiled. It was therefore decided to revert 
to a simpler (and arguably more robust) method 
to linearly interpolate values of the CVs in the 
years between surveys. The main drawback of 
such modelling choice is that, when only one 
survey is available over the monitored period, 
the resulting value of the CV is kept constant 
over the entire period of assessment, and in 
any case from the year of last available survey 
up to the year 2015. Possible changes over 
time in the ability to access food by different 
strata of the population that are not fully 
reflected in changes in the average national 
food consumption are therefore not captured in 
PoU estimates.
PoU projections for 2018: 
Using the methods 
described above, PoU estimates are produced 
for all countries for which reliable FBS data are 
available up to 2017.
To generate national level three-year averages for 
2016
Œ18 and annual values at regional and global 
level in 2018, projections are needed.
As in the past editions of SOFI, PoU estimates 
for the current year are obtained by separately 
projecting each of the model™s parameters, and by 
applying the PoU formula presented above to the 
projected parameters.
Projection of the DEC.
 The latest available data 
from national food balance sheets for most 
countries refer to a year between 2013 and 2017. 
To estimate a value of DEC for up to 2018, data 
on the per capita availability of cereals and 
meats, available from FAO's Trade and Markets 
Division,
5 are used to estimate the likely rates of 
change in per capita dietary energy availability 
from 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 or 2017 (depending 
on the country) to 2018. Such rates of change are 
then applied to the latest available DEC values to 
project them up to 2018.
| 149 |ANNEX 1
Projection of the CV.
 Until recently, the CV 
estimated for a country from last available food 
consumption survey data was always projected 
ahead with no change. Since 2014, however, 
FIES data provide evidence on recent changes in 
the extent of severe food insecurity that might 
closely reflect changes in the PoU. To the extent 
that such changes in PoU are not explained by 
changes in average food supplies, they can thus 
be used to infer the likely changes in the CV 
that might have occurred in the most recent 
year. Analysis of the combined set of historic 
PoU estimates reveals that, on average, and 
once differences in DEC and MDER have been 
controlled for, CVs explain about one-third of 
the differences in PoU across time and space. 
Possible changes in the CV from 2017 to 2018, to 
be considered in addition to projected changes in 
DEC described above, are thus imputed based on 
the results of an analysis of FIES data. For each 
country for which FIES data are available, the 
CV is revised by the amount that would generate 
one-third of a percentage point change in the 
PoU for each observed percentage point change 
in FI
sev
. For all other countries, the CV is kept 
constant to the estimated 2017 value.
Projection of the MDER.
 The MDER in 2018 is based 
on the projected population structure from the 
World Population Prospects (2017 revision, 
medium variant).
Challenges and limitations: 
While formally the state of 
being undernourished or not is a condition that 
applies to individuals, given the data usually 
available on a large scale it is impossible to 
reliably identify which individuals, in a certain 
group are actually undernourished. Through the 
statistical model described above, the indicator 
can only be computed with reference to a 
population or a group of individuals for 
which a representative sample is available. 
The prevalence of undernourishment is thus an 
estimate of the percentage of individuals in that 
group that are in such condition and cannot be 
further disaggregated.
Due to the probabilistic nature of the inference 
and the margins of uncertainty associated with 
estimates of each of the parameters in the model, 
the precision of the PoU estimates is generally 
low. While it is not possible to formally compute 
margins of error around PoU estimates, these are 
expected to likely exceed 5˜percent in most cases. 
For this reason, FAO does not consider PoU 
estimates that result to be lower than 2.5˜percent 
as sufficiently reliable to be reported.

.FOOD INSECURITY AS MEASURED 
 BY THE FOOD INSECURITY EXPERIENCE 
SCALE (FIES)
Definition:
 Food insecurity as measured by this 
indicator refers to limited 
access to food, 
at the 
level of individuals or households, due to lack of 
money or other resources
. The 
severity of food 
insecurity is measured using data collected with 
the 
Food Insecurity Experience Scale survey 
module
 (FIES-SM), a set of eight questions 
asking individual or households to self-report 
conditions and experiences typically associated 
with limited access to food. 
Using sophisticated statistical techniques 
based on the Rasch measurement model, the 
information obtained in a survey is validated 
for internal consistency and converted into 
a quantitative measure along a scale of 
severity, ranging from low to high. Based on 
their responses to the FIES-SM items, the 
individuals or households interviewed in 
| 150 |a nationally representative survey of the 
population are assigned a probability to be 
in one of three classes: food secure or only 
marginally insecure; moderately food insecure; 
and severely food insecure as defined by 
two globally set thresholds. Based on FIES 
data collected over three years from 2014 to 
2016, FAO has established the FIES reference 
scale, which is used as the global standard for 
experience-based food-insecurity measures 
(Box 3
), and to set the two reference thresholds 
of severity.
SDG Indicator 2.1.2 is obtained as the cumulated 
probability to be in either one of the two 
classes of moderate and severe food insecurity. 
A separate indicator (FI
sev
) is computed by 
considering only the severe food-insecurity class.
How it is reported:
 In this report,
 FAO provides 
estimates of food insecurity at two different 
levels of severity: moderate or severe food 
insecurity (FI
mod+sev
) and severe food insecurity 
(FI
sev
). For each of these two levels, two 
estimates are reported:
 the 
prevalence (%) of individuals
 in the 
population living in households where at least 
one adult was found to be food insecure;
 the estimated 
number of individuals
 in the 
population living in households where at least 
one adult was found to be food insecure.
Data source:
 Since 2014, the eight-question FIES 
survey module has been applied in nationally 
representative samples of the adult population 
(defined as aged 15˜or older) in more than 
140˜countries included in the Gallup
® World 
Poll (GWP), covering 90˜percent of the world 
population. In most countries, samples include 
about 1˜000˜individuals, with larger samples 
of 3˜000˜individuals in India and 5˜000˜in 
mainland China. 
For Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Canada, Chile, 
Ecuador, Ghana, Indonesia, Israel, Kenya, 
Malawi, Nigeria, Palestine, Republic of Korea 
(2014 and 2015), Russian Federation (2016, 2017 
and 2018), Saint Lucia, Seychelles, and United 
States of America, national government survey 
data were used to calculate the prevalence 
estimates of food insecurity by applying FAO™s 
statistical methods to adjust national results to 
the same global reference standard.
Methodology:
 The data were validated and used 
to construct a scale of food-insecurity severity 
using the Rasch model, which postulates that the 
probability of observing an affirmative answer by 
respondent 
i to question 
j is a logistic function of 
the distance, on an underlying scale of severity, 
between the position of the respondent, 
ai, and 
that of the item, 
bj. By applying the Rasch model to the FIES data, it 
is possible to estimate the probability of being 
food insecure 
(pi,L
) at each level of severity of 
food insecurity 
L (moderate or severe, or severe), 
for each respondent 
i, with 
0 < p i,L
 < 1. The prevalence of food insecurity
 at each level 
of severity (
FIL) in the population is computed 
as the weighted sum of the probability of being 
severely food insecure for all respondents (
i) in 
a sample: 
FIL = ˜p
i,L
wiwhere 
wi are post-stratification weights 
that indicate the proportion of individuals 
or households in the national population 
represented by each record in the sample.
As only individuals aged 15 or more are 
sampled in the GWP, the prevalence 
estimates directly produced from these data 
refer to the population 15˜years and older. 
To arrive at the 
prevalence and number of 
individuals (of all ages) in the population
, an 
estimate is required of the number of people 
living in the households where at least 
one adult is estimated to be food insecure. 
This involves a multistep procedure detailed 
in Annex˜II of the 
Voices of the hungry 
technical report
 (see link in the ﬁReferencesﬂ 
section, below). 
Prob
(Xi,j
 = Yes)
 =   exp(
ai Œ bj)1 + exp(
ai Œ bj)| 151 |ANNEX 1
Regional and global aggregates
 of food insecurity 
at moderate or severe, and severe levels, 
FIL, are 
computed as: 
where 
r indicates the region
, FI
L,c is the value 
of FI at level 
L estimated for country 
c in the 
region and 
Nc is the corresponding population 
size. When no estimate of 
FIL is available for 
a country, it is assumed to be equal to the 
population-weighted average of the estimated 
values of the remaining countries in the same 
region. A regional aggregate is produced 
only if the countries for which an estimate 
is available cover at least 50˜percent of the 
region™s population.
Universal thresholds are defined on the FIES 
global standard scale (a set of item parameter 
values based on results from all countries 
covered by the GWP in 2014Œ16) and converted 
into corresponding values on local scales. 
The process of calibrating each country™s scale 
against the FIES global standard can be referred 
to as 
equating
, and permits the production 
of internationally comparable
 measures 
of food-insecurity severity for individual 
respondents, as well as comparable national 
prevalence rates.
The problem stems from the fact that, when 
defined as a 
latent 
trait, the severity of food 
insecurity has no absolute reference against 
which it could be evaluated. The Rasch model 
allows to identify the relative position that 
the various items occupy on a scale that is 
denominated in logit units, but whose ﬁzeroﬂ 
is arbitrarily set, usually to correspond to 
the mean estimated severity. This implies 
that the zero of the scale changes in each 
application. To produce comparable measures 
over time and across different populations 
requires establishing a common scale to use 
as a reference, and finding the formula needed 
to convert measures across different scales. 
As it is the case for converting measures of 
temperature across difference measuring scales 
(such as Celsius and Fahrenheit) this requires 
FIL,r 
= ˜c FIL,c
 × Nc˜c Ncthe identification of a number of ﬁanchoringﬂ 
points. In the FIES methodology, these anchoring 
points are the severity levels associated with 
the items whose 
relative 
position on the scale 
of severity can be considered equal to that of 
the corresponding items on the global reference 
scale. The ﬁmappingﬂ of the measures from one 
scale to the other is then obtained by finding the 
formula that equates the mean and the standard 
deviations of the common items™ severity levels.
Challenges and limitations:
 When food-insecurity 
prevalence estimates are based on FIES data 
collected in the GWP, with national sample sizes 
of about 1˜000˜in most countries, confidence 
intervals rarely exceed 20˜percent of the 
measured prevalence (that is, prevalence rates of 
50˜percent would have margins of error of up to 
plus or minus 5˜percent). Confidence intervals 
are likely to be much smaller, however, when 
national prevalence rates are estimated using 
larger samples and for estimates referring to 
aggregates of several countries.
 To reduce the 
impact of year-to-year sampling variability, 
country-level estimates are presented as 
three-year averages, computed as averages of all 
available years in the considered triennia.
Research by a joint team from FAO, IFAD, WFP 
and UNICEF is ongoing to further refine the 
current methodology. The team is exploring 
possible issues related to the reference period 
when questionnaires with different reference 
periods are used to collect data, and studying 
robust ways to limit the potential risk of inducing 
a bias, when adjusting country results to the 
global reference scale, by further accommodating 
possible differences in interpretation of the FIES 
items in different languages or cultural contexts.

IN CHILDREN UNDER FIVE YEARS OF AGE
Definition of stunting
: Height/length (cm) for age 
(months) < -2 SD of the 2006 WHO Child Growth 
Standards median. Low height-for-age is an 
indicator that reflects the cumulative effects of 
undernutrition and infections since and even 
before birth. It may be the result of long-term 
nutritional deprivation, recurrent infections and 
lack of water and sanitation infrastructures. 
How is stunting reported: 
The percentage of children 
aged 0
Œ59 months who are below -2 standard 
deviation (SD) from the median height-for-age of 
the 2006 WHO Child Growth Standards. 
Definition of wasting: 
Weight (kg) for height/length 
(cm) < 
-2 SD of the 2006 WHO Child Growth 
Standards median.
 Low weight-for-height is an 
indicator of acute weight loss or a failure to gain 
weight and can be consequence of insufficient 
food intake and/or an incidence of infectious 
diseases, especially diarrhoea.
How is wasting reported: 
The percentage of children 
aged 0Œ59 months who are below -2 SD from 
the median weight-for-height of the 2006 WHO 
Child Growth Standards. 
Definition of childhood overweight: 
Weight (kg) for 
height/length (cm) > +2 SD of the 2006 WHO 
Child Growth Standards median.
 This indicator 
reflects excessive weight gain for height generally 
due to energy intakes exceeding children™s 
energy requirements. 
How is the childhood overweight reported: 
The percentage of 
children aged 0Œ59 months who are over +2 SD 
from the median weight-for-height of the WHO 
Child Growth Standards.

estimates
; https://data.worldbank.org
Methodology: 
National household surveys (MICS, 
DHS, national nutrition surveys, etc.) and 
national nutrition surveillance systems are the 
preferred primary data sources for child nutrition 
indicators. For entry in the database, they must 
be nationally representative, population-based 
surveys which present results based on the WHO 
Child Growth standards or provide access to the 
raw data enabling reanalysis. 
A weighted analysis was carried out to account 
for the different country populations and ensure 
that the influence in the regional trend analysis 
of a country™s survey estimate was proportional 
to the country™s population. The population 
weights were derived from the UN Population 
Prospects, revision 2017. For each data point, the 
respective under-five population estimate for the 
specific survey year was obtained. If a survey was 
performed over an extended period, for example 
November 2013 to April 2014, the mean year 
in which most of the fieldwork was completed 
(in this case 2014) was used as the year from 
which to choose the respective population 
estimate. Weights of countries with single data 
points were derived by dividing the under-five 
population at the time of the survey by the sum 
of the countries™ mean population in the whole 
region. For countries with multiple data points 
the weights were calculated by dividing the mean 
of the country™s under-five population (over 
the observed years) by the sum of those mean 
populations of countries within the whole region. 
A linear mixed-effect model was applied for each 
region or income group, using logistic transform 
of prevalence and results back-transformed 
to original scale. The final models were then 
used to project the trend of malnutrition in 
children from 1990 to 2018. Using the resulting 
prevalence estimates (after back-transformation), 
the total numbers affected were calculated 
by multiplying the prevalence and lower and 
upper limits of the confidence intervals by the 
subregional population derived from the UN 
population estimates. 
Variables:
 region, subregion, country, survey 
year, sample size, minimum and maximum age 
surveyed, prevalence of stunting, prevalence of 
| 153 |ANNEX 1
wasting, prevalence of severe wasting, prevalence 
of overweight, country population of under five 
years of age. 
Challenges and limitations: 
The recommended 
periodicity for countries to report on stunting, 
overweight and wasting is every three to five 
years; however, for some countries data are 
available less frequently. While every effort has 
been made to maximize the comparability of 
statistics across countries and over time, country 
data may differ in terms of data collection 
methods, population coverage and estimation 
methods used. Survey estimates come with levels 
of uncertainty due to both sampling errors and 
non-sampling errors (technical measurement 
errors, recording errors, etc.). Neither of the two 
sources of error has been fully taken into account 
for deriving estimates at country or regional and 
global levels. 
For the prevalence of wasting, as surveys are 
generally carried out during a specific period 
of the year, the estimates can be affected by 
seasonality. Seasonal factors related to wasting 
include food availability (e.g. preharvest periods) 
and disease (rainy season and diarrhoea, malaria, 
etc.), while natural disasters and conflicts 
can also show real shifts in trends that would 
need to be treated differently than a seasonal 
variation. Hence, country years estimates for 
wasting may not necessarily be comparable over 
time. Consequently, only the most recent (2018) 
estimates are provided.

EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING
Definition: 
Exclusive breastfeeding for infants < six 
months of age is defined as receiving only breast 
milk and no additional food or drink, not even 
water.
 Exclusive breastfeeding is a cornerstone of 
child survival and is the best food for newborns, 
as breast milk shapes the baby™s microbiome, 
strengthens the immune system, and reduces the 
risk of developing chronic diseases. 
Breastfeeding also benefits mothers by 
preventing postpartum haemorrhage and 
promoting uterine involution, decreasing 
risk of iron-deficiency anaemia, reducing the 
risk of various types of cancer and providing 
psychological benefits. 
How exclusive breastfeeding is reported: 
Percentage of 
infants aged 0Œ5 months who are fed exclusively 
on breast milk with no additional food or drink, 
not even water, in the 24˜hours preceding 
the survey.

Child Feeding. In:

https://data.unicef.org/topic/
nutrition/infant-and-young-child-feeding
Methodology: 
Infants 0Œ5 months of age who received only 
breastmilk during the previous day
Infants 0Œ5 months of age
This indicator includes breastfeeding by a wet 
nurse and feeding expressed breast milk. 
The indicator is based on a recall of the previous 
day™s feeding to a cross-section of infants 0Œ5 
months of age.
In 2012, the regional and global exclusive 
breastfeeding estimates were generated using 
the most recent estimate available for each 
country between 2005 and 2012. Similarly, 2018 
estimates were developed using the most recent 
estimate available for each country between 2013 
| 154 |and 2018. Global and regional estimates were 
calculated as weighted averages of the prevalence 
of exclusive breastfeeding in each country, 
using the total number of births from the World 
Population Prospects, 2017 revision (2012 for the 
baseline and 2018 for the current) as weights. 
Estimates are presented only where the available 
data are representative of at least 50˜percent of 
corresponding regions™ total number of births, 
unless otherwise noted. 
Challenges and limitations: 
While a high proportion 
of countries collect data for exclusive 
breastfeeding, data are lacking in high-income 
countries in particular. The recommended 
periodicity of reporting on exclusive 
breastfeeding is every three to five years. 
However, for some countries, data are reported 
less frequently, meaning changes in feeding 
patterns are often not detected for several years 
after the change occurs.
Regional and global averages may be affected 
depending on which countries had data available 
for the periods considered in this report. 
Using the previous day™s feeding as a basis may 
cause the proportion of exclusively breastfed 
infants to be overestimated as some infants 
who may have been given other liquids or foods 
irregularly may not have received these in the 
day before the survey.

LOW BIRTHWEIGHT 
Definition:
 Low birthweight is defined as a weight at 
birth of less than 2˜500˜grams (less than 5.51˜lbs), 
regardless of gestational age. A newborn™s weight 
at birth is an important marker of maternal and 
foetal health and nutrition.

low-birthweight
; https://www.who.int/
nutgrowthdb
Methodology:
 Nationally representative estimates 
of low birthweight prevalence can be derived 
from a range of sources, broadly defined as 
national administrative data or representative 
household surveys. National administrative 
data are those coming from national systems 
including Civil Registration and Vital Statistics 
(CRVS) systems, national Health Management 
Information Systems (HMIS) and birth 
registries.
 National household surveys which 
contain information about birthweight as well 
as key related indicators including maternal 
perception of size at birth (MICS, DHS) are also 
an important source of low birthweight data 
especially in 
contexts where many births are 
unweighed and/or data heaping is a problem. 
Prior to entry into the country data set, country 
data are reviewed for coverage and quality and 
adjusted where the source is a household survey. 
Administrative data are categorized as (i) high 
coverage, if representing ˚˜90˜percent of live 
births; (ii) medium coverage, if representing 
80Œ90˜percent of live births; or (iii) not included, 
if covering <˜80
˜percent of live births. To be 
included in the data set, survey data need to have:
i.
 a birthweight in the data set for at minimum 
30˜percent of the sample; 
ii.
 a minimum of 200˜birthweights in the 
data set; 
iii.
 no indication of severe data heaping Œ 
this 
means that: a) ˜˚55˚percent of all birthweights 
| 155 |can fall on the three most frequent birthweights 
(i.e. if 3˚000˚g, 3˚500˚g and 2˚500˚g were the 
three most frequent birthweights, when added 
together, they have to make up ˜˚55˚percent of 
all birthweights in the data set); b) ˜˚10˚percent 
of all birthweights ˛ 4˚500 g; c) ˜˚5˚percent of 
birthweights on tail ends of 500g and 5˚000˚g
; and 
iv.
 undergo an adjustment for missing 
birthweights and heaping.
6 Modelling methods were applied to the accepted 
(and for household survey data, accepted and 
adjusted) country data to generate annual 
country estimates from 2000 to 2015, with 
methods varying by availability and type of input 
data as follows: 
 b-s
pline:
 data for countries with ˚˜8 data points 
from higher coverage administrative sources 
with ˚˜1 prior to 2005 and ˚˜1 more point more 
recent than 2010 are smoothed with b-spline 
regression to generate annual low birthweight 
estimates. A b-spline regression model 
was used to predict the standard error and 
calculate 95˜percent confidence intervals for 
the country-level low birthweight estimates. 
These low birthweight estimates follow very 
closely those included in the countries™ own 
administrative reports.
 Hierarchical regression:
 data for countries not 
meeting requirements for b-spline but with 
˚˜1 low birthweight data point from any source 
meeting inclusion criteria are fitted into a 
model using covariates to generate annual low 
birthweight estimates, as well as uncertainty 
ranges, using a bootstrap approach. The model 
includes natural log of neonatal mortality 
rate; the proportion of children underweight 
(weight-for-age z-score below minus two 
standard deviations from median weight 
for age of reference population); data type 
(higher quality administrative, lower quality 
administrative, household survey); UN region 
(e.g. Southern Asia, Caribbean); and a 
country-specific random effect. These low 
birthweight estimates may vary substantially 
from estimates reported by countries in 
administrative and survey reports, especially 
given that the household survey estimates 
are adjusted for missing birthweights and 
heaping, while survey reports often present a 
low birthweight estimate just for the children 
with a birthweight and with no adjustment for 
data heaping.
 No estimate:
 countries for which low birthweight 
input data were not available and/or did 
not meet inclusion criteria are indicated in 
the database as ﬁno estimateﬂ. A total of 54 
countries in the current country database were 
reported as having ﬁno estimateﬂ. Despite not 
presenting an estimate for these individual 
54 countries, annual low birthweight 
estimates were derived for them using the 
hierarchical regression methods detailed 
above but used only to input into regional and 
global estimates.
Modelled annual country estimates are used 
to generate regional and global estimates in 
2000Œ2015. Global estimates are derived by 
summing the estimated number of live births 
weighing less than 2˜500˜g for 195
7 countries 
with an estimate in the United Nations regional 
grouping for each year and dividing by all 
live births in each year in those 195 countries. 
Regional estimates are similarly derived, 
based on countries in each regional grouping. 
To obtain the global and regional level estimates 
of uncertainty, 1˜000 low birthweight point 
estimates were made for each country for each 
year using either b-spline (by randomly sampling 
from a normal distribution plotted using the 
calculated standard error) or hierarchical 
regression approach (using a bootstrap approach). 
The country low birthweight estimates for each 
of the 1˜000 samples were summed at worldwide 
or regional level and the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles 
of the resulting distributions were used as the 
confidence intervals. 
Challenges and limitations:
 A major limitation of 
monitoring low birthweight globally is the lack of 
birthweight data for many of the world™s children. 
There is a notable bias among the unweighed, with 
those born to poorer, less educated, rural mothers 
being less likely to have a birthweight when 
compared with their richer, urban counterparts 
with more highly educated mothers.
8 As the 
characteristics of the unweighed are risk factors 
| 156 |for having a low birthweight, estimates that do 
not well represent these children may be lower 
than the true value. Furthermore, poor quality of 
available data with regard to excessive heaping on 
multiples of 500˜g or 100˜g exists in the majority 
of available data from LMIC
9 and can further bias 
low birthweight estimates. The methods applied 
to adjust for missing birthweights and heaping 
for survey estimates in the current database
10 are 
meant to address the problem, however there were 
a total of 54 countries for which it was not possible 
to generate a reliable birthweight estimate. 
In addition, the confidence limits of the regional 
and global estimates may be artificially small 
given that about half of the modelled countries 
had a country-specific effect generated at random 
for each bootstrap prediction, some of which were 
positive and others negative, making the relative 
uncertainty at the regional and global level tend to 
be less than that at the individual country level.

ADULT OBESITY
Definition: 
BMI ˚ 30.0˜kg/m
2. The body mass index 
(BMI) is the ratio of weight-to-height commonly 
used to classify the nutritional status of adults. 
It is calculated as the body weight in kilograms 
divided by the square of the body height in 
meters (kg/m
2). Obesity includes individuals with 
BMI equal or higher than 30 kg/m

Methodology:
 A Bayesian hierarchical model was 
applied to selected population-based studies that 
had measured height and weight in adults aged 
18 years and older to estimate trends from 1975 to 
2014 in mean BMI and in the prevalence of BMI 
categories (underweight, overweight and obesity). 
The sample included 1˜698 population-based 
studies with more than 19.2 million participants 
aged 18 years or older, measured in 186 countries. 
The model incorporated nonlinear time trends 
and age patterns; national versus subnational and 
community representativeness; and whether data 
covered both rural and urban areas versus only 
one of them. The model also included covariates 
that help predict BMI, including national 
income, proportion of population living in urban 
areas, mean number of years of education, and 
summary measures of availability of different 
food types for human consumption.  
Challenges and limitations: 
Some countries had few data 
sources and only 42˜percent of included sources 
reported data for people older than 70˜years.

Methodology:
 National representative surveys, 
summary statistics from WHO™s Vitamin and 
Mineral Nutrition Information Systems and, 
summary statistics reported by other national 
and international agencies. 
Data for non-pregnant women and pregnant 
women were summed and weighted by the 
prevalence of pregnancy to generate one value 
for all women of reproductive age. Data were 
adjusted by altitude and, when available, 
smoking status. 
Trends were modelled over time as a linear 
trend plus a smooth nonlinear trend, at national, 
regional, and global levels. The model used a 
weighted average of various bell-shaped densities 
to estimate full haemoglobin distributions, which 
might themselves be skewed. 
The estimates are also informed by covariates 
that help predict haemoglobin concentrations, 
including maternal education, proportion of 
population in urban areas, mean latitude, 
prevalence of sickle cell disorders and 
thalassemia and mean BMI. All covariates were 
available for every country and year, except 
the prevalence of sickle cell disorders and 
thalassaemia, which was assumed as constant 
over time during the analysis period for 
each country. 
Challenges and limitations:
 Despite a high proportion 
of countries having nationally representative 
survey data available for anaemia, there is still a 
lack of reporting on this indicator, especially in 
high-income countries. As a result, the estimates 
may not capture the full variation across 
countries and regions, trending to ﬁshrinkﬂ 
towards global means when data are sparse.

METHODOLOGIES PART 1
A. Food insecurity compared with other important indicators of human development This section provides additional details 
about the analysis presented in 
Box 4
 ﬁHow do 
estimates of food insecurity compare with other 
important indicators of human development?ﬂ of 
Section 1.1. Spearman™s rank correlations were 
computed between the national prevalence of 
food insecurity at moderate or severe levels (as 
three-year average in the period 2016Œ2018) and 
the most recent value available for other selected 
development indicators. 
Table 
A2.1
 summarizes 
the source and description for each of these, in 
alphabetical order. 
B. Gender gap in accessing foodThis section provides additional details about 
the analysis performed in the section ﬁGender 
differences in food insecurityﬂ of Section 1.1.
B1. Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity among adults by genderFigure 14
 is derived using data collected by 
FAO. These data are collected at individual 
level. Each respondent (adult Œ 15 years or 
older) answers the FIES survey module by 
making reference to his/her own individual 
food-insecurity condition. For this reason, it 
is possible to disaggregate the results of food 
insecurity by male and female respondents. To do 
so, first, the possible presence of differential 
item functioning (DIF) between male and 
female respondents was checked, to make sure 
that differences between men and women in 
food-insecurity levels was not due to the fact 
that they may experience in a different way the 
same food-security conditions or that they may 
interpret the same question in a different way. 
Results (not shown) point to no significant DIF 
between men and women. Based on this result, 
prevalence rates of food insecurity among men 
and women are calculated by applying different 
weighted raw score distributions (one for men 
and one for women) to the same probabilities 
of food insecurity, calculated at country level 
based on raw score parameters and errors 
obtained by the application of the Rasch model. 
This computation was performed for each year 
of data for each country. The results shown in 
the graph are based on the three-year-averaged 
country results in the period 2016Œ2018.
B2. Regression analysisThe text following 
Figure 14
 in the report describes 
an analysis that aims at better understanding the 
determinants of gender gaps in accessing food, 
once controlling for other factors. The analysis is 
performed by pooling together individual-level 
FIES data collected by FAO in 145 countries, from 
2014 to 2017, with the purpose of assessing the 
extent of any differences in the food-insecurity 
status of men and women, after controlling for 
socio-economic factors. A logistic regression 
is applied using the food-insecurity status as a 
dependent variable, established by considering 
the cross-country comparable probability of 
being food insecure at moderate or severe level 
for each country. If the probability is larger than 
50˜percent, the individual is classified as ﬁfood 
insecureﬂ and the dependent variable takes the 
value of 1, otherwise it assumes a value of 0. 
Gender, area of residence (rural or small town 
versus large city or suburbs), poverty status, and 
education level of the respondents are included as 
independent variables. The year of data collection 
(between 2014 and 2017) is also included as a 
covariate. Results show that, after controlling for 
area of residence, poverty status and education 
level of the respondents, the odds of being food 
insecure are still approximately 10˜percent higher 
for women than for men.

D2. Definition of variablesFood insecurity was constructed as a 
dichotomous variable (FI
mod+sev
 or food secure/
mildly food insecure),  based on experience-based 
food-insecurity scales data from each data set. 
Each country™s food-insecurity scale was equated 
to the global reference scale following the FIES 
methodology (
Box 3
) to produce a cross-country 
comparable measure of food insecurity. 
All the dependent variables were dichotomous 
(presence/absence of specific form of 
malnutrition). WHO Child Growth Standards 
and official cut-points were used for constructing 
the child and school-age children and adolescent 
anthropometric indicators. BMI cut-offs from 
WHO were used for constructing overweight and 
obesity indicators for adults.
Tables A2.4
 and 
A2.5
 present a brief description 
of each of the malnutrition indicators and the 
dependent variables.
D3. Model specificationLogistic regression equations were used to 
estimate the likelihood of an individual being 
malnourished given the food-insecurity status 
of their household. Regressions were estimated 
for each malnutrition outcome considered, while 
controlling for cluster (household) effects and 
relevant covariates (described below). For each 
country and outcome variable, alternative model 
specifications with various combinations of 
covariates and interaction terms were tried.

PoU CHANGE POINT 
DEFINITIONS, 
METHODOLOGY AND 
COUNTRY LISTS
A. Definition of economic slowdown  and downturnEconomic slowdowns and downturns have been 
identified using the real annual rate of per capita 
GDP growth at constant 2010 prices, expressed 
in US dollars.
11 The change in country per capita 
growth across two successive years is computed 
to obtain a simple difference in growth. Thus, a 
slowdown is identified when per capita growth 
in the current year is positive but lower in 
magnitude compared with the previous year. 
Downturns are defined when the difference 
in per capita growth between two periods is 
negative. Furthermore, information on the 
frequency of economic slowdowns and downturns 
is provided by the number of consecutive years 
when a country experienced either of the two. 
B. PoU change point analysis  and methodologyA change point refers to the statistically 
significant change in the prevalence of 
undernourishment over time. In this report 
the focus is on increasing change points, i.e. 
a statistically significant and positive increase 
in the prevalence of undernourishment over 
two consecutive years. Change points in the 
PoU time series were identified by applying the 
multiple structural changes model proposed by 
Bai and Perron (1998).
12 This involves finding 
the ﬁbestﬂ combination of 
n possible breaks 
subject to the constraint that distance between 
break intervals should be above a minimum 
length. Here ﬁbestﬂ means minimum sum of 
squared residuals from an OLS regression of 
PoU on a set of dummies indicating the timing 
of the breaks. A minimum break interval of 
three years was imposed in the identification 
of the optimal segmentation. PoU in years 
2005Œ2018 was used to identify change points 
between years 2006Œ2017. An additional 
constraint has been used to identify the relevant 
change points, i.e. only those characterized by 
a subsequent increasing tendency (estimated 
by an ordinary least squares method) for two 
consecutive years.
The change point analysis consists in 
identifying increasing PoU change points 
that correspond to the occurrence of an 
economic slowdown or downturn in low- and 
middle-income countries. Economic slowdowns 
and downturns are identified when they occur 
in one of the two years before the PoU change 
point, for instance, between 2013Œ2014 or 
2014Œ2015 if the PoU change point occurs in 
2015. 
Figure 
24 shows the number of countries 
with PoU change points in correspondence 
with economic slowdowns or downturns by 
year (2006Œ2017). 
Table 
A3.1
 lists 96 increases in 
PoU change point occurred in 65 countries in 
correspondence with economic slowdowns and 
downturns between years 2011Œ2017.
In order to identify low- and middle-income 
countries, the 2017 World Bank classification 
is used. Although Argentina and Panama are 
classified as high income countries in 2017 
(Table˜A3.1
) they are included in the analysis since 
they have been classified as upper-middle- 
income countries for the majority of the time 
 (at least five out of seven years during the 
period 2011Œ2017).

the PoU to be included in the aggregates. When no
 
estimates of DEC or CV are available, the 
PoU is
 imputed to the population-weighted average of
 
the estimated values of the remaining countries

| 168 |ECONOMIC GROWTH 
AND CHANGE IN PoU BETWEEN 2011 AND 
2017A. Evidence of statistical correlation between economic downturns and PoU between the years 2011and 2017: model specification  and results To explore whether the recent 
observed increases in the prevalence of 
undernourishment (PoU) are statistically 
associated with economic slowdowns and 
downturns, an analysis was undertaken on 
the relationship between changes in PoU and 
economic growth between 2011 and 2017. 
No attempt was made to model the complex 
mechanism and the diverse pathways by 
which economic growth and hunger are 
linked. This would require modelling the 
complex relationships between economic, 
social, anthropometric and policy variables, 
and assessing the intricate feedback routes 
between them. Instead, the analysis focuses 
on a reduced form of this complex system 
and attempts to assess the correlation 
between hunger and economic performance 
Œ i.e. fast rates of growth, slowdowns and 
downturns. The results complement those of 
the PoU change point analysis (see 
Figure 24
 and Annex 3) and provide evidence that the 
relationship between economic downturns 
and PoU between the years of 2011 and 2017 
is more than one of simple corresponding 
occurrence. Only economic downturns are 
considered (not slowdowns) for the reasons 
explained below.
The relationship between changes in PoU and 
economic growth between 2011 and 2017 is 
analysed based on the approach of Headey 
(2013),
13 focusing on low- and middle-income 
countries. The approach involves a series of 
Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression 
analyses (
Table A4.2
) showing the correlation 
between the difference in the PoU and real per 
capita GDP growth between 2011 and 2017.
The years selected for this analysis (2011 and 
2017) correspond to the recent period in which 
there are notable observed increases in PoU. 
As highlighted in Part˜1 of this report and 
the two previous editions of the report, the 
prevalence of undernourishment and the number 
of undernourished people in the world began 
to increase at the aggregate world level in 2016. 
However, for many countries, especially low- 
and lower-middle-income countries, as well as 
countries affected by conflict and adverse climate 
events, undernourishment had already been on 
the rise as early as 2011. For this reason, the 
starting year of the analysis is the earliest year in 
which a notable number of countries first began 
to experience a rise in hunger, i.e. 2011, and the 
aim is to determine whether there is a statistical 
correlation between the rise in PoU and economic 
growth during this period (2011 and 2017).
14However, for comparability and to test the 
robustness of the results, the same analysis was 
also carried out using the period between 2000 
and 2006, as well as the longer period between 
2000 and 2017. The results show consistency in 
that the estimated coefficient of economic growth 
is negative and statistically significant across 
all three periods and specifications, although 
the coefficient is higher in magnitude between 
years 2011 and 2017, as expected. As suggested 
by Hendry (1995),
15 when analysing long time 
periods it is necessary to exclude years of 
| 169 |ANNEX 4
ANNEX 4
structural breaks in the economy in order not 
to affect the average results. For this reason, 
when doing the additional robustness checks 
in analysing the two seven-year periods of 
2000Œ2006 and 2011Œ2017, the years marked by 
high volatility related to the global food price 
crisis and global financial crisis are omitted, 
 i.e. 2007Œ2010 (see 
Figure 22
 and 
Box 10
 on the global 
food crisis and the global financial crisis of 
 this period).
The dependent variable of the analysis is 
specified as the change in PoU between the 
years 2011 and 2017. It is a continuous variable 
having negative and positive values.
16 The PoU is 
a measure of chronic undernourishment, 
 so by definition changes in PoU occur slowly 
over time. For this reason, rather than focusing 
on a year-on-year setting, this analysis measures 
difference in PoU at two points that are far 
enough apart to allow for a sufficient change 
over time.
By definition the PoU is computed and 
smoothed over time and there is limited 
year-on-year variation in estimated values. 
In fact, PoU annual point estimates are 
calculated as a three-year moving average 
 (for instance, PoU in 2015 refers to the average 
PoU for 2014Œ2016, PoU in 2016 refers to the 
average for 2015Œ2017).
17 Thus, there is a 
two-year overlap in the PoU yearŒon-year time 
series, if all years are considered. Instead, by 
comparing the change in PoU between 2011 and 
2017, there is a sufficient time lapse to identify 
variations. Given this choice, the analysis 
is focused on economic downturns only, 
since three points in time are needed to also 
capture economic slowdowns. An alternative 
specification for sensitivity analysis was also 
tested in which only years 2011, 2013, 2015 
and 2017 are included, so that there is only a 
one-year overlap in the time series. This yielded 
similar results to those reported below.
18The independent variable Œ economic growth Œ 
is the percentage change in real GDP per capita 
(constant 2010 USD prices) between 2011 and 
2017, with the GDP deflator used to deflate 
growth in per capita GDP. Economic growth is 
computed using real per capita GDP comparing 
two points in time, 2011 and 2017, as: 
per capita GDP
2011
per capita GDP
2017
 Œ per capita GDP
2011   
*100
Real per capita GDP are from the UNSTAT 
website. An indicator of influence of outliers 
(dfbetas
) was computed to identify outlier 
countries. The following countries with 
dfbetas
 greater than 0.17 were excluded from the 
analysis: Angola, Libya, Nauru, Somalia and 
Timor-Leste.
19An additional sensitivity analysis was carried 
out using a logistic model with a dependent 
dummy variable equal to 1 for PoU increases 
between 2011 and 2017 and equal to zero 
otherwise. The results confirm the statistical 
significance of the relationship between 
increases in PoU and changes in real per capita 
GDP during the period analysed.
Tables A4.1
 and 
A4.2
 provide the descriptive statistics 
and econometric results, respectively.
Considering the changes in PoU between 
2011 and 2017, there are number of countries 
that do not show an increase in PoU between 
the two periods. As shown by the descriptive 
statistics (
Table A4.1
), 38 percent of the low- and 
middle-income countries (49 out of 130 countries) 
show an increase in PoU between 2011 and 2017, 
whereas 63 percent of the countries (81 out of 
130) do not show an increase in PoU between 
these two years.
B. Evidence of statistical association between changes in PoU between 2011 and 2017 and other drivers behind recent rise in prevalence of undernutrition: model specification  and results Additional regression analyses were run to 
explore the statistical association between 
changes in PoU between the years 2011 and 2017 
(dependent variable) and the three main drivers 
| 170 |of PoU: economic downturns (analysed in this 
report), as well as conflict and climate extremes 
(analysed in previous report editions, 2017 and 
2018, respectively). 
The specification of the dependent variable is the 
same as explained above. Three dummy variables 
are used as regressors to capture the effects of 
these three drivers: 
 Economic downturns
: a dummy variable 
equal to one if a country experiences negative 
economic growth between the years 2011 and 
2017. Economic growth is computed in the 
same way as explained above.
 Climate variability and extremes
: a dummy 
variable equal to one for countries with part 
of national cereal production or yield variance 
explained by climate factors for the period 
2011Œ2016, as analysed and defined in the 2018 
edition of this report.
20 Climate vulnerability 
is identified for countries whose national 
cereal production and yield variance are highly 
and statistically significantly associated with 
temperature, rainfall and vegetation growth. 
A country's climate vulnerability is defined 
over the period 2011Œ2016 and does not change 
over this time.
 Conflict
: a dummy variable equal to one 
if a country is affected by conflict during 
2011Œ2017, as analysed and defined in the 2017 
edition of this report.
21 In addition to this, as 
SOFI 2017 analysed conflict only up until 2015 
and more recent data are now available, this 
information is updated for the years 2016 and 
2017 using the Uppsala Conflict Data Program 
(UCDP). In this analysis, countries affected by 
conflict are defined as low- and middle-income 
countries and territories that have experienced 
conflict for at least five consecutive years 
between 2011Œ2017, and that have suffered 500 
or more battle deaths during this period.
22Table A4.3
 below reports the econometric results. 
Furthermore, in order to see how changes in 
PoU during 2011 and 2017 vary by the level of a 
country™s income, 
Tables A4.4a
 and 
A4.4b
 present the 
interaction between the three drivers and the 
three dummies denoting the level of a country™s 
income (low; lower-middle; upper-middle).

coefficients that are included but not reported in each model specification include: two dummies for the level of country income, a dummy for each driver of PoU change (either 
economic downturns, climate vulnerability or conflict), and two interaction terms between the driver of interest and each of the two dummies denoting the level of country 
income. Estimated coefficients in Table A4.4b derive from three model specifications that show the association between the PoU change and the three drivers regressed together

Countries affected by food crises in 2018 where economic shocks are a driver of acute food insecurity as identified by the 
Global Report on Food Crises 2019
 (GRFC). 
Information on economic shocks as drivers of food crises was not available in the GRFC 2019 for Jordan, Lebanon, Myanmar and Turkey. For these countries the information is 
obtained from the FAO Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) Country briefs referring to the year 2018. Economic slowdowns and downturns are identified when they 
either occur in years 2015Œ2016 or 2016Œ2017 and are computed using the annual rate of per capita growth at constant prices.

TABLE A5.1 
(CONTINUED)| 177 |COMMODITY 
DEPENDENCE 
DEFINITIONS AND 
COUNTRY LISTS 
A. Definition of commodity dependenceCommodity dependence is identified by 
applying the criterion proposed by UNCTAD 
and FAO (2017)
23 and Nkurunziza, Tsowou and 
Cazzaniga (2017).
24 A country is considered 
a commodity-dependent country when it 
experiences a dependence on primary commodity 
export revenues, a dependence on primary 
commodity imports, or both. In particular, 
commodity-export dependence is defined as 
the ratio of exports of primary commodities 
(agricultural products; minerals; ores and metals; 
and oil) to total merchandise exports in monetary 
terms. These export primary commodities are 
classified according to the Standard International 
Trade Classification (SITC), that is, i.e. SITC˜0 
+ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 68 + 667 + 971. When a 
country™s export-dependence ratio is higher 
than the average, which is 0.60 for the sample 
of low- and middle-income countries during 
years 1995Œ2017, a country is considered as high 
commodity-export dependent. 
Commodity-import dependence is defined as the 
ratio of imports of food (SITC 0 + 1 + 22 + 4) and 
fuels (SITC 3) to total merchandise imports in 
monetary terms. When a country has a share of 
imports higher than the average, which is 0.30 for 
low- and middle-income countries, it is defined 
as a high commodity-import dependent country. 
The data used to compute commodity dependence 
ratios are taken from UNCTADstat which 
provides yearly information on exports and 
imports by product in thousands of USD.
25 The 
analysis in Part 2 of the report is undertaken 
on low- and middle-income countries as overall 
they report higher levels of food insecurity and 
malnutrition. The analysis focuses on 129 low- 
and middle-income countries for which data on 
commodity dependence and PoU are available 
across the years of analysis. The period of 
commodity price booms reported in 
Table 9
 refers 
to years 2003Œ2011 (excluding years 2008Œ2009 of 
declining price trends).
A1. A typology of primary commodity dependence: 
definition and list of countriesFollowing the classification proposed by 
UNCTAD and FAO (2017),
26 Table A6.1
 classifies 
countries in four groups according to their 
commodity-export and commodity-import 
dependence ratios as measured during years 
1995Œ2017.
Table A6.2
 shows the list of countries in the four 
groups following the criteria reported in 
Table˜A6.1.
 In each of these groups countries are listed 
according to the level of country™s income, as 
established by the World Bank classification.
27A2. Net food importers
According to the UNCTAD definition, countries 
are defined as net food-importing when they 
have a negative average food trade balance in 
the years from 2013 to 2015. Food refers to the 
category ﬁfood, basic excluding tea, coffee, cocoa 
and spicesﬂ corresponding to SITC 0 + 22 + 4 
less 07.

B. Countries with vulnerability to hunger  and food crisesVulnerability refers to low- and middle-income 
countries that in recent years (2011Œ2017) reported 
a PoU change point increase, which denotes a 
significant increase in undernourishment, or 
experienced a food crisis in correspondence 
with economic shocks in 2018, as attested by 
the 
Global Report on Food Crises
 2019
. Out of the 
134 countries analysed in Part 2 of this report, 
86˜countries listed in 
Table A6.3
 experienced either a 
PoU change point increase between 2011 and 2017 
(column G) or a food crisis in 2018 (column˜H), 
or both. It is also indicated whether countries are 
commodity dependent (columns E and F), the 
number of economic slowdowns or downturns 
experienced during 2011Œ2017 (I and J), and the 
severity of the latter (column K) given by the 
number of consecutive years with downturns. 
Finally, combining information from the last two 
year editions of this report,
28 Table A6.3
 reports 
if countries have suffered from conflict and/or 
protracted crisis (columns L and M), and if they 
were vulnerable to climate in terms of production 
and yields (column N).

GLOSSARY
Acute food insecurity
Food insecurity found in a specified area at 
a specific point in time and of a severity that 
threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless 
of the causes, context or duration. Has relevance 
in providing strategic guidance to actions that 
focus on short-term objectives to prevent, 
mitigate or decrease severe food insecurity that 
threatens lives or livelihoods.
29Anthropometry
Use of human body measurements to obtain 
information about nutritional status.
Balance of payments
Refers to all economic transactions made by 
individuals, firms and government between the 
residents of a country and the rest of the world in 
a particular period of time. 
Chronic food insecurity 
Food insecurity that persists over time 
mainly due to structural causes. Can include 
seasonal food insecurity found in periods with 
non-exceptional conditions. Has relevance in 
providing strategic guidance to actions that focus 
on the medium- and long-term improvement of 
the quality and quantity of food consumption for 
an active and healthy life.
30Commodity dependence
In this report it refers to commodity-export and 
-import dependence experienced by low- and 
middle-income countries. Commodity-export 
dependence is defined as the ratio of exports 
of primary commodities (agricultural products, 
minerals, ores and metals, and oil) to total 
merchandise exports in monetary terms. 
Commodity-import dependence is defined as 
the ratio of imports of food to total merchandise 
imports in monetary terms. A country is 
considered as high commodity dependent when 
its export-dependence ratio is higher than 
60 percent and/or its import-dependence ratio is 
higher than 30˜percent. 
Commodity price boom
It refers to the rise in many primary commodity 
prices, for instance food, oil, metals and the like, 
during the early 2000s. In this report, the years 
of the commodity price boom include the period 
2003Œ2011, excluding years 2008 and 2009 where 
there was a sharp downturn in prices.
Countercyclical policy
In the context of an economic downturn or 
slowdown, countercyclical policies are all those 
policy measures aimed at counteracting the 
negative socio-economic effects of the economic 
downturn or slowdown.
Dietary energy intake
The energy content of food consumed.
Dietary energy supply (DES)
Food available for human consumption, 
expressed in kilocalories per person per day 
(kcal/person/day). At the country level, it is 
calculated as the food remaining for human use 
after deduction of all non-food utilizations (i.e. 
food = production + imports + stock withdrawals 
˛ exports ˛ industrial use ˛ animal feed Œ seed Œ 
wastage ˛ additions to stock). Wastage includes 
loss of usable products occurring along 
distribution chains from farm gate (or port of 
import) up to retail level.
Double-duty actions
Double-duty actions include interventions, 
programmes and policies that have the potential 
to simultaneously reduce the risk or burden of 
both undernutrition (including wasting, stunting 
| 185 |ANNEX 7
and micronutrient deficiency or insufficiency) 
and overweight, obesity or diet-related NCDs 
(including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease and some cancers). Double-duty actions 
leverage the coexistence of multiple forms of 
malnutrition and their shared drivers to offer 
integrated solutions.  
Economic downturn
Refers to a period of decline in economic activity 
or negative growth as measured by the growth 
rate in real GDP. It is a synonym for economic 
recession, a temporary or short-term downturn 
in economic growth, usually occurring over at 
least two consecutive quarters of decline. In the 
analyses and figures presented in this report, an 
economic downturn is identified using the year 
as a period of reference.
Economic shock
An unexpected or unpredictable event that is 
external to the specific economy and can either 
harm or boost it. A global financial crisis causing 
bank lending or credit to fall, or an economic 
downturn in a major trading partner of a country 
reflect demand-side shocks that can have 
multiple effects on spending and investment. 
A steep rise in oil and gas prices, natural 
disasters that result in sharp falls in production, 
or conflict that disrupts trade and production, are 
examples of supply-side shocks. 
Economic slowdown 
Refers to economic activity that is growing 
at a slower pace compared with the previous 
period. An economic slowdown occurs when 
real GDP growth declines from one period of 
time to another but it is still positive. In the 
analyses and figures presented in this report, an 
economic slowdown is identified using the year 
as the period of reference, although it is usually 
measured in quarters of a year.
Elasticity 
Refers to the extent to which a variable is 
responsive to a change in another variable (e.g. 
income elasticity of poverty). In the econometric 
analyses presented in this report it is calculated 
as the percent change in the dependent variable 
after a unit change in the independent variable(s). 
Extreme poverty
Refers to the percentage of people living on 
less than USD 1.90 a day (2011 PPP prices) in a 
country in a given year.
Fiscal space
The budgetary room that allows a government 
to provide resources for public purposes without 
undermining fiscal sustainability, i.e. the ability 
of a government to sustain its current spending, 
tax and other policies without threatening 
government solvency or defaulting on some of 
its liabilities. 
Food Insecurity Experience Scale
An experience-based food security scale used to 
produce a measure of access to food at different 
levels of severity that can be compared across 
contexts. It relies on data obtained by asking 
people, directly in surveys, about the occurrence 
of conditions and behaviours that are known to 
reflect constrained access to food. 
Food security 
A situation that exists when all people, at all 
times, have physical, social and economic access 
to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets 
their dietary needs and food preferences for an 
active and healthy life. Based on this definition, 
four food security dimensions can be identified: 
food availability, economic and physical access to 
food, food utilization, and stability over time.
Food security dimensions 
Refers to the four dimensions of food security:
a.
 Availability
 Œ This dimension addresses 
whether or not food is actually or potentially 
physically present, including aspects of 
production, food reserves, markets and 
transportation, and wild foods.
b. Access
 Œ If food is actually or potentially 
physically present, the next question is 
whether or not households and individuals 
have sufficient access to that food.
c.
 Utilization
 Œ If food is available and 
households have adequate access to it, the 
next question is whether or not households 
are maximizing the consumption of adequate 
nutrition and energy. Sufficient energy 
| 186 |and nutrient intake by individuals is the 
result of good care and feeding practices, 
food preparation, dietary diversity and 
intra-household distribution of food. 
Combined with good biological utilization of 
food consumed, this determines the nutritional 
status of individuals.
d.
 Stability
 Œ If the dimensions of availability, 
access and utilization are sufficiently met, 
stability is the condition in which the whole 
system is stable, thus ensuring that households 
are food secure at all times. Stability issues 
can refer to short-term instability (which can 
lead to acute food insecurity) or medium- 
to long-term instability (which can lead to 
chronic food insecurity). Climatic, economic, 
social and political factors can all be a source 
of instability.
Food systems
The entire range of actors and their interlinked 
value-adding activities involved in the 
production, aggregation, processing, distribution, 
consumption and disposal of food products. 
Food systems comprise all food products that 
originate from crop and livestock production, 
forestry, fisheries and aquaculture, as well as 
the broader economic, societal and natural 
environments in which these diverse production 
systems are embedded. 
Foreign direct investment
Refers to a category of investment where the 
objective is to establish a lasting interest by 
a resident enterprise in one economy (direct 
investor) in an enterprise (direct investment 
enterprise) that is resident in an economy 
different from the one of the direct investor. 
It implies the existence of a long-term 
relationship between the direct investor and the 
direct investment enterprise and a significant 
degree of influence on the management of 
the enterprise.
Gini index
Refers to the World Bank estimate and measures 
the extent to which the distribution of income 
 (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) 
among individuals or households within 
an economy deviates from a perfectly equal 
distribution. It is expressed as a percentage 
where 0 represents perfect equality and 100 
perfect inequality.
Global financial crisis
An economic shock occurred in 2009, the 
result of a financial meltdown that originated 
in developed countries. This had serious 
implications for the real economy and affected 
several parts of the world simultaneously, 
including developing countries.
Global food crisis
An episode of a sharp increase in international 
agricultural commodity prices between 2007 and 
early 2008  Œ in the summer of 2008, these prices 
reached their highest level in thirty years, before 
declining in the second half of 2008. 
Healthy diet
A balanced, diverse and appropriate selection 
of foods eaten over a period of time. A healthy 
diet ensures that the needs for macronutrients 
(proteins, fats and carbohydrates including 
dietary fibres) and essential micronutrients 
(vitamins, minerals and trace elements) are met 
specific to the person™s gender, age, physical 
activity level and physiological state. For diets 
to be healthy: 1) daily needs of energy, vitamins 
and minerals should be met, but energy intake 
should not exceed needs; 2) consumption of fruit 
and vegetables is over 400 g per day; 3) intake 
of saturated fats is less than 10 percent of total 
energy intake; 4) intake of trans-fats is less 
than 1 percent of total energy intake; 5) intake 
of free sugars is less than 10 percent of total 
energy intake or, preferably, less than 5 percent; 
6)˜intake of salt is less than 5 grams per day. 
A healthy diet 
for infants and young children
 is similar to that for adults, but the following 
elements are also important: 1) Infants should 
be breastfed exclusively during the first 
6˜months of life; 2)˜Infants should be breastfed 
continuously until 2˜years of age and beyond; 
3)˜From 6˜months of age, breast milk should be 
complemented with a variety of adequate, safe 
and nutrient-dense foods. Salt and sugars should 
not be added to complementary foods.
| 187 |Hunger
Hunger is an uncomfortable or painful physical 
sensation caused by insufficient consumption of 
dietary energy. In this report, the term hunger is 
synonymous with chronic undernourishment.
Macronutrients
These are the proteins, carbohydrates and 
fats available to be used for energy; measured 
in grams.
Malnutrition
An abnormal physiological condition caused by 
inadequate, unbalanced or excessive consumption 
of macronutrients and/or micronutrients. 
Malnutrition includes undernutrition (child 
stunting and wasting and vitamin and mineral 
deficiencies) as well as overweight and obesity.
Marginalization
It refers to the process of pushing particular 
groups of people Œ usually minorities such as 
indigenous people or rural women Œ to the edge 
of society by not allowing them to have an active 
participation, identity or place in society. 
Micronutrients
Vitamins, minerals and other substances that are 
required by the body in small amounts; measured 
in milligrams or micrograms.
Moderate food insecurity
The level of severity of food insecurity, based on 
the Food Insecurity Experience Scale, at which 
people face uncertainties about their ability to 
obtain food and have been forced to reduce, 
at times during the year, the quality and/or 
quantity of food they consume due to lack of 
money or other resources. It thus refers to a lack 
of consistent access to food, which diminishes 
dietary quality, disrupts normal eating patterns, 
and can have negative consequences for nutrition, 
health and well-being. 
Multiple burden of malnutrition
The coexistence of forms of undernutrition 
(child stunting and wasting and vitamin and 
mineral deficiencies) with overweight and obesity 
in the same country, community, household 
or individual.
Net food importers
Refers to countries or territories where the value 
of imports of basic foodstuffs outweighs the value 
of exports of basic foodstuffs. Net food importers 
experienced a negative average food trade 
balance from years 2013 to 2015 (for definition, 
see UNCTAD and FAO. 2017),
31 where food refers 
to the basic food category excluding tea, coffee, 
cocoa and spices.
Nutrition security
A situation that exists when secure access to 
an appropriately nutritious diet is coupled with 
a sanitary environment and adequate health 
services and care, in order to ensure a healthy 
and active life for all household members. 
Nutrition security differs from food security in 
that it also considers the aspects of adequate 
caregiving practices, health and hygiene, in 
addition to dietary adequacy.
Nutrition-sensitive intervention
An action designed to address the underlying 
determinants of nutrition (which include 
household food security, care for mothers and 
children, and primary healthcare and sanitation) 
but not necessarily having nutrition as the 
predominant goal.
Nutritional status
The physiological state of an individual that 
results from the relationship between nutrient 
intake and requirements and the body™s ability to 
digest, absorb and use these nutrients.
Overweight and obesity
Body weight that is above normal for height 
as a result of an excessive accumulation of 
fat. It is usually a manifestation of expending 
less energy than is consumed. In adults, 
overweight is defined as a BMI of 25˜kg/m
2 or 
more, and obesity as a BMI of 30˜kg/m
2 or more. 
In children under five years of age, overweight 
is defined as weight-for-height greater than 
2 standard deviations above the WHO Child 
Growth Standards median, and obesity as 
weight-for-height greater than 3˜standard 
deviations above the WHO Child Growth 
Standards median. 
ANNEX 7
| 188 |Prevalence of undernourishment
An estimate of the proportion of the population 
that lacks enough dietary energy for a healthy, 
active life. It is FAO™s traditional indicator used 
to monitor hunger at the global and regional 
level, as well as Sustainable Development Goal 
Indicator 2.1.1.
Resilience 
Resilience is the ability of individuals, 
households, communities, cities, institutions, 
systems and societies to prevent, resist, absorb, 
adapt, respond and recover positively, efficiently 
and effectively when faced with a wide range of 
risks, while maintaining an acceptable level of 
functioning and without compromising long-term 
prospects for sustainable development, peace and 
security, human rights and well-being for all.
32Risk
The probability or likelihood of occurrence 
of hazardous events or trends multiplied by 
the impacts if these events or trends occur. 
Risk to food insecurity is the probability of food 
insecurity resulting from interactions between a 
natural or human-induced hazard/shock/stress 
and vulnerable conditions.
Severe food insecurity
The level of severity of food insecurity at which 
people have likely run out of food, experienced 
hunger and, at the most extreme, gone for 
days without eating, putting their health and 
well-being at grave risk, based on the Food 
Insecurity Experience Scale. 
Shared prosperity
Refers to the average annual growth in income 
or consumption of the poorest 40 percent of the 
population (the bottom 40) within each country.
33 It implies that if shared prosperity in a country is 
positive, the poor are getting richer. This concept 
is summarized by the 
shared prosperity 
premium 
that is the difference between the 
annual income or consumption growth rate 
of the poorest (the bottom 40) and the annual 
growth rate of people at the mean of the income 
or consumption distribution. A positive premium 
indicates that the poorest 40 percent are getting a 
larger share of the overall income in the economy. 
Structural transformation
Structural transformation is both a cause and 
an effect of economic growth. It involves a 
change in the composition of the economy away 
from a reliance on agriculture and towards 
industry and services, rising involvement 
in international trade, growing ruralŒurban 
migration and urbanization. It leads to profound 
political, cultural, social and environmental 
stresses, which must be managed for 
long-term sustainability.
Stunting
Low height-for-age, reflecting a past episode 
or episodes of sustained undernutrition. 
In children under five years of age, stunting is 
defined height-for-age less than -2 standard 
deviations below the WHO Child Growth 
Standards median.
Terms of trade
Refers to the ratio between a country™s export 
prices over its import prices. It can be interpreted 
as the units of exports required to purchase a 
single unit of import.
Undernourishment
Undernourishment is defined as the condition 
in which an individual™s habitual food 
consumption is insufficient to provide the 
amount of dietary energy required to maintain 
a normal, active, healthy life. For the purposes 
of this report, hunger is defined as being 
synonymous with chronic undernourishment.
Undernutrition
The outcome of poor nutritional intake 
in terms of quantity and/or quality, and/
or poor absorption and/or poor biological 
use of nutrients consumed as a result of 
repeated instances of disease. It includes 
being underweight for one™s age, too short for 
one™s age (stunted), dangerously thin for one™s 
height (suffering from wasting) and deficient 
in vitamins and minerals (micronutrient 
deficiency).
Vulnerability
The conditions determined by physical, 
social, economic and environmental factors or 
| 189 |ANNEX 7
processes that increase the susceptibility of 
an individual, a community, assets or systems 
to the impacts of hazards.
34 Vulnerability to 
food insecurity is the range of conditions that 
increases the susceptibility of a household to 
the impact on food security in case of a shock 
or hazard. 
Wasting
Low weight-for-height, generally the result 
of weight loss associated with a recent period 
of inadequate dietary energy intake and/or 
disease. In children under five years of age, 
wasting is defined as weight-for-height less than 
-2 standard deviations below the WHO Child 
Growth Standards median.

8˜FIES or compatible data collected by national institutions 
are used in this report to inform the estimates of 
SDG Indicator 2.1.2 and of the prevalence of severe food 
insecurity for the following countries: Burkina Faso, Cabo 
Verde, Canada, Chile, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, 
Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Palestine, 
Republic of Korea, Saint Lucia, Seychelles and United 
States of America. FAO data collected through the Gallup 
World Poll are used to report on SDG 2.1.2 at national 
level for countries that have explicitly provided their 
authorization and to integrate official national data in 
producing regional and global estimates. Estimates for 
groups of countries are produced only when the 
population of the countries within the group for which data 
are available exceeds 50 percent of the total. For the 
specific methodology see Annex 1B; FIES measures the 
severity of food insecurity condition as experienced at any 
time during the reference period. For SDG monitoring 
purposes, the reference period is 12 months to ensure 
comparability of the estimates across countries. For other 
purposes (e.g. for short-term, continued monitoring of the 
situation in repeated surveys), the FIES survey module can 
be modified to use a one-month reference period.
9˜One notable difference between PoU and FI
sev
 exists for 
Eastern Asia, where the PoU is estimated to be 8.3 percent in 
2018 and 8.6 percent for the period 2016Œ18, driven by the 
value estimated for mainland China (see Annex 1A Table 
A1.1). FI
sev
 in this region is only 1.1 percent, and mainland 
China is aligned with other countries. Excluding Eastern Asia, 
there is a close correspondence between the overall number 
of undernourished and of severely food-insecure people 
measured with the FIES and their distribution across regions. 
It is also important to highlight that the worrisome global 
trend for the PoU, which is no longer declining in the most 
recent years, does not change even if excluding Eastern Asia.

53˜Food insecurity is the prevalence of moderate or severe 
food insecurity (FI
mod+sev
) in 2018, while nutritional outcomes 
are based on last available year. Correlations are computed 
using a different number of countries for each nutrition 
indicator, depending on data availability. For adult obesity 
and overweight in school-age children and adolescents, and 
for anaemia, the 86/87˜countries for which data are 
available cover all income levels (low-income: 11 countries; 
lower-middle-income: 27/28˜countries; upper-middle-income: 
24˜countries; and high-income: 24˜countries). For child 
stunting and wasting, high-income countries are not equally 
represented (low-income: 10˜countries; lower-middle-
income˜>˜20˜countries; upper-middle-income: 11˜countries; 
high-income: 2˜countries).
54˜Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity 
(2014Œ2016), PoU (2014Œ2016), and poverty headcount 
ratio at USD 1.90 a day (2013Œ2017) are used here as 
independent variables. Use of the prevalence of 
undernourishment is intended to control for the more severe 
forms of food insecurity. Multicollinearity prevents from 
including FI
sev
 directly as a control. As there are other 
structural indicators not controlled for, including those related 
to health and sanitation conditions or education levels, there 
may still be residual confounding. For details, see the 
technical note in Annex 2.

12˜The PoU estimates the proportion of the population 
habitually not meeting the (average) minimum daily 
dietary-intake requirements. It uses the dietary energy 
consumption (DEC), which is computed as a three-year 
average. This means that the PoU is a highly smoothed data 
time series, which can be expected to reflect to some extent 
major variations in production in cases where a country is not 
able to compensate large production drops with stocks and 
imports. This way of computing and smoothing the PoU data 
means there will be insufficient variability between years, 
which makes direct year-on-year regression on economic 
slowdowns and downturns problematic.
13
˜Economic slowdowns and downturns have been identified 
using the growth rate of GDP per capita at constant 2010 
prices, expressed in US dollars (USD). The change in the rate 
is computed for each country to obtain a simple difference in 
growth. See Annex 3 for full definitions. 
14˜See next section and Annex 6 for definition of commodity 
dependence. 
15˜The analysis is focused between 2011 and 2017 so that 
data points are sufficiently distant to detect changes and are 
not affected by sampling errors. On the other hand, it was 
not possible to undertake a statistical correlation analysis on 
year-on-year changes of PoU given the indicator is smoothed 
as noted.

27˜The diversification of their productive and export activities 
is a pending task for many transition and developing 
economies. The UNCTAD Merchandise Trade Specialization 
Index confirms that, despite the rapid rate of growth of trade 
in many developing economies over the period 1995˚2012, 
the degree of specialization in their export structures has not 
varied significantly. In a sample of relatively open developing 
economies, the index of export concentration has actually 
increased from the early 2000s (before the commodity 
| 196 |boom) to 2012. Dependence on a smaller set of export 
products has increased in commodity exporters, including 
Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela and the group of transition economies as a whole.

42˜Or, in other words, the purchasing power of primary 
commodity exports, expressed in terms of the value of 
imports, decreases over time (Prebisch-Singer hypothesis). This 
generally holds despite relatively short boom periods 
associated with primary commodity price booms. The main 
reason is that with rising incomes, smaller shares of income 
are spent on primary goods (due to the higher income 
elasticity of demand for manufactured goods compared with 
primary goods). Thus, the argument goes that the reliance of 
low-income countries on commodity exports is not such a 
viable long-term development strategy given the downward 
trajectory of the value of their exports. D. Hallam. 2018.

˜Poverty reduction can occur through higher average 
growth, a narrowing in income inequality, or a combination 
of the two.
150
˜The most widely referenced measure of inequality is the 
Gini coefficient, which varies between 0 (complete equality) 
and 1 (complete inequality). Since this coefficient tends to be 
skewed toward inequality at the top, it is usually 
complemented by other indicators, for example the ratio 
between the income share of the richest and the poorest 
20 percent of the population.

14˜The period 2006Œ2010 was not considered for the 
following reasons: 1) there are only a handful of countries 
that experience increases in PoU during this period (see 
Box˜10 and Figure˜24); 2) this period is marked by high 
volatility related to the global food price crisis and global 
financial crisis (see Box˜10), and there are no high frequency 
data of PoU during this high volatility, nor is PoU designed to 
capture such sharp and volatile swings in such a short period 
of time.
15˜D.F. Hendry. 1995. 
Dynamic econometrics Œ advanced 
texts in econometrics
. New York, USA, Oxford University Press.
16˜A sensitivity analysis using a logistic model was 
undertaken, with a dependent variable defined as a zero-one 
dummy variable denoting countries with an increase in PoU 
between years 2011 and 2017 vs. countries with no 
increase. The results were consistent with the Ordinary Least 
Squares (OLS) analysis.
17˜The PoU estimates the proportion of the population 
habitually meeting the (average) minimum daily dietary-intake 
requirements. It uses the DEC (dietary energy consumption), 
which is computed as a three-year average. This means that 
the PoU is a highly smoothed data time series, which can be 
expected to reflect to some extent major variations in 
production in cases where a country is not able to 
compensate for large production drops with stocks and 
imports. This way of computing and smoothing the PoU data 
means there will be insufficient variability between years, 
which makes direct year-on-year regression on economic 
slowdowns and downturns problematic.
18˜This alternative model specification involved the 
computation of change in PoU and in economic growth 
between years 2011Œ2013, 2013Œ2015 and 2015Œ2017. 
The results show that an average 10˜percent increase in 
economic growth is associated with a decrease in PoU of 
0.4˜percentage points occurring on average over a period 
of two years. Thus, if one considers the relevant seven-year 
period (2011Œ2017), a 10˜percent increase in economic 
growth is approximately associated with a 1.3˜percentage 
point decrease in PoU, where 1.3 is obtained multiplying 
the estimated coefficient of 0.4 by 3.5 (i.e. two-year 
average estimated coefficient, with 3.5 corresponding to a 
time span of seven years). Thus, this supports the robustness 
| 211 |of the estimated coefficient associated with economic 
growth shown in Table A4.2. Further analysis can be done 
using GMM-IV procedures (see M. Arellano and S. Bond. 
1991. Some tests of specification for panel data: Monte 
Carlo evidence and an application to employment 
equations. 
The Review of Economic Studies
, 58(2): 277, 
 but this is beyond the scope of the study, and in addition 
the PoU data available are not appropriate given the PoU is 
a three-year rolling average.
19˜By means of robustness, regressions were also run 
including the five outlier countries. The estimated coefficient 
of economic growth remained statistically significant and 
negative, although lower in magnitude (i.e. estimated 
coefficient is -0.9 with outliers, compared to -1.5 without). 
Standard errors of the models were clustered at the 
regional level.

2019
This year™s report presents evidence that the absolute number of people who suffer from 
hunger continues to slowly increase. The report also highlights that food insecurity is more than 
just hunger. For the first time, the report provides evidence that many people in the world, even 
if not hungry, experience moderate food insecurity as they face uncertainties about their ability 
to obtain food and are forced to compromise on the quality and/or quantity of the food they 
consume. This phenomenon is observed globally, not only in low- and middle-income countries 
but also in high-income countries.
The report also shows that the world is not on track to meet global nutrition targets, including 
those on low birthweight and on reducing stunting among children under five years. Moreover, 
overweight and obesity continue to increase in all regions, particularly among school-age 
children and adults. The report stresses that no region is exempt from the epidemic of 
overweight and obesity, underscoring the necessity of multifaceted, multisectoral approaches 
to halt and reverse these worrying trends. 
In light of the fragile state of the world economy, the report presents new evidence confirming 
that hunger has been on the rise for many countries where the economy has slowed down or 
contracted. Unpacking the links between economic slowdowns and downturns and food 
insecurity and malnutrition, the report contends that the effects of the former on the latter can 
only be offset by addressing the root causes of hunger and malnutrition: poverty, inequality 
and marginalization. The report concludes by recommending short- to long-term policies that 
address these underlying causes and safeguard food security and nutrition against economic 
slowdowns and downturns.

ANNEX III  52  Contents2Every day, WFP and its partners work to achieve the vision of a zero hunger world. In full alignment with 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), achieving 
this vision by 2030 will require not just WFP but the 
world to make nutritious food accessible and available all year round, to eliminate stunting; increase rural economic opportunity; prevent food waste; and 
promote sustainable agricultural development. As set out in Article II of WFP™s General Regulations the purposes of WFP are: (a) to use food aid to 
support economic and social development; (b) to meet 

refugee and other emergency and protracted relief 
food needs; and (c) to promote world food security in 
accordance with the recommendations of the United 
Nations and the Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO) of the United Nations. This Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) builds on the activities approved by the Executive Board in past strategic plans and policies and presents them in the context of the 2030 Agenda and the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The plan 
seeks to leverage WFP™s strengths to maximize the 
organization™s contribution to achievement of the 
SDGs, in the spirit of openness and collaboration 
called for by the Economic and Social Council 
(ECOSOC) of the United Nations, the General Assembly 
and the Secretary-General. The ultimate goal of this Strategic Plan is to support countries to end hunger.The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development conveys the global commitment to end poverty, 
hunger and inequality. The 2030 Agenda encompasses 
humanitarian and development activity situated within the broader context of human progress 
and sustainable development to achieve peace 
and prosperity for all. This Strategic Plan aligns WFP™s work with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and covers the period 2017Œ2021. WFP is the largest humanitarian organization addressing the challenges of global hunger and 
nutrition. While WFP™s mandate clearly articulates 
humanitarian and development responsibilities, 
the organization™s comparative advantage and long 
experience call for prioritization of emergency, life the poorest and most marginal people. The SDGs 
require moving beyond saving lives to changing

This Strategic Plan provides a new planning and operational framework to reinforce, through effective partnerships, WFP™s emergency, life-saving and logistics contributions as well as those it can make 
to ending hunger and chronic malnutrition. The plan 
does not expand WFP™s mandate.1 It leverages WFP™s primary strengths and capacities in humanitarian

from emergency relief to development to achieve the SDGs. WFP works to strengthen the resilience of affected people in protracted crises by applying a development lens in its humanitarian response. WFP supports a common, people centred, needs-driven approach that is guided by the humanitarian 
principles. WFP is committed to participating in 
humanitarian-development joint needs assessments, 
combined data analysis, and planning and 
programming processes to deliver better outcomes 
to people, moving beyond meeting needs to ending needs. In doing so, WFP will pay special attention to strengthening capacities of local crisis responders. and corporate results frameworks, guides the

growing inequality amplify these challenges, disrupting 

food systems, economies and societies as well as 
increasing people™s vulnerability. Current trends point 
to continued disruption over the medium term. The 2030 Agenda makes clear that sustainable development hinges on effective partnerships. WFP embraces this imperative, seeking to align 
and integrate its food assistance capacities and 
programmes with the interventions and investments 
of governments, other United Nations agencies, 
the private sector and civil society, which together 
can generate the systemic changes for sustainable 
development. WFP will work in synergy with partners to combine and leverage complementary strengths and resources. The objective will be transparent, with mechanisms for sharing risks, responsibilities and accountability. WFP will rely on partners with 1 The references to humanitarian and development work in the Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) will be implemented in accordance with the purpose and functions of

and collective action has long been central to WFP™s 
operations and is at the heart of the 2030 Agenda™s 
global call to action. The Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) Programme and operational innovation, effective communication, stakeholder advocacy, continuous 
staff skill development are critical requirements  for a successful delivery of the Plan. 
WFP is committed to the highest standards of integrity and its actions will at all times be guided by the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence.Given the ambitious timeframe of the 2030 Agenda, WFP is submitting this Strategic Plan one year early. 
The Plan can be extended or adjusted in 2021, with 
subsequent reviews every four years to harmonize with

Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review resolutions.
The Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) has been informed by agreements made at major international conferences and summits. It takes into consideration United Nations General Assembly resolutions and 
complementary global and regional frameworks 
aimed at ending hunger and malnutrition. The Plan 
draws on lessons from the mid-term review of 
the Strategic Plan (2014Œ2017), evaluations and 

consultations within WFP and with partners.The Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) allows WFP to evolve with other entities of the United Nations Development System (UNDS)2

UNDS to pursue integrated approaches and create cross-sectoral synergies to deliver interlinked results at all levels, supported by an enabling funding and 
governance architecture. The system has recognized 
this moment as a window of opportunity and is taking 
practical measures, both individually and collectively, 
to do business differently. The UNDS recognizes that 
its primary focus should be on achieving interlinked 
and transformative results at country level and promoting national ownership. The UNDS has renewed 
its commitment to deliver across mandates, sectors and institutional boundaries, working within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations, using more integrated and interconnected approaches. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals are interconnected. WFP will prioritize SDG 2, on 
achieving zero hunger; and SDG 17, on partnering to 
support implementation of the SDGs. Each Strategic 
WFP™s mandate and capacities, as demonstrated in its Programme of Work and the strong demand for 
its technical, operational, and common services, WFP 
anchors assessment of its performance towards these 
Strategic Objectives through Strategic Results that 
correspond to the targets of SDGs 2 and 17. Focusing 
on these Strategic Results ensures that WFP™s reporting 

is in line with countries™ measurement and reporting 
on progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda.THE STRATEGIC GOALS, STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIC RESULTS ARE:Strategic Goal 1: Support countries to achieve zero hunger (SDG 2)Strategic Objective 1End hunger by protecting access to food Strategic Result 1 Everyone has access to food (SDG Target 2.1)Strategic Objective 2

partnerships in each country in which WFP operates. 
Country Strategic Plans will determine the Strategic 
Results, presented as ﬁstrategic outcomesﬂ, to which 
WFP will contribute. These strategic outcomes will 

line with national priorities, goals and regulations and consistent with the core values of WFP and the United Nations. The strategic outcomes for each country link directly to the achievement of national SDG targets and hence to WFP Strategic Results. WFP™s primary 
focus on ending hunger may also contribute directly 
or indirectly to the outcomes related to SDGs other 
than 2 and 17 of countries and partners. Not all Strategic Objectives and Strategic Results will added value that WFP can bring at a particular time 
and place, and the presence and capabilities of other 
actors. For example, WFP will work with the African 
Union (AU) and its Regional Economic Communities 
realizing zero hunger. WFP will work in synergy with 
partners to implement programmes that strengthen
the capacities of people, communities and countries 

to manage underlying risks, save lives and livelihoods, 

and ultimately end hunger. WFP will select the 
appropriate tool or mix of tools based on a rigorous analysis of needs and context, people™s preferences, 
and evidence of potential impact.The Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) does not articulate WFP™s resourcing projections, funding and shortfalls. 
Country Strategic Plans will serve as the vehicle 
for resource mobilization and fund management, 
including WFP™s commitment to the guidelines and 
procedures regarding the allocation of multilateral 
contributions for development assistance.3 Over the term of the Strategic Plan, WFP expects resource

61. In September 2015, world leaders came together 
to establish a comprehensive framework for 
global action to achieve sustainable development 
in its three dimensions Œ economic, social and 
environmental Œ in a balanced and integrated manner. Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development sets forth a people-centred global framework for achieving 

sustainable development and ending poverty, 
hunger and inequality. The 2030 Agenda embraces
 the Secretary-General™s Zero Hunger Challenge 


2 (SDG 2) Œ End hunger, achieve food security 
and improved nutrition and promote sustainable 
agriculture. The 2030 Agenda situates 
humanitarian efforts within a broader context of 
human progress and development, with a strong 
commitment to leaving no one behind.2. The 2030 Agenda is ambitious in its reach, in the 
complexity of the challenges to be overcome and in its 15-year timeframe for achieving sustained results that will transform the world. Action 
is needed now: the goals require accelerated 
action to end poverty and hunger by 2030. Multi 
stakeholder engagement is crucial. 3. Responding to the 2030 Agenda™s global call 

to action,4 the WFP Secretariat is exceptionally submitting the 2017Œ2021 Strategic Plan one

(2017Œ2021) is fully aligned with the 2030 
Agenda and is intended to remain stable throughout
 its implementation. In this context, while recognizing

7 that WFP must plan and perform the humanitarian 
work required to help save lives, the vision of 
this Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) is to ensure 
that countries are on track for achieving the 
2030 Agenda, in particular SDG 2 on zero hunger. As per standard practice, the Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) will be subject to a mid-term 
review. Lessons learned will generate further 
guidance on how collective, coherent action can 
increase progress. To ensure that the Strategic

Aid Effectiveness8 will be respected. Strategic partnerships, communication and advocacy, and the development of staff awareness and capacity will be necessary to realize the Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021). In addition, to achieve the vision and goals of the Strategic Plan in a constantly 
changing world, it will be crucial for WFP to leverage 

and strengthen innovation efforts, including 
through the WFP Innovation Accelerator.95. WFP™s mandate allows it to apply development 

tools and perspectives to its humanitarian 
responses, providing communities with early 
recovery and development-enabling interventions 

that help build resilience and contribute to productive opportunities over the long term. As a result of this mandate, WFP™s experience in both humanitarian and development contexts has allowed it to establish unique strengths 
and capacities to support food security and 
nutrition, including in contexts of protracted 
crises. In keeping with the 2030 Agenda, as WFP 
focuses on its core business of saving lives, it must do so in ways that contribute to outcomes that provide productive opportunities over the longer term, working collaboratively across institutional boundaries at the humanitarianŒ
development and peace-building nexus, in line 
with the policy10 on WFP™s role in peace-building in transition settings, while ensuring that it does 
not deviate from the primacy of humanitarian 
principles. During discussions held at the World 
Humanitarian Summit some countries raised the importance to shrink humanitarian needs over the long-term in a manner which contributes to the outcomes of the SDGs. Prevention, mitigation and preparedness for early action are 
critical. The Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) provides 

contributions in these areas in different contexts. 6 A/RES/47/168.7 E/RES/2016/9.

people are more vulnerable than others, face greater challenges in achieving sustainable 
development, and require special attention to 
ensure that no one is left behind.12 Rather humanitarian action, Heads of State and

affected by humanitarian crises. In 2014 and 
2015, WFP provided direct food assistance to 
an average of more than 78 million people per 
year in 82 countries. Some 42 percent of its expenditure was on emergency operations, 38.5 percent on early recovery activities, 6.9 
percent on development activities and 7.6 
percent on special operations.15 In 2014 and 2015, on average 77 percent of food transfers 
and 89 percent of cash based transfers (CBTs) went to saving lives and protecting livelihoods in emergencies, in direct support of 59.5 
ensured that the food security of emergency-
affected populations was stabilized or improved through general distributions of food, or CBTs, which increased food consumption and dietary 
diversity. Activities were also conducted to 
prevent nutritional deterioration and related 
mortality, and to support acutely malnourished 
people in emergencies. 10. In more stable situations, WFP supported 

smallholder farmers by transforming its 
local procurement into a tool for addressing hunger, working with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and 
other partners. These catalytic market creation 
activities enabled the economic development 
of smallholder farmers by improving crop 
quality and increasing sales to WFP, and Œ even 
more importantly Œ to other more sustainable 
commercial and government buyers. In 
situations of early recovery, WFP worked to improve the food security of vulnerable communities and households by providing food 
or cash-based transfers, while helping local 
communities to rehabilitate land and build 
or rebuild dams and wells, feeder roads and 
other assets. In diverse contexts, WFP worked 
to reduce vulnerable households™ exposure to climate change and disasters by helping food-insecure communities prepare for, respond to and recover from climate-related disasters. In the last decade, almost half of WFP™s emergency and recovery operations included response 
years, at least 40 percent of WFP™s operations included activities to reduce disaster risk. WFP has supported governments in building their capacity to manage disaster risk and improve 
food security, while investing in early warning 
and preparedness systems. WFP has also helped 
ensure adequate access to nutritious food for 
children through school meal programmes, 
which supported an average of about 18 million children in 64 countries in 2014 and 2015.11. WFP responded to 13 major emergencies in 2014 
and 12 major emergencies in 2015. Current 
crises risk are increasing the number of people living in hunger, and indicate that it will remain 
necessary for WFP to continue to maintain a 
strong focus on saving lives and livelihoods in 
emergencies if it is to help countries achieve 
the 2030 Agenda. Climate change threatens 
to break down food systems by increasing 
frequency and severity of natural hazards, with 
a disproportionate impact on vulnerable food-
insecure households. The global community cannot and should not keep saving the same lives every year. Climate justice16 and the 2030 Agenda call for collective responsibility 
to perform the adaptation and mitigation work 
that will help build the resilience of marginalized people living in vulnerable places. The continued 
leading to increased displacement and growing  peaceful solution in sight, create the quintessential 

oxymoron of ever longer lasting protracted 
emergencies requiring broad based humanitarian 
assistance, and offering little if any space for 
productive sustainable development activity.15

 report from 201517 states: ﬁOver the past 30 years, the typology of crises has gradually evolved from catastrophic, short-term, acute and highly 
visible events to more structural, longer-term 
and protracted situations [–]. In other words, protracted crises have become the new norm, while acute short-term crises are now the exception.ﬂ The Committee on World Food Security (CFS) adopted the Framework for Action for Food Security and Nutrition in Protracted 
Crises (CFS-FFA) in 2015,18 in recognition of the impact on affected populations of food insecurity and undernutrition. WFP has unique strengths and capacities for responding to affected populations in protracted crises, and for acting on the principles set out by the CFS-FFA. WFP™s

development contexts, which makes it well suited 

to help strengthen the resilience of affected 
people in protracted crises by also applying a 
development lens in its humanitarian response, and by aligning its recovery and development interventions accordingly. 13. The 2030 Agenda recognizes that concurrent 
action in different contexts and across sectors 
is required. By addressing their interconnected 
root causes, poverty and hunger can be ended 
forever. This is critical wherever hunger is found, and resonates with the 2030 Agenda™s disaster, risk and vulnerability. Supporting the 2030 Agenda, actions to end hunger include the 
outcome documents of important United Nations 
conferences and summits.14. The World Humanitarian Summit deliberations 

focused the attention on the scale of changes 
required to address the magnitude of challenges before us. Trends in climate-related disasters, that the world will see an increasing number of complex and protracted crises in the coming assistance alone cannot adequately address the 
needs of the world™s most vulnerable people. 
A coherent approach is required to sustainably 
address the root causes of crisis, including 

resolution, and integrating humanitarian, 
development and peace building efforts.19

needs must be met by adequate and predictable 
donor base. Unrestricted humanitarian access, the humanitarian principles and the international protection standards were underscored as imperative; there is an urgent need to uphold 
and promote them. Participants also resolved

cross borders and surpass the capacity of any 
single country or institution to cope and there

regional institutions to confront these challenges effectively.17. WFP fully supports a common, people-centred, 
needs-driven approach that is guided by a strong 
commitment to the humanitarian principles, 
in accordance with the relevant resolutions 
of the United Nations, in particular, General 
Assembly Resolution 46/182. WFP is committed

Climate Change Paris Agreement (December 
2015): Climate change has a disproportionately negative impact on food insecure people,22 and could increase the risk of hunger and 
malnutrition by up to 20 percent by 2050.23 Climate change will deepen vulnerability to 
disasters,24 especially in resource-scarce environments dominated by high prevalence 
of food insecurity and malnutrition. Floods and 
droughts are more frequent and intense. The 
vulnerability of people and food production 
systems to climate change will require greater 
efforts and capacity strengthening in early 
warning systems, emergency preparedness, 
comprehensive risk assessment and 
management, climate risk insurance, and 
resilience building of communities, livelihoods 
and ecosystems. Safety nets and social 
protection systems are among the best options 
for empowering the most vulnerable people so that they can start adapting to climate change and building resilience. In this regard, it will 
be crucial for WFP to integrate support to the 
national COP21 action plans with WFP™s Country 
Strategic Planning approach.Ł The United Nations Summit for Refugees and

Individual countries cannot solve these issues on 
their own. International cooperation and action to address large movements of refugees and migrants must be strengthened. In September 2016, the United Nations General Assembly hosted a high-level summit to address this issue 
by strengthening governance of international 
migration and creating a more responsible, predictable system for responding to large 
movements of refugees and migrants.Ł Third United Nations Conference on Housing 

and Sustainable Urban Development (HABITAT III) (October 2016): Hunger and malnutrition among the urban poor are recognized as a challenge to achievement of the 2030 Agenda: 
rapid urbanization is steadily increasing the 
number of slum dwellers; extremely poor urban 
households spend a large part of their income 
on food, making them especially vulnerable to 
sudden price shocks or bottlenecks in supply; 

people into urban areas. Improving access to 
basic services including safety nets and nutrition 

services will be critical to reducing urban hunger. 

The New Urban Agenda25 unanimously adopted by Member States is a global agreement 
dedicated to addressing the challenge of 
unprecedented and rapid urbanization within the framework of the 2030 Agenda. 20. The 2030 Agenda and the Strategic Plan (2017Œ

other resolutions by the United Nations General 
Assembly, including the annual resolution on 
agriculture development, food security and 
nutrition to which WFP contributes with FAO

recommendations were as follows: Ł  WFP™s mission and mandate overlap in global 
policy agendas and corporate objectives. The new Strategic Plan should provide a tight conceptual framework and focus WFP™s 
work, using the transition to the SDGs as an 
opportunity to do so.Ł  The move to food assistance has shown positive 
results and should be consolidated, using the Country Strategic Plans (CSPs) to articulate WFP™s comparative advantage at the country level more clearly. Ł  The Financial Framework Review should provide

commitments and expectations in emergency 
response and recovery in contexts of crisis and 

rate food assistance interventions designed 
and implemented in partnership with national 
governments, international agencies and other this critical dimension of WFP™s work, ensuring that it is maintained and strengthened. By aligning WFP™s work with the 2030 Agenda, the 
Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) also provides a 
coherent and transparent framework for WFP to 
make broader contributions towards the SDGs 
in several contexts, using the skills, capacities 
and competencies that WFP has built up through 
humanitarian action and development initiatives. These capacities, and competencies Œ which spring from WFP™s mandate Œ are unique, 


a new generation of systemic interventions and 
partnerships motivated by the transformative spirit of the 2030 Agenda. WFP™s existing 
portfolio of innovative policies and effective 
operations implemented in a range of contexts 
represent a potent contribution to a world 
seeking not only to end hunger and develop sustainably, but also to do so in ways that leave no one behind, strengthening capacities and 
building resilience along the way. The Strategic 
Plan (2017Œ2021) articulates a framework for 
realizing this opportunity.27. As articulated in the WFP Corporate Partnership 

Strategy (2014Œ2017),31 WFP aligns and integrates its food assistance capacities and 
programmes with interventions and investments 
of governments, other United Nations agencies 
and actors from the private sector and civil society, which can together generate the deep systemic changes required for sustainable 
development. WFP will work with these partners 
to combine and leverage complementary 
strengths and resources. The objective will be 

arrangements with mechanisms for sharing risks, 
responsibilities and accountability. By aligning with existing approaches, these partnerships 31 WFP/EB.A/2014/5-B.

Support of the 2030 Agenda
17will support the needs of food-insecure people cost-effectively. Commitment to partnership 
and collective action has long been central to 
WFP™s operations and is at the heart of the 2030 
Agenda™s global call to action. The Strategic commitment. In addition to these strategic 
and operational partnerships, innovation, 
communication and advocacy, and development 
of staff awareness and capacity will be crucial for 
delivering on the Strategic Plan.28. WFP fully embraces the vision set in the 2030 

Agenda for a world free from hunger in a context 
of equitable and environmentally responsible 

history and mandate, and recognizing that all 
17 SDGs are interconnected, WFP prioritizes two 
SDGs Œ SDG 2 on achieving zero hunger and SDG 17 on partnering to support implementation 
of the SDGs Œ while contributing to other SDGs 
depending on country contexts and national 

as set out in United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1714 of 196132 and subsequent mission statements, and its strengths, capacities and potential as demonstrated in its programme 
of work and the demand for its technical and 
operational services, common services and capacities. In its operations, WFP will keep a strong focus on saving lives and livelihoods in emergencies, leveraging its many recognized strengths in humanitarian and crisis settings. The 
ultimate goal of the Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) 
is to support countries to end hunger. Figure 1 illustrates the results framework for the Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021).32 A/RES/1714(XVI). In particular, paragraph 10 of the resolution: 
 ﬁIn the administration of the programme attention should be paid to:

 (c) implementing a pilot project, with the multilateral use of food as an aid to economic and social development, particularly when related to labour-intensive 

projects and rural welfare.ﬂFigure 1: WFP Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) results framework1833

of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence, and that WFP will rely on its partners and all other actors to respect the humanitarian nature of its work.30. Other relevant policies for the Strategic Plan 

(2017Œ2021) include the ﬁPolicy on Capacity 
Developmentﬂ36 the 2012 ﬁHumanitarian Protection Policyﬂ,37 and ﬁGender Policy  (2015Œ2020)ﬂ,

minimizing human suffering and economic loss. Other relevant policies include the 2015 ﬁSouthŒSouth and Triangular cooperation Policyﬂ40 and the 2013 ﬁRevised School Feeding Policyﬂ.41  31. The compendium is updated every year and 
submitted to the Board for information. It 
highlights policies that have been replaced by new ones; potential gaps for policies; and policies that need to be updated in the context of a new Strategic Plan Œ for example, the Nutrition Policy,42 the Corporate Partnership Strategy (2014Œ2017)43 and WFP™s People Strategy,44 which is a ﬁPeople Management Framework for Achieving WFP™s Strategic Planﬂ. Corporate 
policies on environmental impact, and climate 
change-related food assistance measures will also be presented to the Board for approval during the course of this Strategic Plan. WFP™s food assistance interventions will be based on comprehensive food security and vulnerability analysis tools and guidelines that identify food-
insecure and vulnerable households, identify 
the root causes of hunger, analyse the risks and 
emerging vulnerabilities among populations in crisis prone countries, make recommendations on the best response and transfer modality options to target the neediest populations, and to 
inform preparedness for reduced hunger.PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ROME-BASED AGENCIES AND WITHIN THE UNITED NATIONS 
DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM32. Enhanced synergies among the Rome-based 
agencies (RBA) are paramount to achieving SDG 2. RBA collaboration is particularly relevant 
when adapted to country context to maximize 
each agency™s complementary capacities and 

have been made to enhance RBA collaboration. This progress must be strengthened for effective SDG 2 results. As noted in the RBA paper on Collaboration among the United Nations Rome-based Agencies: Delivering on the 2030 Agenda,45 WFP is committed to working with FAO and IFAD by capturing all available 
synergies and complementarities and avoiding 
overlaps to contribute to collective results across 
humanitarian and development contexts, and to enhance RBA advocacy on food security and nutrition at the global level and within the 
broader United Nations system.19

United Nations Children™s Fund (UNICEF) and 

Affairs (OCHA), as requested by the Secretary-
General in his report46 on the QCPR™s operational activities for development of the UNDS. The 2030 Agenda requires the UNDS to pursue more integrated approaches and create cross-sectoral synergies to deliver interlinked results at all levels, supported by an enabling funding 
and governance architecture. The UNDS 
recognizes that its primary focus should be 
on facilitating the achievement of interlinked 
and transformative results at the country level 
and promoting national ownership. To that 
end, UNDS has renewed its commitment to delivering together across mandates, sectors and institutional boundaries, working within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations and using more integrated and interconnected 
approaches. Planning and implementation 
of WFP™s country-level activities with UNDS 
partners, especially FAO and IFAD, will continue 
to be a priority for achieving zero hunger and avoiding programme overlap and duplication.STRATEGIC GOAL 1Support Countries to Achieve Zero Hunger34. Strategic Goal 1 is in line with SDG 2 Œ End

mandate, no single agency or entity owns any 
of the SDGs, and partnerships will be required 
to achieve progress. Partnerships beyond 
and across sectors and areas of expertise are essential Œ within countries and among their SDG partners such as UNICEF, FAO and IFAD. WFP 
will also build strategic alliances with partners 
who will support advocacy, policy and a deeper 
understanding of SDG 2.37. Progress towards SDG 2 contributes to many 

other SDGs. It is also dependent on progress 
in other SDGs. WFP will collaborate with partners, including FAO and IFAD, to leverage each one™s capacities and strengths to achieve 
the SDGs. Relevant in this regard are SDGs 
that affect access to food, nutrition and food 
availability. Goals relevant to access to food

and given the strong imperative for enhanced 
partnership under the 2030 Agenda, WFP will

and a lack of participation in decision-making. 
challenge for many food-insecure people. Markets and income are essential in ensuring that 
all people everywhere have access to nutritious 
food for healthy lives. When people lack income because of unemployment, poor health, gender inequalities or disability, appropriate means 
of social protection are necessary to ensure 
that they and their families have access to 
food. Economic growth must be inclusive and 
equitable, providing sustainable jobs and 
advancing equality. Conditional safety nets such as school meals programmes constitute income nutrition and education for children.Ł Other goals relevant to access to food include SDG 
8 on promoting sustained and inclusive economic growth and SDG 10 on reducing inequality.NutritionŁ SDG 6 on ensuring clean water and sanitation 

and SDG 3 on ensuring healthy lives and well-
being are essential to improved nutrition. 
Access to clean water and sanitation prevents 
the spread of diarrhoea and other diseases that prevent people™s bodies from utilizing food effectively, leading to malnutrition. For good nutrition to be effective, HIV treatment with anti-retroviral therapy, and malaria and tuberculosis 
prevention and treatment may be required. Ł SDG 4 on ensuring quality education
 enhances people™s ability to adapt their nutrition, hygiene, 
sanitation and health practices, and to demand 
appropriate services. As part of the essential package for schoolchildren™s health and nutrition, school meals programmes help ensure that 
children have access to education and support 
achievement of education improvement targets, 
despite crises or chronic poverty, and support 
improved nutrition through the provision of 

access to quality education and together with 
nutritious foods through schools contributes to breaking the intergenerational cycle of hunger.Food availability and marketsŁ SDG 12 on ensuring responsible consumption

restricting people™s access to markets. Climate 
change also increases health threats, posing 
further risks to nutrition status. Without rapid, inclusive and climate-smart development including resilience programmes, where appropriate delivered in partnership with WFP,  many more people will be affected by poverty

empowering all women and girls: 
Gender equality 

and women™s empowerment affect all aspects

bear the primary responsibility for feeding their families. Ending all forms of discrimination, violence and harmful practices against women and girls; ensuring women™s full and effective participation at all levels of decision-making; and 
recognizing, valuing and redistributing unpaid 
care and domestic work are fundamental to 
achieving the 2030 Agenda. Gender equality is 
essential for all women, men, girls and boys to achieve zero hunger. WFP will ensure that gender

STRATEGIC GOAL 2Partner to Support Implementation of the SDGs38. Strategic Goal 2 aligns with SDG 17 Œ 
Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the 
global partnership for sustainable development. 
SDG 17 is focused on how the SDGs can be achieved by using multi-stakeholder partnerships to enable collective and coherent action that 

and institutional support for implementation. 
SDG 17 urges all stakeholders to continue to 
learn, innovate and transform, particularly 
as they work together to achieve the 2030 
of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, especially those of particular relevance to ending hunger, 
namely: sustained resource investments, 
particularly in social protection and disaster 
risk reduction; private-sector partnerships; 
international development cooperation, especially 
SouthŒSouth cooperation among developing 
countries; addressing systemic issues; and 
science, technology, innovation and capacity 
development. 39. Given the fundamental importance of working 

across sectors and involving all stakeholders 
in the 2030 Agenda, Strategic Goal 2 covers 
both how WFP implements actions towards SDG 
2 and how it supports other stakeholders in contributing to efforts to achieve all the SDGs: 23Ł Means of implementation
 Œ support partnership-based efforts to strengthen capacities and improve the integration and coherence of actions 
towards the SDGs, including by facilitating 
consultative platforms, providing common services, enabling SouthŒSouth and triangular cooperation, engaging in local community based 
partnerships, supporting centres of excellence, 
and acting collectively with the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), UNICEF, the 
World Bank, FAO, IFAD and others (Targets 
17.9, 17.14 and 17.18; and SDG 2 means of implementation 2a and 2c).Ł Revitalize global partnerships
 Œ support stakeholders, including United Nations agencies, regional bodies, the private sector and local 
communities, in joining collective action towards 
the SDGs, including through SouthŒSouth and triangular cooperation among developing countries and the provision of common services 
(Targets 17.3, 17.6, 17.16 and 17.17). 40. Achieving zero hunger requires WFP to act as 

part of a system by helping to shape the way in which partners interact and relate to each other. 
WFP™s agility in responding to humanitarian24 needs, its ability to innovate and learn and its 
willingness to act when called on by its partners are recognized as core strengths that support 

partners™ responses to increasing and more complex humanitarian needs. The Addis Ababa 
Action Agenda points to the wide range of stakeholders, including the private sector, that 
are critical for the innovation and transformation that, together with humanitarian response, are 

necessary to achieve the 2030 Agenda.49 41. Building on progress made through the Zero Hunger Challenge, WFP will develop platforms for outreach, engagement and advocacy. This 
will include providing a clear voice on how WFP 
is positioned globally and at the country level, 
and providing communications channels to 
support and mobilize partners, stakeholders 
and advocates to work together to achieve zero 
hunger. 42. The private sector is already taking action 

to advance the 2030 Agenda while creating 
opportunities for growth, cost reduction and 
improved management of risk. Innovative 
technologies and approaches to resilience are 

and platforms and services for the billion 
poorest people. WFP needs partnerships with 
the private sector to improve its work in such 
services for the poor and food security. For 
example, WFP uses mobile technology for real-
time food security assessments and monitoring 
(mVAM). Through private partnerships, WFP and

with member governments, the World Bank, 
FAO, IFAD, UNDP, UNICEF, UNHCR and other 
United Nations agencies, civil society and 
local communities. To contribute better to 
SDG 17, WFP will also support transformative 
partnerships, enabling the private sector to play more active roles in ensuring food security and nutrition, while maintaining due diligence and accountability in its selection of and engagement with partners. WFP STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND WFP STRATEGIC RESULTS44. In line with the two Strategic Goals, WFP has 

elements of SDG 2 and SDG 17 addressed by WFP. The Strategic Objectives frame WFP™s programmatic and operational focus, and provide 
links between the Strategic Goals and the eight 
Strategic Results that connect WFP to country 
and global efforts through relevant SDG 2 and 
SDG 17 targets. 45. Underpinning WFP™s capacities and mandate Strategic Results focus WFP™s responses on what countries need. Strategic Results are mapped to the SDG 2 and SDG 17 targets that are relevant 
to WFP™s capacities and mandate in helping to 
end hunger and in supporting partnerships for 
sustainable development. Through this mapping, 
the Strategic Results align WFP™s support to 
national and global efforts on the SDGs. WFP 
Strategic Results will be measured by the SDG indicators of the related SDG targets (see Annex

and as part of the solution. WFP will ensure 
that women and men equitably participate in

violence, including gender-based discrimination 
and harmful practices against women and girls. 
In addition to its commitment to gender equality and women™s empowerment, WFP will work to 
integrate humanitarian protection concerns and 
accountability to affected populations in all its 

vulnerabilities of different groups, including women, men, girls, boys, elderly persons, persons with disabilities, or others.48. The parameters and contexts, including

to support hunger-related safety nets, such 
as school meals programmes, and productive safety nets that protect access while promoting nutrition, livelihoods and asset creation.Ł Leveraging its vast global expertise in supporting 

different social protection schemes all over the world, WFP will work to strengthen countries™ 
capacities to provide social protection measures 
that protect access to adequate, nutritious and 
safe food for all.Ł Activities designed and implemented with partners towards Strategic Result 1 will include unconditional resource transfers to 
support access to food; asset creation and 
livelihood support; school meals; individual 
capacity strengthening; institutional capacity 
strengthening; and emergency preparedness.Ł In contexts where viable, inclusive, safe and 

reliable commercial alternatives for enhancing access to food are available, WFP will assess the needs for these activities and will support actors 
who are better placed to contribute to ensuring 
access to nutritious foods for all, all year round, 

stable and rewarding.STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 2Improve nutritionStrategic Result 2: No one suffers from malnutrition. 
By 2030 no one is malnourished, and by 2025 
the internationally agreed targets on stunting and 
wasting in children are met (SDG Target 2.2). 50. WFP will support joint and coordinated collective 
efforts that are essential to end all forms of 
malnutrition, and will support governments 
to strengthen national capacities in multi-
sectoral nutrition activities. It will also enhance 
partnerships with other public and private 
actors, and will continue to engage in nutrition 
governance and to invest in country level action through multi stakeholder platforms such as the United Nations Standing Committee on Nutrition, 
the CFS, the Scaling Up Nutrition movement, 
and the Renewed Efforts Against Child Hunger 2728and undernutrition (REACH) approach. WFP will work on this Strategic Objective and Strategic 
Result in partnership with UNICEF, the World 
Health Organization (WHO), the Joint United 
Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), UNHCR, the World Bank, FAO and IFAD, among other partners. In humanitarian operations, 
WFP will work through relevant coordinating 
mechanisms such as the Inter-Agency Standing 
Committee (IASC) nutrition cluster, including 
international and national civil society partners.Ł Helping to eliminate malnutrition, particularly in 

contexts of high burden or high risk, is central to WFP™s work. Malnutrition has a huge impact on human development, contributing to the persistence of poverty and inequality through 
the intergenerational cycle of hunger.Ł WFP will support countries™ capacities in 


quality nutrition services to treat and prevent 
malnutrition. WFP will emphasize a preventive approach to malnutrition, focusing on facilitating access to nutritious diets required by vulnerable 
groups, helping to provide the foundation for 
sustainable development.Ł WFP will leverage all its assistance and 

activities to deliver improved nutrition 
outcomes by strengthening nutrition-sensitive approaches, and by working with partners using complementary approaches across sectors Œ such as strengthening social protection systems, strengthening capacity and supportive legislation 
for enhanced public and private demand for 



improving health and education, increasing 
smallholder productivity, reducing post-harvest 
losses, and ensuring sanitation and hygiene. Ł Recognizing that nutritional status both 

determines and is determined by multi-sectoral 
and cross-cutting factors, WFP will design 
programmes with a clear understanding of how 
nutrition is affected by gender equality, lack of women™s empowerment and other drivers of malnutrition that cut across sectors.Ł Activities designed and implemented with partners
 towards Strategic Result 2 will include nutrition treatment; malnutrition prevention; unconditional 
resource transfers to support access to food; 
school meals; individual capacity strengthening; 
and institutional capacity strengthening.Ł WFP™s contributions will focus on ensuring that 

diets which meet the nutrient needs of targeted 
vulnerable groups are available, accessible and 
consumed. Activities will focus on improving 
access to nutritious foods to complement 
the work of other actors focusing on food 29production and of organizations with specialized mandates and capacities to address the non-
food determinants of malnutrition. WFP will 
seek context-based opportunities to work with 
partners to adjust the targeting of programmes, provide complementary support to healthy diets, align with national nutrition strategies, 
and will ﬁco-locateﬂ its programmes with those 
of partners to address multisectoral drivers of 
malnutrition. WFP will implement these activities 
where vulnerable groups do not have diets that 
meet their nutrient needs.STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE 3Achieve food securityStrategic Result 3: Smallholders have improved food security and nutrition through improved productivity and incomes. By 2030, smallholders™ have higher incomes and greater productivity than in 2015, supporting improved food security and nutrition (SDG Target 2.3) and
Strategic Result 4: Food systems are sustainable. 
By 2030, food systems are sustainable and utilize 
resilient practices that help maintain ecosystems; 
strengthen capacities for adaptation to climate 
change, extreme weather and disasters; and progressively improve land and soil quality (SDG Target 2.4).51. WFP has two reasons to engage. Smallholder 
farmers and their families account for a whose direct needs are addressed under Strategic Objectives 1 and 2. Additionally, 
WFP can51power and experience to increase smallholder 
farmers™ access to markets, both directly and 
by mainstreaming learning and best practices 
across the organization. Working with FAO, IFAD and others, WFP will continue these efforts seeking to raise awareness and catalyse policy 
reform and institutional innovation and capacity 
development to address hunger from the 
demand-side of food systems. Operating at the 
intersection of commercial food markets and the 
public interest represented by food assistance, 
WFP™s demand for food and food system services can be a direct and indirect force for enhanced performance of food systems, contributing to inclusive agricultural growth, sustainable social and economic transformation and broad-based 
food security. Given that in many countries the 
bulk of food available in local markets originates 
from smallholder farms, WFP™s procurement 
footprint in these markets can provide a basis for 
partnerships with governments and the private sector to catalyze demand-driven platforms that enable smallholders to have sustainable beyond WFP. Under Strategic Objective 3, WFP™s

30activities will be directly related to achieving food security and nutrition outcomes.Ł Focusing on the most vulnerable people and 
communities, WFP will support partners to promote livelihoods and resilience-building linked to food security and nutrition, climate change 
adaptation, risk management, and strengthened 
sustainability and resilience of food systems. 
WFP will continue to collaborate with FAO 
and IFAD on joint strategies, implementation 
and advocacy, including in areas related to supporting countries™ efforts in sustainable food production, where WFP relies on the core strengths of FAO, IFAD and others. WFP will also work on this Strategic Objective and these Strategic Results in partnership with UNDP, 
UNHCR, the World Bank, the United Nations 

amongst others to support national programmes 
and services. WFP will also contribute to related 
coordinating mechanisms such as the CFS and 
the Food Security Information Network. Other major partners include international and national civil society entities.Ł Food systems are changing rapidly and 

profoundly as a result of such forces as 
urbanization, changing consumer diets, 
and supply chain integration due to capital-
intensive technology change and expanded use of digital devices and Internet access. Food system transformation is embedded in broader transformations of rural areas and wider economies, including urban areas.52 In both humanitarian and development contexts, WFP 
will work in synergy with partners to design and 
implement food assistance activities that address systemic problems rooted in these transforming food systems, aiming to expand the scope for 
hunger reduction in broader structural and rural 
transformation processes.Ł Situations of recurrent crisis in which food-
insecure communities live in damaged or fragile 
environments and are exposed to high levels of shock are recognized as a major challenge to the achievement of zero hunger. WFP will use analytical tools to facilitate a cross-sectoral understanding of disaster risks and of opportunities for enhancing livelihoods, climate resilience and nutrition, in line with government™s 
provisions. This analytical process will help 
partners engage in sustained efforts to build 
resilience for food security and nutrition. Similar 
tools will also help partners support communities 
by guiding efforts to enhance their resilience for food security and nutrition.Ł WFP™s long experience in humanitarian and 

development contexts has established strengths 
for the organization in supporting the building 
of resilience for food security and nutrition. 
WFP will support national efforts in disaster risk 
reduction and climate resilience that facilitate the achievement of zero hunger, using innovative 
early warning systems with early response 
mechanisms, and implementing programmes 
that create productive assets, promote the 
production of nutritionally diverse foods, diversify 
livelihood strategies and rehabilitate natural 
resources.Ł Enhancing the marketing, productivity and livelihood opportunities of smallholders is a powerful way to improve food security and 
nutrition. Strengthened capacity for risk 
management is especially important. WFP™s 
demand-side programmes for supporting 
smallholders™ access to agricultural markets 
leverage its procurement footprint and expertise 
in agricultural markets Œ and those of other public and private buyers Œ to contribute to building resilient food systems, the production 
and processing of nutritionally diverse foods, 
pro-smallholder aggregation systems, improved 
post-harvest management and catalysing 
sustainable commercial and institutional market 
development for smallholders.52

(SDG Target 17.16). 53. Commitments by global leaders in the 2030 
Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda 
and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk 
Reduction, as well as the World Humanitarian 
Summit™s deliberations, stress the critical importance of enhanced roles for governments

face complex challenges in generating the 
required quantity and quality of investment. 
WFP™s long experience in developing effective 
partnerships with public and private actors 

activities Œ including technological and institutional innovation Œ can add value to country efforts to build the required coalitions for investment and action. WFP delivers food assistance to save lives in emergencies and eradicate hunger in all its forms, leveraging its 
supply chain capabilities and purchasing power to strengthen national markets and capacities. The organization often also acts as the provider of choice for supply chain services for governments and humanitarian and development partners, 
using its supply chain expertise in modality

optimization and innovative contracting to deliver 
more with less while retaining reliability, cost

to fast-evolving complex crises through large 

logistics, supply chain and telecommunications 

operations are a key strength of the organization. 

The common services WFP provides through such 
operations are of crucial importance in supporting 
country, regional and global efforts to respond to humanitarian crises. WFP will continue to provide 
high-quality and timely services to governments 
and humanitarian partners in emergency 
preparedness as leader of the IASC logistics 
and emergency telecommunications clusters; as 
manager of UNHRD and UNHAS; and through 
provision of sustainable engineering solutions for humanitarian needs.

of countries and regional bodies are seeking 
WFP™s support to the development of innovative 



security and improved nutrition at the household, 
community, national, and regional levels. WFP will continue to respond to these demands, focusing on enhancing capacity for effective risk 
management and preparedness at multiple levels 
of aggregation. Examples of such efforts include 
WFP™s support to the African Union™s Africa Risk 
Capacity (ARC) mutual insurance initiative that 
aims to improve current responses to climate-
related food security emergencies by providing member countries with rapid funds in the event 
of natural disasters, and the R4 Rural Resilience 
Initiative (R4) comprehensive risk management

Results, and taking into account local context 
and priorities, WFP will contribute to national 
SDG targets through a set of WFP Strategic Outcomes related to each Strategic Result. WFP

situation and dynamics of a country, they need to be appropriate to the national context, resonate with national and subnational actors 
and show clear alignment with national priorities 
and goals. Individual strategic outcomes vary 
from country to country in pitch and formulation, 
but they all show a clear link to the achievement 
of a national SDG target, and hence also a 
WFP Strategic Result. Importantly, Strategic Outcomes cannot be achieved by WFP on its own. Achievement of Strategic Outcomes requires strengthened coordinated and concerted 
efforts, led by government stakeholders and 
encompassing all partners, including the RBAs 
and other entities of the UNDS. 57. WFP Strategic Outcomes are linked to national 

SDG targets in a robust results framework in 
line with QCPR recommendations54 and ECOSOC decisions. This results framework is based on 
the results chain in Figure 1, showing how the 
impact level of Strategic Goals and related 
Strategic Objectives will be achieved through the Strategic Results, which are elaborated at the country level through a set of WFP Strategic Outcomes generated from the organization™s outputs. Outputs relate to what WFP™s activities 
are, what and how much they deliver, and who

activities within a humanitarian intervention.
36LINKING WFP™S WORK TO OTHER SDG TARGETS58. While WFP™s point of departure is its work to achieve zero hunger Œ SDG 2 Œ the interrelated challenges and solutions involved in ending hunger and poverty mean that WFP will directly and indirectly contribute to most of the other 
SDGs. WFP™s primary focus on ending hunger 
will serve as the entry point and rationale for 
contributing to SDGs other than SDG 2. 59. For example, in supporting or implementing 
school meals programmes, WFP might contribute to SDG 2 targets related to access to food, 
improved nutrition or smallholder livelihoods, 
while also often making substantial contributions 
to the achievement of other SDG targets, 
including those related to education (SDG 4), 
gender equality and women™s empowerment 
(SDG 5), family income (SDG 1) and health (SDG 

3). In Côte d™Ivoire in 2016, for example, with support from the McGovern Dole programme, 
WFP provided daily hot meals to 125,000 children 
in 613 public primary schools in the country™s 
most vulnerable regions, while also fostering the 
capacity of women farmers to supply food for 
the programme. Such a programme contributes 
to the country™s national education and gender 
equality results while also supporting health 
results related to dietary practices.60. In support of SDG 17, and in close consultation 

and collaboration with relevant stakeholders, 
WFP may respond to a request from a national 
government and partners to provide services 
that are not directly related to zero hunger 
efforts but that support achievement of the 
2030 Agenda goals and match WFP™s strengths 
and capacity to assist. Throughout the regional Ebola crisis of 2014Œ2015, for example, WFP worked in all affected countries, providing vital logistics and engineering support to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the humanitarian 
community, including storage, procurement, 
transport, logistics hubs in or near the capital cities, 

and 11 forward logistics bases in the three countries. 
61. WFP™s contributions to other SDGs will be 

captured at the country level by linking WFP 
Outputs to the outcomes of national and other 
partners that are related to SDG targets other 
BOUNDARIES AND CONTEXT62. Given the broad scope of SDG 2 and SDG 17, 
it is important to articulate the boundaries of WFP™s engagement from a strategic perspective, and not just in response to the challenges or opportunities for involvement that may arise. 
WFP capitalizes on its own resources, knowledge 
and skills within a given context while respecting 
and leveraging the added value of partners. 

towards SDG 2 and SDG 17 in countries that the necessary functions and actions themselves, 
or in contexts where viable, inclusive, safe and 
reliable commercial alternatives are available 
or other actors are better placed to contribute. 
Working with a range of international, regional and
 national partners, WFP aims to support countries 

responsibility for achieving zero hunger. In countries
 that can achieve zero hunger by 2030 without 
assistance, WFP™s presence in the country should 
be phased out. For SDG 17, WFP™s support 
to countries may relate to developmental or 
humanitarian objectives other than zero hunger. 63. WFP may be needed in a country in four broad 

types of situational context:Ł disruption; Ł structural poverty; 
Ł transitions/recovery; and/or
Ł disaster prevention and risk mitigation.
 These contexts often overlap. It is particularly 
important to recognize that the poorest and 
most vulnerable people tend to face frequent disruptions that prevent sustained investments in addressing structural poverty and undermine efforts towards recovery. 37Disruption
enough to interrupt sustainable development at 
the community level. Examples include natural 
disasters, food shortages and price spikes, 
These disruptions lead to two types of situation where support is necessary to save lives and livelihoods: an emergency, when the initial stage after a major shock leads to a life-threatening crisis; and Œ equally important Œ a longer-term 
disruption resulting from a complex crisis such as 

impeding the ability to invest, grow and develop, 
leaving communities unable to cope. When host 
communities and governments are forced to care for displaced populations Œ sometimes for decades Œ capacities are often overwhelmed, 

Structural poverty65. Poverty and hunger continue to exist even when 

there is peace, stability and the ability to invest 
and even in countries with good overall macro 
economic indicators. The ﬁstructuralﬂ nature of this poverty is often related to inadequate social protection polices and systems to reach 
all the people in need and ensure access to 
food. In many cases, this inability perpetuates 
mother-and-child malnutrition, causing an 
intergenerational cycle of hunger that is not 
alleviated by widespread economic growth 
and development. Persistent and structural 
gender inequalities Œ particularly discriminatory institutions, norms and practices that limit opportunities for women to participate in 
education, health, economic and political 

development and overcoming entrenched 
poverty and hunger; it is therefore important to 
understand and shift unequal gender relations. Geographical factors, lack of infrastructure and for governments to provide services in rural areas, particularly to the smallholders who constitute the majority of people living in poverty. However, as urbanization expands in 
developing countries, where the scale of poverty 
and the rate of migration into urban areas often 
overwhelm existing services, leaving the poorest people without access to safety nets. The effects of climate change, ecosystem degradation and 
population growth amplify the challenges faced 
for populations in this context. Strengthening 
resilience of vulnerable households and 
communities will be crucial to counter the effects 
of these stressors. Transitions/recovery66. The process of recovering from a disruption 

typically covers the period after a major shock 

peace and the return and resettlement of displaced populations. Recovery is often not 
a linear process, especially where people and 
communities are very vulnerable, making it 
likely that setbacks will result from even minor 
shocks and stressors. This risk underlines the 
importance of mainstreaming resilience-building, 
especially preparedness, disaster risk reduction and safety nets, in country efforts and all of WFP™s work. In communities and countries that 
do not face high levels of risk, rebuilding should 
be possible if there is sustained investment. Disaster prevention and risk mitigation67. Even communities that have not suffered from 

major disruptions or that are not affected by 
structural poverty can be highly vulnerable 
and at great risk of severe disruptions such as extreme weather events due to climate 

are needed to strengthen the capacity of 
governments and local stakeholders to 
prevent and mitigate risk, especially through 
preparedness, using integrated risk management 
approaches.38SUPPORTING COUNTRY EFFORTS  IN ACHIEVING ZERO HUNGER68. Achieving zero hunger requires a common 
understanding of the contexts of hunger in a 
country and joint agreement on priority actions 
to address these contexts. Local contexts provide 
the parameters for national needs and priorities and for WFP™s strategic engagement and 
partnerships in the country. Context not only
 determines the priorities for action, it also affects 
challenges that partners and people will face in 
achieving zero hunger. All major conferences 
call for collaborative work to respond to local 
contexts, while the 2030 Agenda also emphasizes 

the importance of recognizing that some contexts 

face greater challenges than others and thus have special needs for assistance.5569. The context in each country and each situation 
within a country will involve a complex mix of 
factors, including the political and economic 
situation, social and cultural practices and 
customs, capacity and geography. Different contexts may exist in a single country and vulnerable populations may move from one context to another over time. Context-sensitive responses will require different actions within 
a single country and at different times, in line 
with the differing needs of women, men, girls 
and boys and their communities. It is therefore 
important that partners agree on the context and level. WFP will utilize a wide range of tools, such as VAM and the three pronged approach, 
programmes in close collaboration with partners.THE COUNTRY STRATEGIC PLANS APPROACH70. The 2030 Agenda will be achieved at the 

country level. WFP will work with national 
stakeholders and United Nations country teams 
to determine how best to support national strategies for achieving zero hunger, making the necessary links across sectors and contexts and ensuring coherence with and support to 
countries™ broader strategies for sustainable 
development. The heart of the Strategic Plan 
(2017Œ2021) is therefore WFP™s new country 
strategic planning approach, which consists of 
strategic reviews and Country Strategic Plans. The objectives of the country strategic planning approach are to: i) support countries in making progress towards zero hunger; ii) operationalize the Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) at the country level, including effective emergency response; 
and iii) improve strategic coherence, focus and 
operational effectiveness to support country and 
regional efforts in addressing food insecurity and malnutrition, while maintaining WFP™s commitment to its principles and accountability, and expecting the same from its partners.Country-led strategic reviews that focus on SDG 2
71. WFP will participate in and, where appropriate, 

facilitate nationally led strategic reviews of zero 
hunger challenges and efforts. To be useful and 
meaningful, these country-led strategic reviews should be consultative and comprehensive, with clear and credible analysis of the humanitarian 
and development context identifying the 
challenges a country faces in achieving zero 
hunger, such as gaps in the national policy 
framework and programmes, in the public and 
private funding of the food security and nutrition 
sector, and in the implementation capacities of government and other institutions. The strategic review should facilitate discussion of how the 
country™s partners, including WFP, can support 
the country™s progress towards zero hunger. 
The strategic review and subsequent Country 
Strategic Planning process should be undertaken 
as part of the United Nations country team™s 
efforts to work together, including through 
the Delivering as One approach and/or other 
modalities as appropriate. 72. Based on country-led strategic reviews and

team, WFP will identify the national SDG targets and results that it is well placed to support. WFP 
will determine with the Government and other 
partners the outcomes to which it can contribute 
towards SDG 2 and SDG 17; these WFP Strategic institutions and systems that will be supported to end hunger in the country and region, based on the context when appropriate. WFP Country Strategic Plans 73. To operationalize the Strategic Plan (2017Œ
2021), and to link country-level strategic and 
programme planning and actions to national 
and global efforts to achieve zero hunger, 
WFP™s project categories will be replaced by a Country Strategic Plan.56 The Country Strategic Plan will be WFP™s strategic, programmatic and governance instrument, and will comprise 
WFP™s entire portfolio of activities in a country. As highlighted in previous sections, Country 
Strategic Plans will retain a strong focus on 
saving lives and livelihoods in emergencies to 
help countries achieve zero hunger and related 
goals. WFP™s responses to emergencies will 
be incorporated into Country Strategic Plans, 

to respond quickly, while ensuring that any 
response to crisis invests in recovery and enables long term development. Country Strategic Plans will ensure that the emergency phase and WFP™s 
own role and/or presence are not prolonged 
beyond when they are needed. The country 
strategic plans include policy and programmatic 
activities alongside supply chain and other non 
programmatic support or assistance. Country 
Strategic Plans will:

which WFP will contribute during the CSP period 

Strategic Outcomes that will be supported by 
WFP™s contribution; iii) embed emergency response and preparedness in 

the context of recovery, building resilience and 
supporting longer-term development and provide 
a platform for additional emergency response to 
short-term shocks, if required;iv) identify the capacity-strengthening investments 

required for national partners;v) identify the strategic, resourcing and technical 

support actions that will be taken to maximize WFP™s contributions to national results; andvi) identify appropriate partnerships with 
stakeholders, including United Nations agencies, 
in line with the processes of the United Nations 
Development Assistance Framework, and the 
private sector, national civil society and affected 
communities.74. Country Strategic Plans will help to improve the 
to governments and people in need, including 

advantages of the new approach to country-level 
action include:Ł Coherence for achieving zero hunger. 
Country Strategic Plans will allow the effective translation of WFP™s Strategic Plan into action at country level, aligning WFP operations with national, United Nations and humanitarian response plans, and framing food security and nutrition issues 
into plans and programmes. Greater coherence 
between the Strategic Plan and national zero 
hunger targets will improve WFP programming 
and strategic positioning and help WFP forge 
deeper partnerships with governments, donors, 
the private sector, civil society and others.Ł Flexibility that ensures appropriate planning 

for and responses to dynamic operational 
contexts, including emergency response to rapid onset shocks. Country Strategic Plans

operating environment; promote links between

vulnerability and ways to protect vulnerable 
people in crisis. Ł A robust platform for delivering on commitments 
in agreed areas of engagement and for planning effective exit strategies. Country Strategic Plans ensure targeted institutional capacity strengthening to support governments in designing and managing their nationally owned 
hunger solutions. Ł Consultative processes for increased impact. 
The analytical, consultative process through which 
Country Strategic Plans are developed will focus 
WFP™s efforts on its strengths, and thus enhance WFP™s added value, foster engagement with governments and enable partnerships to cohere 
around a common approach to eliminating hunger.
75. The Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021) provides 

the strategic direction for WFP but does 
not articulate WFP™s resourcing projections, 
funding and shortfalls. WFP is a voluntarily funded organization that relies entirely on contributions from governments, corporations Country Strategic Plans will be the vehicle for 
resource mobilization, fund management and 
spending authority, and for delivering on WFP™s 
commitment to guidelines and procedures 
regarding the allocation of multilateral 
contributions for development assistance. WFP 
recognizes that the implementation of policies for humanitarian and development coherence is supported by funding streams for both 
humanitarian and development activities, and 
available and forecasted resources will inform 
the country operational planning of activity 41implementation. Over the term of the Strategic 
past trends, including along the humanitarianŒ
developmentŒpeacebuilding nexus, and will 
comply with resource allocation decisions of the Board that recognize these patterns, including for 
multilateral resources. 76. A separate policy paper on Country Strategic 

Plans that expands on the principles and 
processes highlighted in the Strategic Plan 
(2017Œ2021) will be submitted to the Board for 
approval in November 2016.4277. WFP™s current performance management system 
is built on two performance frameworks: the 
Management Results Framework, which captures 

and the Strategic Results Framework, which 
frameworks and related results chains provide 
a complete picture of WFP™s performance. Use 
of the two frameworks has provided the basis 
for organization-wide planning, monitoring and 
reporting under the Strategic Plan (2008Œ2013) 
and the current Strategic Plan (2014Œ2017). 78. With the new Strategic Plan (2017Œ2021), WFP 
is seizing the opportunity to integrate strategic and management results into a single CRF. The 
CRF is built around two Strategic Goals drawn

and activity statements will be drafted at the 
country level in line with the CRF. Country-

statements linked to standardized categories Strategic Outcomes, outputs and activities at the country level while ensuring a harmonized approach to performance measurement and 
reporting across countries. The CRF will ensure 
harmonized design, monitoring and reporting 

the CRF will be a further step in aligning WFP™s 
monitoring and reporting on results with those of 

other United Nations agencies, particularly UNICEF,
 UNDP and the United Nations Population Fund.79. In line with international norms, the monitoring 

of SDG indicators and of selected national, 
subnational and thematic indicators will be 
the responsibility of national authorities with 
the assistance of international organizations.57 WFP™s performance management will involve 
tracking operational outcome indicators, process indicators, output indicators and activity indicators. Outcome and output achievement values will be reported on in annual performance reports at the country and global level. In 
addition, WFP™s evaluation function will provide 
independent assessment of WFP™s contributions 

and objectives, in line with the Evaluation Policy™s 

coverage norms, standards and principles.80. To support consistent monitoring of CRF 

indicators, WFP will update its normative 
framework for monitoring, including by revising 
the standard operating procedures for monitoring 
and the minimum monitoring requirements. 
All corporate guidance on monitoring will also 
be updated, and all logical frameworks will be 
realigned with the new Strategic Results and 
Strategic Objectives and will incorporate the new planning elements and indicators. WFP will also work towards establishing sustainable funding 
models for assessment and monitoring systems 
that enable it to better capture and report on 
results at the outcome level.57 United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) documents E/CN.32016/2 and E/CN.32016/3. 2016. Report of the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on

alignment of WFP activities with other United Nations agencies supporting the achievement of joint planning, joint performance and joint 
resource mobilization. 83. The CPB is a very different concept from the 

current use of multiple projects with their own 
start and end dates. The budget is based on a 
calendar year, and linked to SDG targets and results. As the CSPs will encompass all the planned
 outcomes that WFP will support in that country, 

the corresponding budget structure will provide clear links from corporate strategy to resourcing 
for WFP Strategic Outcomes, and it will enable 
WFP to plan its full portfolio of activities annually. 
The CPB will shift away from the current 
reliance on the inputs and cost components of

Strategic Results are:2. Target 2.1: By 2030 end hunger and ensure 

access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations including infants, 
3. SDG indicators 2.1:

Ł Food Insecurity Experience Scale.
4. Target 2.2: By 2030 end all forms of 
malnutrition, including achieving by 2025 the 
internationally agreed targets on stunting and 

and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women, and older persons.5. SDG indicators 2.2:
Ł prevalence of stunting (height for age <-2

World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth 
Standards) among children under 5 years of age; andŁ prevalence of malnutrition (weight for height 
>+2 or <-2 standard deviation from the median 
of the WHO Child Growth Standards) among 
children under 5, disaggregated by type (wasting

 http://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/47th-session/documents/2016-2-IAEG-SDGs-Rev1-E.pdf.
2 For SDG 2.1, WFP also considers the food consumption score (FCS) an important indicator. WFP calculates the FCS from the frequency of consumption of 

different food groups by a household during the seven days before the survey. This is an indicator of food access, based on both dietary diversity and the frequency of food groups consumed. The FCS is relevant to operations at the subnational level, which is why it is not included in the SDG indicator framework as a global indicator. However, the FCS is a proven WFP corporate indicator collected in more than 50 countries, with an operational history of more than 10 
years and has enabled the organization to assess and monitor food access and consumption in developing countries. Many institutions including the World Bank for its computation provides a rich data repository that may be employed in a variety of ways. For example, nutrient adequacy may be analysed from the raw 
or to prioritize dietary habits that are consistent with sustainable development goals. WFP will continue to support countries in using the FCS for monitoring food security and nutrition, particularly with respect to SDG 2.1, as appropriate, and it will continue to be a core operational indicator in the CRF.47ANNEX I11.

enough to eat. It is one of the global goals that 
world leaders have set for 2030. Achieving zero 
hunger means ending chronic hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, leaving no one behind, and humanity requires it so that people can reach their full potential.

and development assistance with the highest standards of corporate behaviour towards the people, communities and governments it serves, towards its 
partners, and towards the societies and the world.IDEALS OF THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER AND THE HUMANITARIAN PRINCIPLES 1. WFP is committed to working towards a world

 WFP is committed to adhering to the values, purposes
 and principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Promoting and encouraging respect for human 
rights and international humanitarian law is a core objective of the United Nations. Through its mandate to address hunger, WFP is committed to ensuring that it does not exacerbate or create risks to people through its presence or assistance, but rather seeks ways of fostering 
people™s safety, dignity and integrity. In doing 
so, WFP acknowledges the interlinkages between 
risks to people™s fundamental human rights and hunger and the potential of food assistance to support people™s safety and maintain their dignity. 
ACCOUNTABILITY TO AFFECTED POPULATIONS4. WFP is accountable to affected populations, 
both for achieving results in addressing hunger 
and for the manner in which programmes are 
implemented. This requirement calls for the systematic and meaningful engagement of people, including the most marginalized, in all 
stages of the project cycle, to ensure that people 
have a voice in the decisions that affect their 
lives. Basing programmes on feedback from 
affected communities helps to ensure that needs 

ultimately resulting in more effective programmes. 
UNITY OF PURPOSE, INTEGRITY, AND DEDICATION 5. WFP™s greatest strength is its dedicated women 
and men working around the world who provide 
access to nutritious food and promote lasting 

security threats and risks to personal safety are considerable. WFP™s dedicated individuals draw on an unparalleled range of expertise in 
providing nutritious foods, logistics, engineering, 
telecommunications, food security needs assessment, 

post-emergency rehabilitation and longer term 
capacity development, conducting operations 
with integrity and with respect for the many people, 
organizations and environments WFP touches.WORKING FOR WFP AND THE UNITED NATIONS6. WFP and its people are expected to abide by 
the core values of WFP and the United Nations 
Œ at all times be loyal to WFP and the United 
Nations with a shared vision of WFP and the 
United Nations, placing the interests of WFP and its mission above one™s own interests while respecting each other and others, regardless of differences in views and cultural practices. WFP is committed to respecting all persons equally, including people living with disabilities, the 

empowerment and gender equality. WORKING WITH OTHERS/COMMITMENT TO PARTNERSHIP PRINCIPLES 7. Achieving zero hunger requires WFP to act 
as a system player that is actively helping to 
shape the way in which partners interact and 
relate to WFP and each other by engaging in 
operational and knowledge partnerships with organizations offering complementary skills and resources that maximizes value for the people it serves. This requires long-term engagement with key partners Œ including governments, 
United Nations agencies, civil society, private 
business, international foundations and research 
institutions Œ to develop strong partnerships and 

demands and WFP™s strengths and expertise. 

WFP is committed to work with partners who have 
values similar to its own and work to the same standards. This means, while engaging with 
WFP, partners must respect the fundamental 
values, principles and standards of WFP and its 
personnel must act accordingly, respecting the 
dignity of the people and the communities it serves.

 |  1FOREWORDThe number of people battling acute hunger and suffering from 
malnutrition is on the rise yet again. In many places, we still lack the ability 
to collect reliable and timely data to truly know the magnitude and severity 
of food crises gripping vulnerable populations. And the upheaval that 
has been set in motion by the COVID-19 pandemic may push even more 
families and communities into deeper distress. 
At this time of immense global challenges, from conˇicts to climate shocks 
to economic instability, we must redouble our efforts to defeat  hunger and 
malnutrition. This is crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development 
Goals and building a more stable and resilient world.  
We have the tools and the know-how.  What we need is political will and 
sustained commitment by leaders and nations. This report should be seen 
as a call to action and I commend its contents to a wide global audience.António Guterres

 GRFC 2020 in briefThe Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) ˜˚˜˚ is the result of 
a joint, consensus-based assessment of acute food insecurity 
situations around the world by ˛˝ partner organizations.
 the number of people in Crisis or worse 
 (IPC/CH Phase ˘ or above) in ˜˚˛˝ was the highest in the four 
years of the GRFC's existence. This increase also reˇected the 
inclusion of additional countries and areas within some countries.
e in both the 
 ˜˚˛˝ and the ˜˚˜˚ reports, the population in Crisis or worse 
 (IPC/CH Phase ˘ or above) rose from ˛˛˜ to ˛˜˘ million. This 
reˇected worsening acute food insecurity in key conˇict-driven 
crises, notably the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South 
Sudan and the growing severity of drought and economic shocks 
as drivers in countries such as Haiti, Pakistan and Zimbabwe.

food-crisis countries analysed. These children have limited access 
to sufˆcient dietary energy, nutritionally diverse diets, clean 
drinking water, sanitation and health care, which weakens their 
health and nutrition status, with dire consequences for their 
development and long-term productivity. 
Drivers of acute food insecurity
Conˇict/insecurity was still the main driver of food crises in 
˜˚˛˝, but weather extremes and economic shocks became 
increasingly signiˆcant. Over half of
insecure people in countries where conˇict was identiˆed as the 
primary driver were in the Middle East and Asia. Regional crises 
continued to see high levels of acute food insecurity, particularly 
in the Lake Chad Basin and Central Sahel. 
Africa had the largest numbers of acutely food-insecure people in 
need of assistance in countries badly affected by weather events, 
particularly in the Horn of Africa and Southern Africa, followed by 
Central America and Pakistan. 
In East Africa, armed conˇicts, intercommunal violence and 
other localized tensions continued to affect peace and security, 
particularly in South Sudan, and continued to maintain large 
refugee populations in neighbouring countries, such as Uganda.
The report reˇects the growing inˇuence of economic crises 
on acute food insecurity levels, particularly in the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Haiti and the Sudan.
emained displaced globally 
as of them internally displaced and 
˜˚˙million were refugees under UNHCR™s mandate. More 
than half of these refugees were hosted in countries with high 
numbers of acutely food-insecure people. In countries where 
funding constraints have reduced assistance in refugee camps, 
refugees™ food security was severely threatened.
Short-term outlook for 2020 
The acute food insecurity forecasts for ˜˚˜˚ were produced 
before COVID-˛˝ became a pandemic and do not account for its 
likely impact in food crisis countries. 
The combined effects of conˇict, macroeconomic crisis, climate-
related shocks and crop pests, including fall armyworm and 
desert locusts, were likely to ensure that Yemen remained the 
world's worst food crisis. 
In East Africa, abundant seasonal rains beneˆtted crops and 
rangelands, but fostered a severe desert locust outbreak that 
will likely aggravate acute food insecurity in complex and fragile 
contexts.
Protracted conˇicts will either maintain or increase acute food 
insecurity levels in parts of Central Africa. In Southern Africa, 
post-harvest improvements are likely to be short-lived as poor 
2020The number of acutely malnourished 
children under 5 years across the 55 
countries/territories analysed in 201917Mrains, high food prices and unresolved political and economic 
instability could worsen acute food insecurity levels. Increasing 
violence, displacements and disrupted agriculture and trade in 
tandem with adverse climate in West Africa and Sahel countries 
will worsen acute food insecurity conditions in many areas.
Violent conˇict and currency depreciation will drive alarming 
rates of acute food insecurity and acute malnutrition levels across 
the most troubled areas of the Middle East and Asia.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, sociopolitical crises, weather 
extremes, lack of employment and high food prices are likely to 
lead to deteriorating acute food insecurity in some countries. 
The drivers of food crises, as well as lack of access to dietary 
energy and diversity, safe water, sanitation and health care 
will continue to create high levels of child malnutrition, while 
COVID-˛˝ is likely to overburden health systems. 
The pandemic may well devastate livelihoods and food security, 
especially in fragile contexts and particularly for the most 
vulnerable people working in the informal agricultural and non-
agricultural sectors. A global recession will majorly disrupt food 
supply chains. 
While all partners are in broad agreement with the data and information 
presented in this report, FEWS˙NET™s analyses suggest that the population 
requiring emergency food assistance in 2019 was lower than the IPC estimates 
for Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Haiti.

4  | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-˚˛) is having an 
unprecedented impact around the world, both in health 
and socioeconomic terms. By ˚˚ April, ˚.˝ million cases 
and nearly ˚˙˙ ˙˙˙ deaths had occurred globally (WHO, 
˚˚ April ˆ˙ˆ˙). 
While COVID-˛˝ does not discriminate, 
territories that are 
people in need of urgent humanitarian food and nutrition 
assistance are the most vulnerable to the consequences of this 
pandemic as they have very limited or no capacity to cope with 
either the health or socioeconomic aspects of the shock.
These countries may face an excruciating trade-off between 
saving lives or livelihoods or, in a worst-case scenario, saving 
people from the corona virus to have them die from hunger. To 
prevent these tens of millions of people already facing food crises 
from succumbing to the virus or to its economic consequences, 
all actors need to mobilize and coordinate along a set of 
operational and strategic priorities. 
In addition to the countries covered in the GRFC ˜˚˜˚, the 
pandemic may drive up acute food insecurity levels in other 
countries. For instance, Small Island Developing States (SIDS) 
and oil-exporting countries may be severely affected as they are 
net importers of food with populations that are dependent on 
income from remittances and tourism.
The impact on health and nutrition
In most of the countries covered in this report, national health 
systems are already over-stretched, with an alarming dearth of 
equipment, medicines and trained staff. 
Poor people, including displaced people, often lack sufˆcient 
economic resources to access health care and/or live in remote 
areas far from services. Some groups are fearful of being 
stigmatized or discriminated against in accessing public services. 
People in food crises often have higher rates of underlying 
health conditions, including non-communicable diseases and 
malnutrition (acute, chronic and micronutrient deˆciencies), 
which weaken the immune system and increase the risk of 
people developing severe COVID-˛˝ symptoms. 
Rising levels of food insecurity and lack of access to healthcare Œ 
either because of movement restrictions, strained health systems 
or falling incomes Œ are likely to increase malnutrition rates, 
particularly among children, pregnant and lactating women and 
the elderly. 
There are also urgent concerns for the nutritional status of 
children in families that rely on school feeding programmes to ˆll 
food gaps.The impact on food availability
On the food supply side, harvests have been good and the ˜˚˜˚ 
outlook for staple crops is promising. However, movement 
restrictions necessary to contain the spread of the virus will 
disrupt the transport and processing of food and other critical 
goods, increasing delivery times and reducing availability of 
even the most basic food items. For households dependent on 
food production and livestock rearing, any disruption in the 
supply chain of agricultural inputs or the inability to access 
livestock markets, will likely lead to declines in crop and livestock 
production and sales.
The food security consequences of the pandemic on nomadic 
and semi-nomadic pastoralists will likely be grave if national 
governments close borders, disrupting livestock migration routes, 
including across the fragile Sahel region. In countries where 
crop and livestock production are affected by the desert locust 
outbreak, the restrictions on movement may hinder locust control 
operations with dramatic consequences for crop production.
The impact on food access
Rising unemployment and under-employment is likely to 
severely reduce people™s purchasing power. Urban populations, 
particularly daily wage earners in the informal economies and 
service sector employees, are particularly at risk of losing their 
income sources as a result of regulations on social distancing and 
government restrictions to minimize transmission. 
Those who are reliant on remittances to meet their basic needs 
and those who cross borders on a regular basis to engage in 
livelihood activities will lose their income sources. As households 
face reduced purchasing power, there is great potential for a 
decline in consumer demand Œ particularly for higher value 
products Œ further weakening the income of producers, including 
those who produce high-value food products. 
Pandemic alert 
Mobilizing for the impact of 
COVID-19 in food-crisis countries
GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 
 |  5Movement restrictions (and illness) are likely to limit the 
availability of agricultural labour, which will contribute to 
rising food prices. Protectionism policies, such as tariffs and 
export bans, could also drive up food prices, while food crisis 
countries that rely heavily on food imports to cover consumption 
requirements, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
the Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen, will experience 
rising food prices if their currencies depreciate further relative to 
the US dollar. If major importers resort to panic buying, the price 
of globally traded food commodities could increase, particularly 
in the short term. Whether or not localized food price spikes will 
trickle down to remote rural markets will depend on the level 
of integration of local markets, as well as other factors such as 
harvest performance, seasonality, infrastructure and security.
Simulations developed by the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) indicated that the expected 
˜˚˜˚ GDP growth of ˜.˝ percent (forecast in November ˜˚˛˝) 
could be downgrcent if the disease spreads widely 
across Asia-Paciˆc, Europe and North America. 
Growing fear in global markets could result in a severe decline in 
international ˆnancing and portfolio outˇows from food-insecure 
countries. As these countries often have limited ˆscal and 
external buffers, this trend would pose a signiˆcant risk to their 
governments™ ability to ˆght the pandemic and maintain existing 
support to vulnerable households.  
The impact on displaced populations
Displaced people living in camps and displaced/host populations 
in urban areas are particularly vulnerable in overcrowded settings 
with poor access to adequate health care, lack of clean water, 
hand-washing facilities and sanitation, where social distancing 
is difˆcult, if not impossible. The legal status of refugees often 
prevents them from being included in national social protection 
support, putting them at serious risk of rising poverty levels 
given their severely limited ability to access income. Restrictions 
on border crossings may prevent asylum seekers from realizing 
their right for protection and assistance. 
Social tensions and conˇictCOVID-˛˝ could create the conditions for social and political 
unrest, especially in the most vulnerable food-crisis countries. 
Uncertainty of future impacts of the pandemic combined with 
restrictions on movement, soaring unemployment, limited 
access to food, and the erosion of already fragile livelihoods may 
generate discontent, fueling violence and conˇict. 
A lack of food/goods in refugee camps may increase tension 
among refugees and host communities. Perceptions that the 
virus is brought by non-nationals may escalate discrimination 
and social exclusion, particularly in areas hosting displaced 
populations.Any postponement of elections may jeopardize the democratic 
process and generate tensions between ruling parties and 
oppositions. The disease could hinder international mediation 
efforts for conˇict resolution, as well as peacekeeping operations. 
Violence and exploitation, including sexual exploitation and 
abuse and intimate partner violence, are likely to increase during 
epidemic outbreaks due to increased conˆnement and exposure 
to perpetrators, increased stress, and reduced income and access 
to basic needs. Many children who are no longer attending 
school during the day face increased protection risks at home.
Impacts on humanitarian assistance
A major compounding factor for food-crisis countries is that 
the pandemic is likely to have signiˆcant repercussions on the 
delivery of humanitarian assistance. Resources may be diverted 
to support COVID-˛˝ efforts, affecting budgets for assistance. 
Movement restrictions are likely to affect the mobility of 
supplies and staff including the ability to conduct ˆeld work. 
Humanitarian delivery costs may increase as a result.  
Pre-empting the socioeconomic impacts 
 of COVID-19: priorities for action
Given the unprecedented nature of the crisis, creating a better 
understanding of the potential impacts of COVID-˛˝ and taking 
rapid collective action to pre-empt its impact on food security and 
food systems are of paramount importance and urgency.  
Anticipatory actions must be undertaken now to safeguard the 
livelihoods of the most vulnerable people and related agri-
food systems to protect the critical food supply chain. Such 
interventions must comply with government measures and 
health guidelines and should be designed and implemented 
in partnership and close coordination between governments, 
humanitarian and development actors.Expand near-real time, remote food security monitoring 
systems to provide up-to-date information on the impacts of 
the outbreak on food security and livelihoods, health, access 
to services, markets and supply chains, among others, for early 
action and mitigation.Preserve critical humanitarian food, livelihood and nutrition 
assistance to vulnerable groups
 Œ adapted to potential 
COVID-˛˝ impacts Œ to ensure that needs are fully met. 
Position food in food-crisis countries to reinforce and scale 
up social protection systems,
 ensuring the most vulnerable 
who are affected or at high risk of COVID-˛˝ can still access food. 
Scale up support for food processing, transport and local 
food markets, and advocate for trade corridors to remain 
open to ensure the continuous functioning of the critical food 
supply chain and agri-food systems in food-crisis countries.6  | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020
According to an analysis of external ˆnancial ˇows for

As ˆgure ˜ shows, deep inequalities exist between recipient

ˆve times more humanitarian assistance than the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo and seven times more than Afghanistan. 
However, some of these inequalities may be the result of higher 
costs of response in certain contexts due to relatively poorer 
infrastructures and restricted access to populations in need, for 
instance.Similarly, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the 
Sudan e

Arab Republic received almost four times more assistance than 
the Sudan. 
Although e people in 
need of urgent food, nutrition and livelihoods assistance 
than South Sudan, the latter received about three times more 
humanitarian assistance than Afghanistan. However, these 
signiˆcant differences in external assistance provided between 
countries must again be considered in the light of the variety of 
contexts and the various levels of domestic response provided by 
governments to food crisis situations (i.e. domestic response is 
not considered in the analysis presented here). 
Looking at investment in development, the analysis revealed 
that the ˘˜ countries/territories with major food crises received 
signiˆcant development as 
security, agriculture ˘). 
This represented rcent of the total ODA (ofˆcial 
development assistance) for these three sectors to food-crisis 
. 
Overall, ar 
sistance in food-related 
. In many countries, 
especially those affected by protracted conˇict, the spending on 
humanitarian assistance far outweighed that on development 
assistance (ˆgur 
For instance, 
million in humanitarian assistance and less than USD ˜˚˚ million 
for development. 
In Yemen,, humanitarian assistance reached more 
than USD ˛ billion, while less than USD ˛˚˚ million was provided 
for development assistance. Some countries had more balanced 
spending on the humanitarian and development assistance. The 
Democratic Republic of the Congo received comparable levels 
of humanitarian and development assistance, though both were 
limited. Ethiopia represents another case where the assistance is

WHY THIS REPORT?
Reliable data and analysis are important tools in 
tackling the root causes of food crises
The Global Report on Food Crises
 is the result of a joint 
assessment of acute food insecurity situations around the 
 
By carrying out collective analysis and providing clear, 
independent evidence the partners aim to guide coherent 
and coordinated strategic humanitarian and development 
investments. The report tracks the numbers and locations 
of people most in need of emergency food, nutrition 
and livelihood assistance and it captures how acute food 
 Chapter 1Introduction and methods
insecurity and malnutrition conditions have changed over 
time. It identiˆes the main drivers of acute food insecurity 
and malnutrition Œ and explores whether and how conˇict, 
weather extremes and economic shocks interact and 
exacerbate food crisis situations. It also examines how 
chronic, structural or seasonal issues combine with shocks to 
exacerbate situations. 
The data and evidence presented here can inform cost-
efˆcient and needs-based humanitarian and resilience-
building actions, and ultimately enable agencies to seek 
high-level political action and coordinate policies and actions 
for durable and innovative ways to tackle the root causes of 
food crises. In concrete terms, agencies, governments and 
The Global Network Against Food Crises was co-founded 
by the European Union, FAO and WFP at the 2016 World 
Humanitarian Summit (WHS) in response to the call for 
new approaches to tackle protracted crises and recurrent 
disasters, reduce vulnerability and better manage risks by 
bridging the divide between development, humanitarian 
and conˇict-preventing action. The latter is often referred to 
as the humanitarianŒdevelopmentŒpeace (HDP) nexus.
The Global Network brings together partners from across 
the spectrum of interventions to tackle food crises, 
incorporating humanitarian and development actions and 
linking to other sectors, such as education, health, the 
environment and peace. It aims to develop evidence-based 
approaches, build capacities and provide knowledge to 
more effectively prevent, prepare for and respond to food 
crises, ultimately contributing to longer-term recovery, 
development and resilience-building efforts.
The Global Network addresses the multiple facets of food 
crises that cannot be successfully tackled by individual 
actors working under their own speci˘c mandates. It 
facilitates a fundamental change in the way international and local actors interact and promotes a holistic approach 
to address food crises worldwide. Partners in the Global 
Network work together and achieve results at national, 
regional and global level in three key areas:
Ł  Evidence-based analyses of food crisis risks and of 
people™s resilience to various shocks; knowledge 
management and communication monitoring, 
evaluation and learning.
Ł  Strategic investments for addressing and preventing 
food crises. 
Ł  Synergies and coordination with other sectors to address 
the full spectrum of humanitarian, development and 
peace-building needs. This aims to deliver a more 
inclusive, equitable, resilient and sustainable set of 
context-speci˘c responses and solutions.
Within the Global Network™s framework and approach, 
the Food Security Information Network (FSIN) facilitates 
the consensus-building process around food security 
and nutrition analyses, and ensures a constant ˇow of 
information and exchange between stakeholders at 
country, regional and global level around food security and 
nutrition analysis.GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 
 |  11other key stakeholders can use the information to bolster the 
case for changing food systems, building resilience to extreme 
weather events, resolving conˇict, promoting durable peace 
and upholding international humanitarian law. 
This report is the ˇagship publication of a series of analytical 
products facilitated by the Food Security Information Network 
(FSIN) and produced under the initiative of the Global 
Network Against Food Crises.
The humanitarian-development-peace (HDP) nexus has 
emerged as a major focus of policy debate in the years since 
the United Nations Secretary General™eport for the 
World Humanitarian Summit. The Commitment to Action 
signed at the WHS called on humanitarian, development and 
other relevant actors to work collaboratively towards collective 
outcomes that reduce needs, risks and vulnerabilities over 
multiple years through a ﬁNew Way of Workingﬂ. 
Funding and ˆnancing tools, instruments, policies and 
approaches have not had time to adapt to the new HDP 
policy agenda proposed at the WHS. Moreover, practical 
challenges in the operationalization of the humanitarian and 
development collaboration in links with peace are emerging. 
In particular, stakeholders at country level report lack of 
clarity regarding roles and rules of engagement, as well as 
signiˆcant divergences in principles and practices, limiting the 
convergence between actors along the nexus. 
The Global Network Against Food Crises is an attempt to foster 
greater collaboration and cohesive action along the nexus.
WHAT IS FOOD INSECURITY? 
Food insecurity refers to the lack of secure access to sufˆcient 
amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal human growth 
and development and an active and healthy life. For people 
to be food secure, food must be both 
consistently available and accessible
 in sufˆcient quantities and diversity and 
households must be able to utilize (store, cook, prepare and 
share) the food in a way that has a positive nutritional impact.
Acute food insecurity 
Acute food insecurity is any manifestation of food insecurity 
at a speciˆc point in time of a severity that threatens lives, 
livelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or 
duration. These acute states are highly susceptible to 
change and can manifest in a population within a short 
amount of time, as a result of sudden changes or shocks that 
negatively impact on the determinants of food insecurity 
and malnutrition (IPC, ˜˚˛˝). Transitory food insecurity is a 
short-term or temporary inability to meet food consumption 
requirements related to sporadic crises, indicating a capacity 
to recover.
Chronic food insecurity 
Chronic food Insecurity is a long-term or persistent inability 
to meet dietary energy requirements (lasting for a signiˆcant 
period of time during the year), FAO deˆnes this as 
'undernourishment' and it is the basis for the SDG indicator 
˜.˛.˛ published in SOFI.
People experiencing moderate food insecurity face 
uncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have been 
forced to reduce, at times during the year, the quality and/or 
quantity of food they consume due to lack of money or other 
resources. It thus refers to a lack of consistent access to food, 
which diminishes dietary quality, disrupts normal eating 
patterns, and can have negative consequences for nutrition, 
health and well-being. People facing severe food insecurity, 
on the other hand, have likely run out of food, experienced 
hunger and, at the most extreme, gone for days without 
eating, putting their health and well-being at grave risk (FAO 
et al., ˜˚˛˝).
e 
undernourished; [–] more 
exposed to severe levels of food insecurity' and 'an additional 
˛.˘ billion people, have experienced food insecurity at 
moderate levels' (
The State of Food Security and Nutrition in 
the World ˜˚˛˝
).Drivers of acute food insecurity
The drivers of acute food insecurity are often interlinked 
and mutually reinforcing, making it difˆcult to pinpoint the 
speciˆc trigger or driver of each food crisis. The GRFC ˜˚˜˚ 
takes a practical approach by estimating which are the most 
salient for each country/territory out of the broad categories  
explained below.
Conˇict/insecurity 
This includes interstate conˇicts, internal violence, regional 
 or global instability, civil unrest or political crises leading to 
displacements.In conˇict civilians are frequently deprived of their income 
sources and pushed into acute food insecurity. Food systems 
and markets are disrupted, pushing up food prices and 
sometimes leading to scarcities of water and fuel, or of food 
itself. Landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised 
explosive devices often destroy agricultural land, mills, 
storage facilities, machinery etc. 
Conˇict prevents businesses from operating and weakens 
the national economy, reducing employment opportunities, 
increasing poverty levels and diverting government spending 
towards the war effort. Health systems are usually damaged 
or destroyed leaving people reliant on humanitarian 
support Œ yet increasingly insecurity and roadblocks prevent 
humanitarian convoys from reaching the most vulnerable. Or 
12  | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020
aid agencies face lengthy delays, restrictions on personnel 
or the type or quantity of aid supplies, or insufˆcient security 
guarantees. Parties to conˇict can deny people access to 
food as a weapon of war, especially in areas under blockade/
embargo. Food insecurity itself can become a trigger for 
violence and instability, particularly in contexts marked by 
pervasive inequalities and fragile institutions. Sudden spikes 
in food prices tend to exacerbate the risk of political unrest 
and conˇict (FAO et al., 
Weather extremes
These include droughts, ˇoods and the untimely start of rainy 
seasons.
Weather-related events can directly affect crops and/or 
livestock, cut off roads and prevent markets from being 
stocked. Poor harvests push up food prices and diminish 
agricultural employment opportunities, lowering income at 
a time when households are more market-reliant because of 
reduced food stocks. 
Adverse weather events are particularly grave for smallholder 
farmers who cannot afford to invest in the systems and inputs 
required to withstand and recover from the impacts of such 
shocks, and for pastoralists who are vulnerable because they 
rely on rain-fed rangeland for grazing livestock and have very 
few ˆxed assets. 
People™s vulnerability to weather shock events rests on their 
capacity to adapt, the scale and frequency of shocks and their 
dependence on the affected sector. Repeated events further 
erode capacity to withstand future shocks. Weather events 
and changes in climate can often lead to an intensiˆcation of 
conˇict between pastoralist herders and farmers over access 
to water and grazing. There is ample evidence suggesting 
that natural disasters Œ particularly droughts Œ contribute to 
aggravating existing civil conˇicts.  
Economic shocks
Economic shocks can affect the food insecurity of households 
or individuals through various channels. Macroeconomic 
shocks, characterized by high inˇation or hyperinˇation, 
signiˆcant currency depreciation, worsening terms of trade, 
high unemployment rates and loss of income, a signiˆcant 
contraction in exports and a critical decrease in investments 
and other capital inˇows tend to coincide with increases in 
acute food insecurity. Increases in prices of staple grains, oil or 
agricultural inputs can affect food availability, food prices and 
incomes. Microeconomic shocks are characterized by rising 
food prices, lack of income sources and consequent reduction 
in purchasing power, which directly affect households' food 
security.
Countries with weak governance and institutions, or facing 
armed conˇict, civil unrest or instability, are particularly 
vulnerable to the impact of economic decline. High debt 
constrains economic growth, increases vulnerability to 
economic shocks and detracts from development spending. 
Other driversOther drivers are used in the GRFC but are not recorded as the 
primary driver in any of the countries analysed.
Health shocks
  Disease outbreaks (occurrence of disease 
cases in excess of normal expectancy) are usually caused by 
an infection, transmitted through person-to-person contact, 
animal-to-person contact, or from the environment or other 
media. Water, sanitation, food and air quality are vital 
elements in the transmission of communicable diseases and 
in the spread of diseases prone to cause epidemics. Displaced 
populations Œ particularly in overcrowded camps Œ are more 
susceptible to disease outbreaks which strained health 
systems cannot prevent or control (WHO). 
Epidemics and pandemics can also affect the ability of people 
to carry on their activities and livelihoods and, in the worst 
cases when widespread, may also affect markets and supply 
chains.   
Crop pests and animal diseases 
 Fall armyworms, desert 
locusts, etc can damage crops and may lead to severe 
production shortfalls. Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), foot-
and-mouth disease (FMD), or Rift Valley fever (RVF) often affect 
livestock and pastoralists' livelihoods in food-crisis contexts.
Natural disasters (non-weather related)
  Disasters such 
as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions can lead to 
major property, infrastructure and/or environmental damage 
as well as loss of human life.
DisplacementDisplacement is often a side-effect of conˇict, food insecurity 
and weather shocks. Displaced people are often more 
vulnerable to food insecurity and malnutrition having had 
to abandon their livelihoods and assets, undertake arduous 
journeys and settle in areas or camps with limited access to 
basic services or former social networks. Their rights are often 
restricted due to host country legal frameworks, resulting in a 
lack of access to land, employment and freedom of movement. 
They are often dependent on humanitarian assistance to meet 
their food needs. 
Forced displacement is the movement of people who have 
been obliged to leave their homes, particularly to avoid the 
effects of armed conˇict, generalized violence, violations of 
human rights or natural or human-made disasters.
A refugee is someone who has been forced to ˇee his or her 
country because of persecution, war or violence. Refugees are 
recognized under various international agreements. Some 
are recognized as a group or on a ‚prima facie™ basis while 
others undergo an individual investigation before being 
GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020

Relating to the Status of Refugees provide the full legal 
deˆnition of a refugee. 
An asylum-seeker is a person seeking sanctuary in a country 
other than their own and waiting for a decision about their 
status. The legal processes related to asylum are complex 
and variable, which is a challenge when it comes to 
counting, measuring and understanding the asylum-seeking 
population. When an asylum application is successful, the 
person is awarded refugee status.
Internally displaced people (IDPs) are those forced to ˇee 
their homes as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of 
armed conˇict, situations of generalized violence, violations of 
human rights, or natural or human-made disasters, and who 
have not crossed an international border. 
A stateless person is someone who does not have a nationality 
of any country. Some people are born stateless, but others 
become stateless due to a variety of reasons, including 
sovereign, legal, technical or administrative decisions or 
oversights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
underlines that 'Everyone has the right to a nationality'

 Sources for the ˆ˙ˆ˙ forecasts
The sources for the outlook and projected trends for ˜˚˜˚ 
vary. IPC/CH projections are estimated by outlining the main 
assumptions driving the evolution of food security in the 
projected period. The focus is on the 'most likely scenario' 
which helps to devise the potential changes on population 
distribution across IPC/CH phases. Also, it takes into account 
the potential effects of planned, funded and likely-to-occur 
humanitarian assistance in the area of analysis.
 FEWS NET food assistance outlook briefs provide information 
on the projected severity and magnitude of acute food 
insecurity (using ranges) and indicate each country™s food-
insecure population in need of urgent humanitarian food 
assistance (IPC Phase ˘ or above). FEWS NET projections are

1  None/Minimal Households are able to meet essential food and non-food needs without engaging 
  in atypical and unsustainable strategies to access food and income.
2  Stressed
 Households have minimally adequate food consumption but are unable to
 afford 
  some essential non-food expenditures without engaging in stress-coping
 strategies.
3  Crisis Households either: Ł  Have food consumption gaps that are reˇected by high or above-usual acute malnutrition; 
OR Ł  Are marginally able to meet minimum food needs but only by depleting essential livelihood 
       assets or through crisis-coping strategies.
4  Emergency
 Households either:  Ł  Have large food consumption gaps which are reˇected in very high acute malnutrition and 
       excess mortality; 
OR  Ł  Are able to mitigate large food consumption gaps but only by employing emergency livelihood 
       strategies and asset liquidation.
5  Catastrophe/Famine
  Households have an extreme lack of food and/or other basic needs even after full employment of 
  coping strategies. Starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels are 
  evident. (For Famine classiˆcation, area needs to have extreme critical levels of acute malnutrition

 |  15WHAT IS MALNUTRITION?
Malnutrition exists in different forms; it includes 
undernutrition and overnutrition. Undernutrition is more 
than a lack of food Œ it is a combination of factors: insufˆcient 
energy, protein and micronutrients exacerbated by frequent 
infections or disease. Malnutrition stunts children™s growth, 
deprives them of essential vitamins and minerals, and makes 
them more susceptible to frequent and severe disease and 
infections (UNICEF). 
There are also other forms of malnutrition. While not a focus of 
this report, it may also refer to overnutrition leading to obesity. 
This form of malnutrition is on the rise in almost every country 
in the world. Undernutrition and overnutrition frequently 
coexist within the same country, community, and even within 
the same individual. Stunted children, for example, face a 
greater risk of becoming overweight as adults (UNICEF).
Acute malnutritionA child being too thin for his or her height as a result of rapid 
weight loss or the failure to gain weight is a sign of acute 
malnutrition (wasting) which, although treatable, can lead 
to illness, disability or death. Moderate acute malnutrition 
(MAM) using the weight for height indicator is identiˆed by 
weight for height z scores (WHZ) below -˜ and above -˘ of the 
reference population, and severe acute malnutrition (SAM) 
by WHZ below -˘. Global acute malnutrition (GAM) reˇects 
both MAM and SAM in a population. Acute malnutrition can 
also be deˆned by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) 
measur with severe acute malnutrition 
deˆned with a measurement of   Children affected 
require urgent feeding, treatment and care to survive. Acute 
malnutrition rates depict the nutrition situation in the general 
population at a speciˆc time: they can show marked seasonal 
patterns and can change quickly over time. See table ˜.
Chronic malnutrition
A child being too short for his or her age (stunting) is considered 
chronically malnourished. This condition is preventable from 
the ˛˙˚˚˚ days between a woman™s pregnancy and the time her 
child turns two. The physical and cognitive damage caused by 
stunting can be irreversible and has far-reaching consequences, 
from diminished learning and school performance to lower 
future earnings, and can affect the next generation. Stunted 
childrars old are identiˆed by a height for age 
z score (HAZ) below -˜ of the reference population. Severe 
stunting is deˆned as HAZ below -˘. See table ˘.
Micronutrient de˘ciencies
Deˆciencies of vitamin A, iron and zinc are often referred to as 
‚hidden' hunger because it develops gradually over time, and 
a large percentage of the population may be deˆcient without 
showing any clinical symptoms or signs of deˆciency.
Drivers of malnutrition in food crises 
The immediate cause of acute malnutrition is a severe 
nutritional restriction either as a result of inadequate food 
intake, or a recent bout of illness, such as diarrhoea, that 
hinders appropriate intake and absorption of nutrients. The 
determinants of malnutrition also include inadequate access 
to healthcare, water and sanitation services, inappropriate 
child feeding and care practices, as described in the UNICEF 
framework .
Children require an adequate amount of nutrient dense 
foods for their optimum growth and development, to build 
immunity to infections and protect against disease. Exclusive 
breastfeeding in the ˆrst six months of life followed by 
the timely introduction of safe and nutritionally adequate 
complementary foods with continued breastfeeding until 
˜ years of age or beyond, ensures children receive all the 
nutrients they need. Pregnant and lactating women also need 
to consume foods from a variety of food groups, with adequate 
and appropriate nutrients and energy to meet the increased 
physiological requirements, to sustain healthy fetal growth 
and development, and support lactation. 
During humanitarian crises, access to nutritious foods may 
be limited by food shortages or disrupted food systems

    compromising the availability of adequate and safe 
complementary foods for vulnerable children. When food 
production is limited, and/or markets and infrastructure are 
functioning poorly the cost of food increases and vulnerable 
households with limited purchasing power struggle to provide 
children with the nutritious diet they require.
In addition, caregivers during emergencies may have reduced 
time to prepare nutritious meals and care for children because 
they may, for instance, have to take on additional agricultural 
tasks, care for other vulnerable family members or take longer 
to access services and water. In some contexts Œ such as during 
displacements Œ the precarious living conditions may also 
hinder the hygienic preparation of meals. 
Displaced populations often face severely compromised access 
to safe water and improved sanitation and are at increased risk 
of frequent outbreaks of infectious disease, which weakened 
health systems cannot treat, prevent or control. Measles, 
cholera, Ebola and dengue fever outbreaks are illnesses that 
have a negative impact on the overall health and nutritional 
status of individuals, especially young children. In crises 
children are often not able to access other preventive services 
such as micronutrient supplementation and immunization, 
further increasing the risk of malnutrition. Displacement 
can also result in the break-down of familial and community 
networks that provide the necessary support and guidance 
needed for looking after young children. 
Nutrition data sources for the GRFC 2020
The nutrition analysis was conducted only for countries facing 
a food crisis to complement the acute food insecurity analysis. 
The nutritional status of children and related contributing 
factors was assessed using globally agreed indicators and 
standards.
The GRFC reviews and analyses most recent available country 
data on anthropometry, dietary intake, infant and young 
child feeding (IYCF) practices, health and WASH indicators 
from national and sub-national nutrition surveys. These 
include representative SMART (Standardized Monitoring and 
Assessment for Relief and Transitions) surveys, Demographic 
and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicators Cluster Surveys 
(MICS), National Vulnerability Assessments and Analysis, and 
Infant and Young Child Feeding Œ Knowledge Attitude and 
Practices Assessments (IYCF KAP). For refugee populations 
nutrition data comes from UNHCR Standardized Expanded 
Nutrition Surveys (SENS).The GRFC uses the Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates ˜˚˛˝ 
(UNICEF, WHO, WB) for the number of children affected by 
stunting and acute malnutrition globally. In chapter˙˘, it uses 
in-country calculations approved by the nutrition clusters/
sectors and shared in key planning documents such as 
HNOs and Humanitarian Response Plans (HRP) including 
projections. For the drivers, it consults the above surveys and 
WHO, UNICEF, OCHA, ACAPS, UNHCR and other sources.
In ˜˚˛˝, ˛˚ countries (Chad, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, 
the Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uganda, Somalia and South 
Sudan) conducted an IPC acute malnutrition analysis in areas 
known to have high rates of acute malnutrition. The results of 
these analyses are shared in this report.
The IPC analysis process reviews all contributing factors 
affecting acute malnutrition in the area of analysis and 
classiˆes the severity of a nutrition situation in a population, 
using deˆned indicators.. The level of 
Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) is used to classify the 
severity of acute malnutrition and key factors such as dietary 
intake, disease, feeding and care practices, health and WASH 
environment and contextual information such as access to 
services, mortality etc are all included in the analysis. 
Priority response objectives
GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 
 |  17Minimum dietary diversity  for children aged 6Œ23 months 
This indicator refers to the percentage of children aged 
6Œ23 months who receive foods from more than ˘ve out 
of eight food groups a day. The eight food groups are: 
 i. breastmilk; ii. grains, roots and tubers; iii. legumes 
and nuts; iv. dairy products (infant formula, milk, 
yogurt, cheese); v. ˇesh foods (meat, ˘sh, poultry and 
liver/organ meats); vi. eggs; vii. vitamin-A rich fruits and 
vegetables; viii. other fruits and vegetables.
In some surveys minimum dietary diversity is calculated 
based on seven food groups, excluding breastmilk. In 
these cases, the indicator refers to the percentage of 
children aged 6Œ23 months who receive foods from 
more than four out of seven food groups a day.  
Minimum meal frequency
The indicator refers to the proportion of breastfed and 
non-breastfed children aged 6Œ23 months who receive 
solid, semi-solid or soft foods at least the minimum 
number of recommended times a day.  
Minimum acceptable diet  This composite indicator combines meal frequency and 
dietary diversity to assess the proportion of children 
aged 6Œ23 months consuming a diet that meets the minimum requirements for growth and development.
Percentage of households not consuming 
micronutrient-rich food (analysed in refugee 
populations)
This refers to the proportion of households with no 
member consuming any vegetables, fruits, meat, eggs, 
˘sh/seafood, and milk/milk products over a reference 
period of 24 hours. The food group of vegetables, fruits, 
meat, eggs, ˘sh/seafood, and milk/milk products are the 
same as the 12 food groups de˘ned by FAO (2011). 
Exclusive breastfeeding
 This indicator refers to the percentage of infants fed 
exclusively with breast milk up to six months of age, as 
recommended by WHO. 
  Prevalence of anaemia
 This indicator refers to the proportion of children aged 
6Œ59 months and of reproductive age women (15Œ49 
years) who are anaemic. 
Anaemia is a condition in which the number of 
red blood cells or their oxygen-carrying capacity is 
insuf˘cient to meet physiological needs, which varies 
by age, sex, altitude, smoking and pregnancy status. 
Iron de˘ciency is thought to be the most common 
cause of anaemia globally, although other conditions, 
such as folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin A de˘ciencies, 
chronic inˇammation, parasitic infections and inherited 
disorders can all cause anaemia. In its severe form, 
it is associated with fatigue, weakness, dizziness 
and drowsiness. Pregnant women and children are 
particularly vulnerable (WHO).   
 Access to basic drinking 
 water services 
 Improved drinking water sources are those which, 
by nature of their design and construction, have the 
potential to deliver safe water. The WHO and UNICEF 
Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply Sanitation 
and Hygiene (JMP) subdivides the population using 
improved sources into three groups (safely managed, 
basic and limited) according to the level of service 
provided. In order to meet the criteria for a safely 
managed drinking water service, people must use an 
improved source meeting three criteria: accessible 
on premises; available when needed; free from 
contamination.If the improved source does not meet any one of 
these criteria but a round trip to collect water takes 30 
minutes or less, then it is classi˘ed as a basic drinking 
water service. If water collection from an improved 
source exceeds 30 minutes, it is categorized as a limited 
service (WHO and UNICEF). 
For refugees, the indicator refers to the type of drinking 
water source used by the household and serves to 
indicate whether their drinking water is of a suitable 
quality or not.Additional nutrition indicators used in GRFC 2020

LIMITATIONS
Consensus
All partners are in agreement with the approximate degree 
of magnitude and severity of acute food insecurity indicated 
for the countries included in this report, except in the cases of 
Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti and 
Ethiopia, for which FEWS NET™s analyses of available evidence 
suggest that the population requiring emergency food 
assistance in ˜˚˛˝ was lower than the estimates based on the 
IPC. The differences stem from varying interpretations of the 
data related to factors contributing to acute food insecurity. 
Data gaps and challengesOmission of ˛˝ countries because of insuf˘cient evidence 
to produce estimates of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/
CH Phase ˙ or above, or equivalent) 
 Bolivia (Plurinational 
State of), Comoros, Congo, Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea, Djibouti, Syrian refugees in Egypt and Jordan, Eritrea, 
Iran (Islamic Republic of), Kyrgyzstan, Lao People's Democratic 
Republic, Nepal, Venezuelan migrants in Peru, Philippines 
and Tajikistan and displaced populations in Algeria/Western 
Sahara.  
Underestimation of numbers of people in Crisis or 
worse (IPC/CH Phase ˙ or above, or equivalent) for many 
countries  Data collection is not always national, and may only 
take place in accessible areas or those affected by a localized 
shock. Data collection might also have been conducted out of 
the peak season or the analysis did not include a projection 
for the timing of peak needs. In addition, the number of 
people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase ˘ or above) does 
not necessarily reˇect the full population in need of urgent 
action to decrease food gaps and protect and save lives 
and livelihoods. This is because some households may only 
be classiˆed in IPC/CH Phase ˛ or ˜ because they receive 
assistance, and are in fact in need of continued action. The 
number in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase ˘ or above) refers to 
populations in need of action further to that already taken.
Absence of estimates for populations in Stressed (IPC/CH 
Phase ˜) pending data sources 
 Bangladesh, Burundi, Iraq, 
Libya, Nicaragua, Rwanda, Uganda and Ukraine. This is mainly 
the case when using FEWS NET, HNOs or to a lesser extent 
WFP analyses as the source.
Lack of data availability and comparability for refugee 
food security  Refugee food security is measured in 
various ways across refugee populations and data are not 
systematically collected, disaggregated, consolidated or 
shared. Detailed, comparative analysis on refugee food 
security at country, regional or global level is not possible 
with current systems and processes, and particularly not in a 
comparable way to IPC/CH protocols.
Limited availability and frequency of national nutrition 
surveys and/or IPC acute malnutrition analyses  Only 
˛˚ countries Œ Chad, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, the 
Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda Œ 
conducted an IPC acute malnutrition analysis in ˜˚˛˝.  
Limited predictive analysis (acute food insecurity and 
malnutrition)  For several countries with no IPC/CH or 
compatible products where alternative estimates are used, 
predictive analyses are not available. In some cases where 
IPC/CH is used, data collection and analysis updates are not 
as frequent as might be needed to provide estimates for the 
forecast section of this report. IPC-compatible analyses offer 
range values for forecasts rather than precise estimates. Not 
all countries with a ˜˚˛˝ IPC acute malnutrition analysis had a 
projection beyond publication of the GRFC ˜˚˜˚. 
Comparability challenges
Most IPC results presented in this report are based on the 
IPC Technical Manual Version ˘.˚, which was launched in 
April ˜˚˛˝ and CH Technical Manual Version ˜.˚ for analyses 
carried out in OctoberŒNovember ˜˚˛˝. The use of these 
revised protocols does not affect the comparability of numbers 
of food-insecure people with previous analysis periods and 
between countries.For some countries, the coverage of food security analyses 
within and between years varies in terms of population (e.g. 
rural only vs. rural and urban) and/or areas analysed (e.g. part 
of the country vs. whole country). This affects the comparability 
of the number of acutely food-insecure people between 
time periods. In a few countries (e.g. Bangladesh, Burundi, 
Djibouti), no IPC acute food insecurity analysis was conducted 
in ˜˚˛˝. Depending on whether other comparable sources of 
information could be found, this hampers comparability with 
previous years and highlights the importance for food-crisis 
countries to conduct an IPC analysis at least once a year.

GRFC 2020. It provides the main list of 55 countries and territories in food crises, 
supplying the peak number of acutely food-insecure people in 2019.
Refer to the rest of the chapter for regional overviews of 2019 food crises for which 
data was available: three regions of Africa; Asia and the Middle East; Latin America 
and the Caribbean.
Chapter 3  covers the 35 most serious food crises in alphabetical order from 
Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. There is a graphical overview page for each country 
crisis providing the key relevant food security and nutrition data; a summary of 
the main drivers in order of their contribution to the country™s food crisis and the 
displacement ˘gures that are most relevant for the country/territory. 
The rest of each country pro˘le provides a more granular analysis of the acute food 
insecurity and nutrition situation in 2019 and discusses the drivers in some depth. 
Each pro˘le is illustrated with maps that give a sense of severity by region and, 
where possible, graphs that convey changes over time.
Chapter 4  provides a table with pre-COVID-19 pandemic estimates of the number 
of acutely food-insecure people in need of urgent action in 2020. 
It further provides an analysis of expected trends by country/territory in 2020. It 
explains the assumptions underlying the acute food insecurity forecasts for 2020. 
Regional maps of Africa, Asia and Latin America/Caribbean indicate the projected 
ranges of the numbers of people in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above as well as primary 
drivers and risks by country.
How to use this report
URGENT CALL TO ACTION TO 
IMPROVE DATA ANALYTICS
If governments, humanitarian actors and development 
agencies are to prevent food crises from getting worse in 
both severity and magnitude they need reliable, timely and 
accessible data and analysis to inform early warning and early 
action.Across most editions of the GRFC, data has been missing for 
seven countries (Congo, the Democratic People™s Republic 
of Korea, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, the Philippines and 
Sri Lanka), while for the ˆrst time in the ˜˚˜˚ report an 
assessment provided an estimate for the Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela.
While all partners are in broad agreement with the analysis 
provided in the report, divergences in interpreting the data 
related to the factors contributing to acute food insecurity in 
Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti 
have led to a disclaimer for these countries since the report 
.
Major data availability challenges, both for food security and 
nutrition, remain in inaccessible areas of countries and this 
year™s report highlights that there is no comparable analysis 
available for refugee populations.
The humanitarian and development community need to come 
together to better address the gaps in existing data collection 
systems, identify data and analysis standards where they don™t 
exist, engage with countries where there is limited data or 
consistent divergences in their interpretation.
The need to invest in technology-savvy monitoring systems 
and predictive analysis has become even more apparent in 
the context of COVID-˛˝. The data community must adapt its 
tools to provide timely, reliable measurement of the impact of 
COVID-˛˝ on food security and make the data easy to access, 
interpret and use by policymakers to enable them to make 
evidence-based decisions.20  | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020

 This marks the highest

Does this represent a major increase 
compared with previous years?
The number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase ˘

as a result of worsening acute food insecurity conditions in 
key conˇict-driven crises, notably the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo and South Sudan, and more severe droughts 
and economic shocks in Guatemala, Haiti, Pakistan, Zambia 
and Zimbabwe. Burkina Faso and the Niger in the Sahel, and 
Cameroon also saw big increases in the number of people in 
Crisis or worse (CH Phase ˘ or above), largely as a result of 
intensiˆed conˇict and greater displacement of people. 
However, the increeˇects 
increased geographical coverage thanks to greater data 
availability: in ˜˚˛˝, data became available for Angola, Namibia, 
Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania and the Bolivarian

Why is the situation worsening?As shown, the number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase

appears to be deepening. Conˇict/insecurity was still the primary 
driver of food crises in ˜˚˛˝. The total number of people in Crisis

crises rose fre than

violence continued to be fuelled by political, social and economic 
grievances or geopolitical tensions. 
In East Africa, armed conˇicts, violent extremism, intercommunal 
violence and other localized tensions continued to affect peace 
and security, particularly in South Sudan and continued to 
maintain large refugee populations in neighbouring countries, 
such as Uganda. 
In West Africa, there were two major hotspots: the Lake Chad 
Basin Œ which consists of sub-national areas in Cameroon, 
Chad, the Niger and northern Nigeria Œ and the Central Sahel

areas, insecurity led to massive displacement of populations,

In the ˛˚ worst food crises (by number of people in Crisis or

acutely malnourished children, the situation was particularly 
concerning in Pakistan, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the

nearly ˜˚ million wasted children,cent of the global 
total. 
Lack of nutritionally diverse diets for 
children in food crises  
In countries affected by food crises, where food availability and 
access to nutrient-rich food groups are severely restricted, the 
nutritional status of already vulnerable children is extremely 
concerning, with one out of two children stunted. In eight of the 
major food crises proˆled in this report morcent of 
children were stunted. See ˆgure ˛˜.
In ˛˚ countries among the worst food crises, fewer than ˜˚

markets may be disrupted during crises, making it more difˆcult 
for these groups to meet their dietary needs. 
Access to basic health services is critical to prevent the occurrence 
of disease outbreaks. High rates of illness compromise the 
nutritional status of the population, particularly children and 
pregnant and lactating women. 
In food-crisis countries, often a lack of safe water and sanitation 
increases the likelihood of disease outbreaks. In the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Chad, Ethiopia, Madagascar and South 
Sudan arcent of households or more did not have 
access to at least basic drinking water services. See ˆgur
Furthermore, people usually have limited economic access to 
health services or health systems have collapsed Œ with lack of 
infrastructure, medicines, equipment and trained staff. 
In Somalia, the ˜˚˛˝ ˇoods, coupled with impaired health 
systems among IDPs and other populations affected by conˇict, 
have resulted in cholera and measles outbreaks throughout 
the year, negatively affecting the nutrition status of children. 
There were also measles outbreaks in Chad and the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, and cholera outbreaks in Ethiopia, Mali, 
Yemen and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which also had 
the world's second biggest ever Ebola outbreak. 
Children in food crises are often not able to access preventive 
services such as micronutrient supplementation and 
immunization programmes, increasing the risk of them 
becoming malnourished.

 |  27Global trends in displacement
Conˇict, persecution, generalized violence and violations of 
human rights led to continued high levels of forced displacement 
in the ˆrst half  of ˜˚˛˝. At ˘˚ June ˜˚˛˝, UNHCR reported a 
total population of concern of This included 
˜˚.˜ million refugees under UNHCR™s mandate, ˘.
 million 
asylum-seekers,eturned refugees,s, 
˜.˘˙million returned IDPs and ˘.˝ million stateless people 
(UNHCR, February ˜˚˜˚). See ˆgur
The total number of Venezuelan refugees and migrants increased 
from under ˘.˛ million at the beginning of˛ 
million by the middle of the year. Conˇicts in sub-Saharan 
Africa, including in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African 
Republic, Ethiopia, Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Sudan, fueled new 
displacements in all these cases in ˜˚˛˝.More than half of all refugees under UNHCR™s mandate are 
hosted in eight countries that have very high numbers of people 
in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase ˘ or above) Œ sometimes because 
of the presence of the refugees. the world™s 
refugees are hosted in sub-Saharan Africa Œ the majority of them 
in East and the Horn of  with Uganda and the 
Sudan hosting the largest numbers in the region. See ˆgur 
Displacement fuels food insecurityDisplacement often results in a loss of livelihoods and 
productive assets as well as reduction in income and economic 
opportunities. There are often ˆnancial and physical costs 
associated with displacement. Refugee populations in particular 
often ˆnd it difˆcult to access food due to legal restrictions on 
their rights to work, access to land to cultivate food and freedom 
of movement. Refugee and internally displaced persons are 
often not successfully included in national services and systems, 
exposing them to greater risks of poverty and malnutrition. 
Refugees who settle in host countries with restrictive legal 
frameworks that impede their access to land, employment, 
freedom of movement and other basic human rights usually face

a heightened dependency on humanitarian support to meet their 
food and other basic needs. They often face abuse and/or stigma 
in the informal labour market. 
Food insecurity can trigger displacement
As well as being a possible outcome of displacement, food 
insecurity can trigger it, often exacerbated by and entwined with 
conˇict to form a vicious cycle. Limited or deteriorating access 
to productive assets such as land, water, livestock, agricultural 
inputs, as well as low agricultural productivity and/or price 
spikes reduce household food security and can be among the 
many push factors leading to migration and displacement. By its 
deˆnition, this is not forced displacement, but can be seen as a 
similar phenomenon that some have called ™survival migration™ 
(FAO et al, In conjunction with poverty, food insecurity may 
increase the likelihood and intensity of armed conˇict (Holleman 
et al, 
Migrants from Bangladesh and East and West Africa report food 
insecurity and economic vulnerability as key drivers for outward 
migration, while Syrians and Afghans claim that lack of safety and 
security as well as sustained conˇict that destroyed employment 
opportunities and markets, triggered their migration (WFP, May 
 Food shortages and high food prices were the leading 
causes of displacement reported by Venezuelans who ˇed to 
Colombia, Peru and Ecuador (WFP, ˜˚˛˝).
Acute food insecurity and nutrition 
In many host countries refugees' ability to obtain food in 
sufˆcient quantity and quality depends mostly on their access to 
humanitarian food assistance. Receive 
humanitarian food assistance to help promote food security 
and support livelihoods, but in some cases the size of rations 
and other basic assistance have been cut as a result of funding 
constraints (see box on refugees in Malawi on the following 
page). This has resulted not only in increased food insecurity and 
malnutrition, but greater protection risks as refugees engage in 
negative coping strategies to meet their essential needs (WFP, 
December ˜˚˛˝). 
While acute malnutrition among refugees is improving in many 
areas, it remains of major concern in Bangladesh, eastern Chad, 
Gambella (Ethiopia), South Sudan and the Sudan. Chronic 
malnutrition in refugee populations is extremely concerning with 
almost half of refugee sites above the 'very high' thr 
percent) for stunting. Two thirds of sites have very high anaemia 
prevalence which is greater than the threshold for public health 
concern (UNHCR, January ˜˚˜˚).

More than half reportedly want to develop businesses, engage

legal framework that denies them the rights to work, access to

half of the refugee households it is the main source of income 
(WFP, December ˜˚˛˝). But the ration was r

refugee families spending more than half on food compared 
to arcent before the cuts. The proportion of 
cent or more on food increased 
from arcent in ˜˚˛˝ (WFP,

income they have is used to purchase food. 
The proportion of refugee families with inadequate food 
consumption (i.e. poor or borderline diets) increased slightly 
frcent in ˜˚˛˝ Œ due mainly to 
an increase in those with ‚borderline™ diets. The consumption-
based coping strategies index reached its highest level, 
meaning that households were turning to negative coping 
strategies to maintain food consumption (transactional sex, 
begging, selling assets, theft etc). Vulnerable populations Œ 
women, girls, children, the ill, disabled and elderly Œ who have 
few other avenues for obtaining food were particularly likely to 
resort to coping strategies that are harmful to their wellbeing 
(UNHCR and WFP,
Recently, there have been pockets of protests by refugees 
in the camp over food cuts and insecurity, which have the 
potential to escalate. At the same time, Malawi is struggling 
with high national poverty rates so host communities lack the 
economic resilience to cope with and recover from shocks and 
stressors (UNHCR, March ˜˚˜˚).

In the ˆrst half of ˜˚˛˝ many agricultural and pastoral areas of 
the Horn of Africa experienced a second consecutive poor rainy 
season, following that of By late April, cumulative 
rainfall totals wercent below normal across much of 
the region (FAO-GIEWS, ˜˚˛˝).
The unfavourable weather conditions, among the driest on record 
in several areas, were largely caused by Tropical Cyclone Idai, 
which formed in early March in the Mozambique Channel and 
redirected precipitations away from East Africa (FSNWG, AprilŒ
May ˜˚˛˝). The severe dryness resulted in germination failure 
and crop wilting, with a negative impact on the planted area and 
yields. Above-average precipitation in late April and May reduced 
moisture deˆcits and marginally improved vegetation conditions, 
but damage to crops was irreversible in several cropping areas 
 as precipitation occurred too late during the growing season 
 (FAO-GIEWS, July ˜˚˛˝).

 |  31 Below-average harvests were also gathered in 
Ethiopia™s Belg/Gu/Genna receiving areas, Kenya™s south-eastern 
and coastal marginal agricultural zones and Uganda. An early 
depletion of household food stocks, coupled with rising market 
prices due to limited market supplies, restricted food access for 
many vulnerable households. 
The drought was particularly harsh for pastoralists, who were 
still recovering from the severe livelihood asset losses (e.g. 
animal herds) incurrought. Below-average 
rangeland conditions resulted in poor livestock body conditions, 
atypical livestock movements and related resource-based 
conˇicts, and limited milk availability for pastoral households. 
In October ˜˚˛˝, widespread ˇooding affected ne 
million people throughout the region (OCHA, January ˜˚˜˚), 
aggravating the effects of the recurrent drought and instability 
in the region by causing population displacements, livelihood 
disruption, and increased humanitarian needs. South Sudan, 
Somalia and Ethiopia were the most affected, while Kenya and 
Uganda experienced landslides as well as ˇooding. 
Conˇict/insecurity
Armed conˇicts, violent extremism, intercommunal violence and 
other localized tensions continued to affect peace and security 
across the whole region. It constituted the primary driver of acute 
 
Sudan and among refugee populations in Uganda who have ˇed 
from conˇict-affected neighbouring countries.
Efforts have been made to promote peace and security in the 
region and the United Nations Secretary General approved a 
Comprehensive Regional Prevention Strategy for the Horn of 
Africa in May ˜˚˛˝ (Ofˆce of the Special Envoy for the Horn of 
Africa, July ˜˚˛˝). The implementation of the peace agreement 
between Ethiopia and Eritrea has taken a positive trend and 
ushered in a new era of peace and cooperation between the two 
countries. 
However, progress towards implementation of the South Sudan 
peace agreement remained slow and the situation was still 
volatile, with frequent episodes of intercommunal violence. 
Al-Shabaab still posed a threat to peace and stability in Somalia 
and the wider region. Cross-border conˇicts continued to 
manifest in Mandera, where Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia meet 
(UNDP, July ˜˚˛˝), and Karamoja (Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan 
and Uganda), mainly driven by cattle rustling and disputes 
over access to water and pasture. According to ACLED data, the 
number of battles across the IGAD region fell fr

number of civilian fatalities remained the same at ˜ ˜˚˚ (ACLED,

confluence of weather and conflict shocks in South Sudan
2018Œ2019lives, increased dependency on aid, and forced many people to 
move to safer locations, abandoning their livelihoods and social 
ties. 
Economic shocks
Economic shocks were the primary driver of acute food insecurity 
 where the economic crisis 
worsened in ˜˚˛˝. Strong inˇationary pressures, the sharp 
currency depreciation that dampened private consumption and 
deterred investment (Economist Intelligence Unit, January ˜˚˜˚) 
and contraction of GDP, coupled with sanctions and shortages, 
pushed up fuel prices to exceptionally high levels. Prices of 
cereals, which started to sur, were at record 
highs by the end of ˜˚˛˝. (FAO-GIEWS, December ˜˚˛˝). Some 
cent of  households were estimated to be unable to afford 
the local food basket (WFP, ˜˚˛˝). Notably, in Khartoum state, the 
number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase ˘ or above) almost

food access constraints for market-dependent urban households. 
Ethiopia and South Sudan also faced severe macroeconomic 
challenges that resulted in extremely high food prices.
DisplacementAt the end of ˜˚˛˝, there werefugees and 
asylum seekers in the IGAD region. Some ˘˚˚ ˚˚˚ of the region™s 
refugees were newly arrived, seeking protection during the ˜˚˛˝ 
year. Around half of the refugees and asylum seekers originated 
from South Sudan, followed by Somalia, the Democratic Republic 
of Congo, the Sudan and Eritrea. An even higher number 
e internally displaced with the highest number 
in Somalia.According to UNHCR's mid-year trends East and Horn of Africa 
hosted ˜˛ percent of the world's refugees.

Uganda hosts the third largest number of refugees globally, and 
the highest number in the Greater Horn of Africa region (UNHCR, 
accessed January ˜˚˜˚). In ˜˚˛˝, persistent armed conˇict, 
inter-ethnic violence and limited access to basic social services 
drove over ˛˝˚ ˚˚˚ additional refugees and asylum seekers to 
seek refuge in the country, mainly from South Sudan and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, increasing the overall refugee 
 December ˜˚˛˝ 
(UNHCR, accessed January ˜˚˜˚). The Sudan hosted the ˆfth 
largest number of refugees in the world with around ˛.˛ million, 
mainly from South Sudan. See ˆgure ˜˘.
 Across the region, ar˛ percent of refugees were 
women and childrars of age, considered the 
most vulnerable to protection-related risks.  Some countries Œ 
particularly Ethiopia and the Sudan Œ have high numbers of IDPs, 
but are also hosting refugees or asylum seekers.
The refugee population remains heavily dependent on 
humanitarian food assistance to meet its minimum food and 
nutrition needs, but funding shortfalls have forced ration cuts in 
food and non-food assistance in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and the 
Sudan. Rations do not always cover the recommended ˜ ˛˚˚˙kcal 
per person per day, and from time to time are missing food 
commodities such as sugar, salt and fortiˆed foods. In addition, 
as a result of funding shortfalls, UNHCR was unable to provide 
adequate supplies of non-food assistance, which resulted in 
shortfalls in the supply of ˆrewood for cooking, water containers, 
soap, latrine access and adequate shelters in some of the refugee 
sites in the region. 
NutritionApproars of age (almost 
˛ in ˘ children) were stunted across the region, with 'very high' 
numbers in Ethiopia, the Sudan and Uganda. These children 
would likely not reach their full growth and developmental 
potential because of irreversible physical and cognitive damage 
caused by persistent nutritional deprivations at an early age. 
The levels of acute malnutrition remained high across the region, 
en suffering from acute 
malnutrition in six countries in ˜˚˛˝, including around ˜ million 
with life-threatening severe acute malnutrition. The highest 
numbers were in Ethiopia and the Sudan. See ˆgur

 |  33The Greater Karamoja Cluster encompasses the south-western 
parts of Ethiopia, north-western Kenya, the south-eastern parts 
of South Sudan and north-eastern Uganda. Pastoralism is the 
principal source of livelihood. Livestock transhumance is the 
key strategy employed by pastoralists and agropastoralist 
communities to cope with shocks and seasonal events.
Despite the ongoing efforts by IGAD and national 
governments, the cluster remains among the poorest and 
most acutely food insecure of the region. This cross-border 
region has the lowest social development indicators and 
the worst access to services when compared with national 
averages for each country. Although livestock represents the 
most important source of income and food for communities, 
the area is poorly integrated into national livestock health 
monitoring systems and market routes. In addition, frequent 
and persistent droughts are a recurrent feature of the area and 
their impact is exacerbated by advancing desertiˆcation and 
environmental degradation of rangelands. 
Changing borders within states have contributed to tensions 
and restricted the mobility of pastoral communities. 
In addition, extreme climatic events have worsened 
intercommunal conˇicts, increasing disputes over already 
scarce natural resources, straining pastoralists™ ability to move 
their herds beyond their communities™ own lands. For these 
reasons, pastoralists have become heavily armed to protect 
their herds as well as their communities.

The Greater Karamoja cross-border region has particularly low social development indicators and poor access to services when compared with national

East Africa's regional organization Œ IGAD
The Intergovernmental Authority on Development 
(IGAD) in Eastern Africa is a Regional Economic 
Community of eight countries: Djibouti, Eritrea, 
Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, the Sudan and 
Uganda. 
It was created in 1996 to supersede the 
Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and 
Development (IGADD), which was founded in 1986 to 
mitigate the effects of the recurring severe droughts 
and other natural disasters that resulted in widespread 
famine, ecological degradation and economic hardship 
in the region, such as during the Great African Famine of 
1982Œ84. 
The founding leaders of IGAD were motivated by a 
vision where the people of the region would develop 
a regional identity, live in peace and enjoy a safe 
environment, alleviating poverty through appropriate 
and effective sustainable development programmes. 
The IGAD Secretariat as the executive body of the 
Authority was given the mandate to achieve this goal.Source:

 See ˆgur
The Democratic Republic of the Congo was one of the world™s 
worst food crises in ˜˚˛˝. It has experienced decades of armed 
conˇict and displacement coupled with very high levels of 
poverty, weak political and economic governance, bad roads, 
lack of electricity, poor health, water and sanitation services, low 
agriculture productivity and limited access to cultivable land.    
The total ˆgure for the region is not comparable with that of 
(˜˘.˘ million) which did not include data for Angola, Namibia or 
the United Republic of Tanzania, which in ˜˚˛˝ accounted for ˜ 
million acutely food-insecure people. However, the analyses do 
show a grave deterioration in the acute food insecurity situation 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe and Zambia. 
Weather extremes
Southern Africa is experiencing the brunt of the climate crisis, 
see ˆgurate and 
many countries were buffeted by multiple weather shocks in ˜˚˛˝ 
(OCHA, November ˜˚˛˝). The region has had only two favourable 
agricultural seasons since ˜˚˛˜ and many areas have yet to fully 
recover from the devastating impact of 
(WFP, UNICEF and FAO, ˜˚˛˝). In ˜˚˛˝ Angola, Botswana, Namibia 
and Zimbabwe declared states of emergency due to drought.
At the start of the year dry conditions affected staple food 
production across Angola, Lesotho, southern Mozambique, 
northern Namibia, central South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 
Meanwhile in Malawi, ˇooding in Chikwawa led to loss of crops. 
Two tropical cyclones in Madagascar and Tropical Storm Desmond 
in Mozambique caused ˇooding and displacement (OCHA, 
February ˜˚˛˝). Then in March and April ˜˚˛˝, the region was hit 
by two consecutive tropical cyclones, Idai and Kenneth, that left a 
trail of death, damage and destruction in Malawi, Mozambique

harvest, destroying hundreds of thousands of acres of crops 
(OCHA, July ˜˚˛˝).
Southern parts of Zambia experienced the poorest rainfall 
se˛, which sharply reduced cereal crop production, 
leading to an increase in food import requirements (FAO-GIEWS, 
September ˜˚˛˝). 
Poor livestock body conditions and adverse weather triggered 
an increase in disease outbreaks among animals, leading to 
movement restrictions, which further curbed food availability, 
and lowered potential earnings for agricultural households 
(IAPRI, ˜˚˛˝). 
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo ˇooding, crop pests 
and below-average rains all disrupted the main season food crop 
production, which was forecast below the previous ˆve years, 
limiting market supplies and prompting an early start to the lean 
season in northern, central-eastern and south-eastern provinces 
(FAO and GIEWS, September ˜˚˛˝).
Economic shocks and weather extremes 
In ˜˚˛˝, Zimbabwe experienced its worst hunger crisis in a 
decade. The country has only experienced normal rainfall in 
one of the last ˆve growing seasons. At the same time it faced 
an economic crisis characterized by acute foreign exchange 
shortages, hyperinˇation, lack of fuel and prolonged power 
outages that crippled industry and work opportunities (WFP, 
December ˜˚˛˝). Extreme poverty was estimated to have risen 
from ˜˝ percent in ˜˚˛˝, which equates to 
 October ˜˚˛˝).
After ˇooding and landslides associated with Cyclone Idai caused 
severe damages to crop and agriculture infrastructure in March 
(OCHA, August ˜˚˛˝), the country then experienced its worst 
drought in decades, with temperatures hitees Celsius 
in some areas (WFP, January ˜˚˜˚).

below the ˆve-year average (FAO-GIEWS, October ˜˚˛˝), severely 
depleting the country™s strategic grain reserve. Data from the 
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe indicated that food prices increased 
cent from FebruaryŒDecember ˜˚˛˝. In Zambia, steep 
food price hikes, combined with lower incomes, sharply reduced 
households™ ˆnancial access to food.
Conˇict/insecurity
Although armed conˇict diminished in some areas  of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo in ˜˚˛˝, it intensiˆed in 
others, especially in the eastern areas of North Kivu, South Kivu 
and Ituri (ACLED, December ˜˚˛˝). Violence Œ around half of 
it against civilians Œ included inter-ethnic and intercommunal 
conˇicts, and clashes between multiple armed groups that 
attacked and obliterated villages, destroying ˆelds and harvests

Conˇict severely hindered the response to the Ebola outbreak and 
the number of cases increased dramatically from March ˜˚˛˝, 
making it the world™s second largest Ebola epidemic on record. 
The outbreak disrupted agricultural activities and limited people™s 
access to their livelihoods (FEWS NET, April ˜˚˛˝). 
The Democratic Republic of the Congo's vast IDP population (at 
 including almost a million forced to abandon their 
homes and livelihoods in ˜˚˛˝, it is the largest in Africa) as well 
efugees from Burundi, the Central African 
Republic, Rwanda and South Sudan (UNHCR, January ˜˚˜˚) were

Armed violence in Mozambique™s northern-most province of 
Cabo Delgado continued to force people to abandon their 
homes, crops, livelihoods and assets and prevent humanitarian 
organizations from reaching those in need and local populations 
from accessing basic services (ICRC, December ˜˚˛˝).
Nutrition 
Across the region, drought and ˇoods increased the rates of 
communicable disease outbreaks, a main driver of malnutrition. 
In ˜˚˛˝, there were cholera outbreaks in Angola, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, the United Republic of 
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe and measles outbreaks in 
Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and

 |  39the Niger and Senegal. The level of acute food insecurity in the 
Sahel was ˘ peralist areas 
were affected by prolonged dry spells compounded by conˇict 
and insecurity. 
Conˇict/insecurity
Conˇict/insecurity was the primary driver of acute food insecurity 
for ˛˚.˘ million people in six countries across the region (Burkina 
Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, the Niger and northern Nigeria). 
See ˆgur. Insecurity led to massive displacement 
of populations, destruction or closure of basic social services, 
disruption of productive activities, markets and trade ˇows. 
In particular, continuous insecurity in conˇict-affected areas, 
associated with renewed attacks, looting, banditry and border 
closure measures, affected market functioning and hindered 
access to ˆelds and to pastoral transhumance routes, incurring 
severe consequences for food security. 
There were two major hotspots: The Lake Chad Basin (see ˆgure 
˘˜) Œ made of sub-national areas in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and 
the Niger Œ and the Central Sahel crisis, which affected Burkina 
Faso, Mali and the Niger. In ˜˚˛˝, Burkina Faso was one of the 
world™s fastest growing crises with the daily lives and livelihoods 
of hundreds of thousands of civilians disrupted by insecurity and 
violence in central and northern regions. a 
state of emergency was declared in several provinces of Burkina 
Faso (WB, October ˜˚˛˝). 
In ˜˚˛˝, the West Africa and Sahel region hosted around 
˛.˜˙million re internally 
displaced. ˜˚˛˝, the number 
of IDPs in the Central Sahel countries increased dramatically 
because of insecurity Œ by ˘˚˚˙percent in the Niger™s regions of 
Tahoua and Tillabéry,cent 
in Burkina Faso. 
Despite humanitarian assistance, the food and nutrition situation 
of IDPs and refugees remained a major concern due to limited 
resources, continued displacement and limited humanitarian 
access. More than a third, 
in nine local government areas (LGAs) in Borno state, Nigeria, 
were in Crisis or worse (CH Phase˙˘ or above); similarly, 
ofefugees in ˆve ofˆcial camps in the Niger 
were in need of increased urgent assistance (RPCA-CILSS, ˜˚˛˝).
Weather extremes 
Weather extremes also played a critical role in shaping the 
food security situation in the region, mostly in tandem with the 
effects of conˇict and insecurity. They were the principal drivers 
of acute food insecurity in Cabo Verde, Côte d™Ivoire, the Gambia, 
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Senegal, where a total of 
e in Crisis or worse (CH Phase ˘ or above).

Recurrent shocks, such as localized deˆcits in cereal and forage 
production due to drought or ˇoods, have eroded people™s coping 
capacities. 
In ˜˚˛˝, ˇoods and heavy rains damaged crops in several areas 
in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d™Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, 
the Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Sierra Leone. Dry spells led to 
cereal production deˆcits in Cabo Verde and to fodder deˆcits in 
Mauritania and Senegal, as well as in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali 
and the Niger, which disrupted the transhumance patterns of 
pastoralists and led to a concentration of livestock in some non 
conˇict-affected areas of the four countries, increasing the risk of 
intercommunal tensions (RPCA, November ˜˚˛˝). 
Signiˆcant production shortfalls were expected in Cabo Verde, 
the Gambia, the Niger and Sierra Leone. In Guinea and Guinea-
Bissau, a combination of dry spells and ˇoods affected food 
security. 
Economic shocks
Economic shocks were the main drivers of acute food insecurity 
in Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the national currencies 
depreciated by ˜˜˙percent and ˛˚˙percent respectively compared 
 November ˜˚˛˝). Weather extremes, 
insecurity and below-average crop production also contributed to 
economic decline in other countries. Year-on-year inˇation rates 
in ˜˚˛˝ were above ˛˚˙percent in Liberia (˘˚.˝˙percent) Sierra 
Lcent), and close to 
˛˚˙percent in Guinecent). 
Cereal prices were generar 
average as supply was greater than demand across most of the 
sub-region. However, insecurity and market disruption in conˇict-
affected areas, such as the Lake Chad Basin and Liptako-Gourma 
pushed up food prices (FAO-GIEWS, December ˜˚˛˝).
NutritionThe nutrition situation remained alarming throughout many 
areas in the region as insecurity exacerbated pre-existing drivers 
of malnutrition by, for instance, forcing the closure of health 
centres. Lack of dietary diversity for childrars old 
was extremely concerning in some countries of the region, 
particularly in the Niger and Chad. See ˆgur 
While there was a slight decrease in the prevalence of acute 
malnutrition in some areas of the Niger and north-eastern

GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 
 |  41In recent years, acute food insecurity has increased 
signiˆcantly in cross-border areas. Although cross-border 
dynamics in food crises are largely context-speciˆc, there are 
some common vulnerabilities. 
Poverty and acute food insecurity levels are higher in 
the Central Sahel (e.g. in areas covered by l'Autorité de 
Développement Intégré du Liptako-Gourma [ALG]) and the 
Lake Chad Basin border areas than they are in other parts 
of those countries. Local populations are largely engaged 
in agriculture and pastoralism, and in the case of the Lake 
Chad Basin, ˆshing, and are therefore highly dependent on 
dwindling natural resources. The increased intensity and 
frequency of climatic shocks Œ such as recurring droughts in 
the Central Sahel Œ are further degrading natural assets (e.g. 
cropland, water resources, pastures) and generating increased 
competition over those resources, thereby increasing the risk 
of intercommunal violence, for example between pastoralist 
groups and farmers.
The Central Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin are also 
characterized by a lack of presence of State systems, including 
limited access to basic services, the absence of security forces 
and administrative authorities, and limited border control. 
These limitations are particularly applicable to pastoralist 
communities, who are under-represented in local public 
institutions (FAO, forthcoming). 
The combination of these factors makes pastoral communities 
particularly vulnerable. On the one hand, this is due to the 
mobile nature of their livelihoods, which constrains access 
to basic services; on the other, the degradation of natural 
resources not only disrupts their normal transhumance routes, 
but it also impoverishes their livelihoods.   
Armed groups and transnational organized criminal gangs 
have also proˆted from the absence of State control, limited 
border control and marginalized local populations, enabling 
them to operate in multiple countries, disrupt regional trade, 
or impose their rule on communities., insecurity 
and armed groups have spread from the north and centre of 
Mali across the borders of the Liptako-Gourma areas into the 
Niger and Burkina Faso, with civilians often the victims of 
violence and displacement widespread, particularly in Burkina 
Faso. Insecurity has also severely disrupted regional trade, 
notably in the Sahel regions of Burkina Faso, Mopti in Mali, 
and Tillabéri in the Niger (RPCA, ˜˚˛˝). 
The limited presence of the State in the Lake Chad Basin has 
facilitated the rise of violent activity by Boko Haram or Boko 
Haram-afˆliated armed gr Armed groups 
beneˆt from ˇuid borders to engage in criminality, banditry 
and attacks against communities across state lines, leading to 
a growing tide of refugee and internally displaced populations 
and placing additional pressure on the food security status of 
both host and displaced communities. The persistent insecurity 
in the Lake Chad Basin, in addition to border closures in 
Nigeria, have also affected trade in the region, contributing 
to higher food prices and limited access to markets in certain 
regions (RPCA, ˜˚˛˝). Violence has  inhibited humanitarian 
access to vulnerable populations in both the Central Sahel and 
the Lake Chad Basin, (FAO-GIEWS, ˜˚˛˝).

Termanent Interstate Committee for Drought 
Control (CILSS) is a regional organization, consisting 
ofegion. Its objectives are 
to invest in research for food security and the ˘ght 
against the effects of dr
the Sahel. The 13 countries are Benin, Burkina Faso, 
Cabo Verde, Chad, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, 
Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, the Niger, Senegal 
and Togo. It facilitates the consistent use of the Cadre 
Harmonisé (CH) by 18 countries in West Africa and the 
Sahel (its member states, members of the regional 
Food Crisis Prevention Network (RPCA) and Cameroon) 
to prevent food crises by quickly identifying affected 
populations and proffering appropriate measures to 
improve their food and nutrition security.
The Réseau de Prévention des Crises Alimentaires 
(RPCA) is an international consultation and co-
ordination platform co-ordinated by the CILSS drawing 
on the political leadership of the Communauté 
Economique Des Etats de l™Afrique de l™Ouest (CEDEAO 
or ECOWAS) and Union Economique et Monétaire 
Ouest Africaine (UEMOA) Commissions, and includes 
all CILSS countries, plus Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria and 
Sierra Leone. As an open forum for discussion and 
information-sharing, the network analyses the food 
and nutritional situation of the region, and promotes 
consistent and concerted action. 
CEDEAO itself is made up of 15 member countries that 
have both cultural and geopolitical ties and shared 
common economic interest. The countries are: Benin, 
Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Côte d™Ivoire, the Gambia, 
Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, the Niger, 
Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. 
UEMOA consists of countries that have the CFA Franc in 
common. Its member states are Benin, Burkina Faso, 
Côte d™Ivoire, Mali, the Niger, Senegal and Togo.
The G5 Sahel is a joint regional force, bringing 
together Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, the Niger 
and Chad, and supported by the African Union and the 
United Nations.Created in February 2014, this regional force aims 
at improving the coordination of the countries at a 
regional level for development policies and security 
and defence activities. It aims especially at ˘ghting 
the terrorist threat, starting with the securitization of

insecure and in need of urgent assistance across ˛˚ countries 
in the Middle East and South/South East Asia in ˜˚˛ˆ.  
Yemen remained the world™s gravest food crisis in ˜˚˛˝. High 
acute food insecurity levels persisted in Bangladesh™s Cox™s Bazar, 
Palestine, the Syrian Arab Republic, Yemen and among Syrian 
refugees in Turkey in ˜˚˛˝, with slight improvements in the 
situation in Iraq and Lebanon. While the numbers of acutely food-
insecure people increased in Afghanistan and Pakistan™s Sindh 
and Balochistan provinces, this was mainly linked with the higher 
analysis coverage in ˜˚˛˝. See ˆgur
Conˇict/insecurity
Protracted armed conˇict and violence, frequently fuelled by 
political, social and economic grievances or geopolitical tensions 
remained the main drivers of acute food insecurity across the 
region (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝). See ˆgur.
In Yemen, although violence abated in the critical port city of 
tockholm Agreement, conˇict 
increased in other areas and ˆghting continued across ˛˚ out of 
˜˜ governorates. The protracted conˇict continued to severely 
disrupt economic activity, damage infrastructure, destroy basic 
public services (WB, October ˜˚˛˝) and to restrict access to 
markets and services (ACAPS, October ˜˚˛˝). 
Nine years into the crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic the scale 
and complexity of humanitarian needs and protection concerns 
remained high. In the north-east, increased conˇict since the 
onset of the Turkish-led military offensive in October ˜˚˛˝ 
resulted in civilian deaths and signiˆcant displacement (OCHA, 
December ˜˚˛˝).Fighting in Afghanistan continued, prompting the displacement 
of December 
˜˚˛˝). From JulyŒSeptember the number of civilian casualties 
was the highest since ˜˚˚˝ (UNAMA, October ˜˚˛˝).
In Iraq, the formal conclusion of major military operations against 
the Islamic State of Iraq and the L 
the way for millions of displaced Iraqis to return home. But 
intercommunal and societal tensions persisted on multiple fronts 
and the spectre of armed conˇict and renewed displacement 
lingered (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝).

In Gaza, the ongoing blockade, combined with regular ˇare-ups 
of hostilities, affected all aspects of civilian life and threatened to 
ignite a wider confrontation (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝).
Humanitarian organizations in the region faced multiple 
challenges that obstructed their access to populations in need 
of assistance. The operating environment in Yemen has become 
one of the most non-permissive in the world. At le˛ million 
d-to-reach districts have been cut off from 
humanitarian assistance by restrictions imposed by authorities 
(OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝).
In Iraq, widespread protests and insecurity had signiˆcant 
impacts on humanitarian operations. Intermittent curfews were 
imposed in Baghdad and the southern governorates, resulting in 
missions being delayed or cancelled. In Ninewa, United Nations 
agencies and NGOs were unable to carry out relief activities in 
camps because of delays in getting approvals and access letters 
(OCHA, November ˜˚˛˝). 
Violations of international humanitarian law, including attacks on 
health and education facilities, continued to make Afghanistan 
one of the most dangerous countries in the world for aid 
agencies to operate (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝).
Economic declineThe economic decline and lack of sustainable livelihoods that 
accompany protracted conˇict have exhausted individual and 
community coping mechanisms. In Yemen, acute shortages of 
foreign exchange and collapse in government revenues have 
interrupted the purchase of essential imports and payment of 
public sector salaries and pensions (WB, October ˜˚˛˝). Around 
two in ˆve Yemeni households have lost their primary source of 
income and ˆnd it difˆcult to buy even the minimum amount of 
food (WB, October ˜˚˛˝). 
The depreciation of the Syrian Pound against the USD, high 
unemployment, low salaries, high competition for labour 
opportunities and escalating food prices curtailed Syrians™ 
purchasing power (WFP, ˜˚˜˚).
In Afghanistan, poverty increased, with morcent of 
people living on less than USD ˛.˝˚ per day (OCHA, December 
˜˚˛˝). In Gaza, unemployment increased in the second 
quarter of ˜˚˛˝,cent, the 
highest in the world. Nearly half the population was living 
below the poverty line (WB, September ˜˚˛˝). In the Syrian 
Arab Republic households™ purchasing power was limited by 
high unemployment, low salaries, high competition for labour 
opportunities and rising food prices (CFSAM, September ˜˚˛˝).

farmed lands and work opportunities and were facing a sharp 
drop in daily wages due to the increased supply of unskilled 
labour (JRP, March ˜˚˜˚).
Weather extremes
Some countries in the region also experienced extreme climate 
events in ˜˚˛˝. In Sindh province of Pakistan, 
season rains wercent below average and in 
Balochistan they wercent below average, resulting in 
acute shortages of water, food and fodder into ˜˚˛˝. 
In Afghanistan, some households had still not fully recovered 
their lost livelihood asought (FEWS˙NET, 
October ˜˚˛˝), while hundreds of thousands were affected by 
seasonal ˇoods across almost all provinces (OCHA, December 
˜˚˛˝). In September, Cox™s Bazar experienced heavy monsoon 
rains that triggered serious landslides and ˇooding.
In Iraq, heavy March/April rains caused ˇooding in central and 
southern governorates that caused temporary displacement and 
disrupted clean water supplies in some areas (OCHA, May ˜˚˛˝). 
In the Syrian Arab Republic, Hasakah Governorate faced the 
worst ˇooding in a decade (IFRC, April ˜˚˛˝) following heavy 
rains in late March, affecting vulnerable IDPs and causing 
damage to homes and agricultural land (IFRC, April ˜˚˛˝). High 
temperatures and strong winds caused ˆres on standing crops

In Yemen, ar 
 Even countries 
with large numbers of internally displaced people, such as 
Yemen, the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq, are also hosting 
hundreds of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers from 
countries in the region.
Refugees and IDPs  Œ as well as returns of both Œ often settle in 
urban centres, straining basic services, increasing competition 
for scarce labour opportunities and reducing daily wages for 
the hosts by providing cheaper competition. This is a concern 
in Afghanistan, Iraq, the countries hosting Syrian refugees and 
Bangladesh™s Cox™s Bazar district.
NutritionMillions of children under the age ofoss the Middle East

by lowering access to nutritious food (see ˆgur forcing

In May ˜˚˛˝, an estimated ˛˚.cent 
of the population) were in need of food assistance. 
percent of surveyed households had an acceptable diet that 
included a more frequent intake of high-protein foods and 
fruits. The other ˝˘ percent with poor and borderline food 
consumption had a daily diet that was insufˆcient in diversity 
and nutrients. 
The situation was expected to further deteriorate during the 
lean season from May to September ˜˚˛˝ unless urgent 
humanitarian action was taken (FAO/WFP, May ˜˚˛˝).
The main drivers were prolonged dry spells, abnormally high 
temperatures and ˇoods that severely r 
season cereal production (mostly rice and maize). The early 
season wheat, potato and barley crops, harvested in June 
and important to ˆll food gaps during the lean season, were 
affected by low snow cover, which exposed crops to freezing 
temperatures, limited water availability and poor rains. 
Sanctions-related shortages of fuel, electricity and lack of spare 
parts for agricultural equipment also contributed to pushing 
the aggreal production to well below the 
previous ˆve-year average. Post-harvest losses were higher 
than usual due to fuel and electricity shortages that hampered 
the timely transport and processing of crops as well as the 
ventilation of stocks. Feting year, the 
uncovered cere 
tonnes (FAO/WFP, May ˜˚˛˝).
Limited arcent of the largely 
mountainous country is suitable for cultivation) and lack of 
irrigation also curtail domestic production (WFP, November 
˜˚˛˝). The Government continues to rely on international 
humanitarian assistance, which is challenged by lack of 
funding as well as by lack of banking channels for in-country 
operational costs (UNRC, March ˜˚˛˝). 
The population relies on the Public Distribution System (PDS)
and any reduction in the entitlements affects food security 
nationwide (UNRC, March ˜˚˛˝). From January ˜˚˛˝, rations 
reduced to ˘˚˚ grammes per person per day, a ˜˛ percent fall 
comparom the 
˜˚˛˝ target ofammes. Further reductions were expected 
until September when the main crops would be available 
(FAO/WFP, May ˜˚˛˝). 
PDS households had to rely on markets and kinship support 
to ˆll the food gap. WFP™s regular market monitoring surveys 
found a general trend of increasing market prices in early ˜˚˛˝ 
compar which was likely to cause further stress on 
people™s access to food and worsen overall food consumption 
(FAO/WFP, May ˜˚˛˝).
Food insecurity and malnutrition are strongly interrelated. 
Diet diversity is inadequate and particularly young children 
and pregnant and lactating women suffer from chronic

Disclaimer: The GRFC team acknowledges that there are notable limitations to the use of the Rapid Food Security Assessment to estimate the population in need according to IPC Phases. The estimate 
relies on one indicator, specifically the Food Consumption Score, and the population in need was determined to be equivalent to the population reporting a Poor Food Consumption Score. The data was 
purposively sampled and consisted of 179 households, 125 of whom were surveyed in November 2018 and 54 of whom were surveyed in early 2019. For this reason this figure has not been included in the 
total figure (135 million) or in the chapter 2 table.

the currency and import difˆculties Œ led to a reduction in the 
planted area and expected below-average maize harvest (OCHA, 
November ˜˚˛˝). Consequently, reliance on imported food 
increased, but with dwindling foreign exchange earnings, food 
shortages became increasingly pressing. 
In Haiti, the political and socioeconomic crisis was the primary 
driver of worsening acute food insecurity in ˜˚˛˝. The resignation 
of the former Government in March led to a slowdown or halt 
of public services and suspension of bilateral investment and 
support, while the depreciation of the Haitian Gourde triggered 
high inˇation and record or near record high food prices. Urban 
unemployment soared and the most vulnerable households in 
rural areas lacked agricultural work opportunities.  
Vulnerable households and smallholders in the Dry Corridor area 
were also affected by poor economic conditions and reduced 
purchasing power. Low international coffee prices as well as 
increases in input costs severely affected production and the 
incomes of the ˛.˘ million producers and pickers who rely on 
the sector for their livelihoods across the region. High beans and 
maize prices had a dire impact on poor households that spend a 
high proportion of their total expenditure on food. In April, WFP 
found that among its beneˆciaries in the Central American Dry 
Corridor (Ccent of households had insufˆcient cash to 
purchase the minimum food basket (WFP, ˜˚˛˝).
Weather extremes
The world™s second-most disaster-prone region, Latin America 
and the Caribbean is feeling the impact of climate change, 
with stronger seasonal hurricanes in the Atlantic and recurring 
climate shocks in Central America compounding socioeconomic 
vulnerabilities and economic inequity (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝). 
In ˜˚˛˝, acute food insecurity in the Dry Corridor was primarily 
driven by drought, which adversely affected subsistence maize 
and beans farmers, small coffee farmers and agricultural 
labourers who had not yet fully recovered from the sever 
drought and ˆve years of erratic seasonal weather patterns. The 
drought was severe in eastern El Salvador, most of Guatemala, 
central, eastern and southern Honduras, and central and northern 
Nicaragua. Aggregate maize crop production was forecast at ˛. 
million tonnes below average in Guatemala, 
in Honduragua (FAO-GIEWS, 
OctoberŒDecember ˜˚˛˝). 
The Caribbean region comprises many small island developing 
states (SIDS) that are especially susceptible to a wide range 
of natural hazards Œ including droughts, earthquakes, ˇoods, 
hurricanes and landslides Œ which cause an estimated USD˙˘ 
billion in annual losses. With climate change expected to increase 
the intensity of extreme weather events, Caribbean countries 
are faced with formidable challenges in protecting people, 
livelihoods and infrastructure and in maintaining their economic, 
social and environmental gains (WFP, ˜˚˛˝).

Economic shocks 
Sustainable, paid employment is scarcent rely 
on self-employment, daily labour or unpaid work. A quarter of 
the labour force is unemployed (WB, October ˜˚˛˝). Returnees 
(mainly from Iran) compete with residents for work, leading to 
labour supply further outstripping demand and depressing daily 
wage rates (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝). Remittances from Iran were 
below average due to worsening economic conditions there. 
Casual labour opportunities were below the ˆve-year average 
because of lower demand in construction and other industrial 
sectors (FEWS˙NET, June ˜˚˛˝). Daily wage labour rates were 
below the two-year average, leading to an overall decrease in 
household purchasing power (FEWS˙NET, October˙˜˚˛˝).
According to the Seasonal Food Security Assessment, of the 
cent of households that claimed to have experienced 
shocks, ˜˝˙percent referred to loss of employment,cent

Nationwide, some households had not fully recovered their

been repatriated (Government of Angola, September ˜˚˛˝). By 
the end of November the country still hosted ar 
refugees, including ˛˜˙˚˚˚ Congolese (UNHCR, December

FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYWeather extremes
In early ˜˚˛˝ erratic and below-average rainfall negatively 
affected crop yields Œ particularly of maize Œ at the national 
level. Vegetation stress was reported over the east-west belt 
(JRC-GDO, October ˜˚˛˝). Pest infestations (fall armyworm and 
birds) also contributed to low maize yields (IPC, October ˜˚˛˝). 
As a result, the ˜˚˛˝ cerecent

below the ˆve-year average (FAO-GIEWS, October ˜˚˛˝). In 
some areas agricultural campaigns failed completely. Millet

herd sizes decreased (IPC, October ˜˚˛˝). The ˜˚˛˝/˜˚˜˚ 
cereal import requirements increased to meet the deˆcit 
of ˛.˜˙million metric tonnes (SADC, July ˜˚˛˝) with maize 
cent above average. 
The three southern provinces of Cuando Cubango, Cunene 
and Huila, which produce a minor share of the national cereal 
production, were severely affected by drought. Given the 
severe dry conditions, livestock body conditions deteriorated 
as a result of poor pasture and water availability (FAO-GIEWS, 
October ˜˚˛˝), and local populations faced loss of assets, 
displacements and signiˆcantly disrupted livelihoods (IPC,

Economic shocks

ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY 
OVERVIEW
In ˜˚˛˝, ˛.˘ million people were food insecure and in need 
of humanitarian food and livelihood assistance in Cox™s 
Bazar district of Bangladesh. Around two thirds of them 
were Rohingya rTeknaf 
e members of the Bangladeshi host 
community (JRP, March ˜˚˜˚).
According to the latest Refugee inˇux Emergency Vulnerability 
Assessment, the percentage of refugee households with 
inadequate food consumption remained unchanged at 
cent (REVA ˘, ˜˚˛˝) comparcent in 
A˙˜, Arcent of refugees 
were entirely dependent on assistance to help them meet 
their minimum essential needs (REVA ˘, ˜˚˛˝).
Buying food on credit, borrowing money to buy food and 
selling off humanitarian assistance continued to be the most 
adopted coping strategies to support consumption in ˜˚˛˝ 
(REVA ˘, ˜˚˛˝). Half of refugee households were buying food 
on credit or borrowing money to buy food, a reduction from

could be due to people losing their credit worthiness.

largely to assistance provided by the Government and 
humanitarian community and resilience of the Rohingya. But 
socio-economic challenges, such as poverty and constrained 
self-reliance opportunities, raise serious food security concerns 
(UNHCR/WFP, October ˜˚˛˝).

in income generation, single parents and child-headed

consumption dropped from ˘˚ percent to ˜˛ percent and 
utilization of consumption-based coping strategies remained 
low. The share of households that purchased food on credit 
and/or were borrowing money to buy food halved from around 
cent in ˜˚˛˝ Œ although again, 
this seeming improvement could be attributed to people 
losing their credit worthiness. 
DRIVERS OF ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYConˇict/insecurity
Despite progress, the stateless Rohingya still face an extremely 
precarious future as the root causes of the conˇict in Myanmar 
have not been addressed (OCHA, accessed January ˜˚˜˚). 
 UNDP and the Government of Myanmar 
signed an agreement to create conditions conducive to 
their return (JRP, January ˜˚˛˝). But until these refugees/
Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals are given citizenship 
in Myanmar and ofˆcially recognized and accepted as one of 
many ethnic groups in the country with the same rights as 
all Myanmar nationals, they will remain as refugees in the 
camps in Cox´s Bazar and compelled to rely upon government 
support and humanitarian aid (UNHCR/ WFP, October ˜˚˛˝). 
Incidents of tension and violence have been observed, both 
in camps and between refugees and host communities, 
exacerbated by congested conditions in the camps and 
limited opportunities for education and skills development. 
Relocations and displacement related to weather hazards, 
inter-community tensions and new arrivals increased the need 
for rapid food assistance (JRP, January ˜˚˛˝).
Economic shocks
Displacement from Myanmar has almost tripled the total 
population in Ukhiya and Teknaf Upazilas, with profound 
consequences for the Bangladeshi residents. While the rapid 
population increase has brought economic opportunities to 
segments of the local population, the inˇux has led to higher 
inˇation and a sharp drop in daily wages due to the increased 
supply of unskilled labour (JRP, January ˜˚˛˝).
The food and nutrition security of the poorest among the 
host community is a growing concern. Many have lost 
access to previously farmed land/forest and have lost work 
opportunities to the cheaper refugee labour market. Forest

Cox™s Bazar experienced ˜˚˚Œ˘˚˚mm of rain, which triggered 
serious landslides and ˇash ˇooding, particularly in the low-

rapidly deteriorating and there is a possibility that Malian 
refugees will spontaneously relocate to safer areas.
Refugee acute food insecurity deteriorated signiˆcantly

with inadequate food consumption increasing from ˜˚˙percent

FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYConˇict/insecurity
The security situation deteriorated as violence spread from the 
northern regions to eastern parts. A state of emer 
provinces Œ declarxtended until 
January ˜˚˜˚ (ACAPS, December ˜˚˛˝). 
The number of violent incidents in ˜˚˛˝ was almost three 
 while reported civilian deaths 
in the ˆrst half of the year were four times higher than the 
CLED, January ˜˚˜˚). The severity of the 
conˇict contributed to the displacement of 
as of December ˜˚˛˝, up frJanuary (UNHCR, 
December ˜˚˛˝). In conˇict-affected areas, agricultural 
activities decrecent, while land cultivation 
drcent compar Difˆculties in 
accessing ˆelds, the destruction of production infrastructure, 
and looting and loss of livestock disrupted market functioning 
and households™ livelihoods (FAO, October ˜˚˛˝). 
Consequently, displaced populations faced a major deˆcit 
in the quality and quantity of food consumption since they 
were unable to resort to other coping or adaptation strategies 
(RPCA, November ˜˚˛˝). Conˇict cut off humanitarian access 
to a number of camp areas and IDP
-hosting areas, particularly 
in the Sahel region, where a large number of IDPs and the 
majority of Malian refugees were located (UNHCR, May ˜˚˛˝).
Economic shocks
Conˇict constrained access to markets in the Sahel region 
and vulnerable households were obliged to rely on host 
communities and humanitarian assistance (AVI, November 
˜˚˛˝). Insecurity disrupted normal livestock market 
functioning (RPCA, November ˜˚˛˝), particularly in northern 
regions. However, livestock prices remained stable or declined 
cent relative to the average (FEWS˙NET, November 
˜˚˛˝). Although weak cereal prices ensured favourable terms 
of trade for livestock owners as of November ˜˚˛˝, a rapid 
deterioration was forecast in areas suffering from limited 
fodder resources due to insecurity (RPCA, November ˜˚˛˝).
Incomes from cash crop production and sales were expected 
to remain below average because of localized declines in 
production (FEWS˙NET, December ˜˚˛˝).

BACKGROUND
A country endowed with rich natural resources, Cameroon 
enjoyed several decades of stability, but in recent years it has 
been grappling with attacks by armed groups in the Far North 
and for the past four years with a secessionist insurgency in 
the North-West and South-West Anglophone regions (WB, 
October ˜˚˛˝).cent of Cameroonians were 
living in extreme poverty (USD˛.˝˚ a day) (WB). Refugees 
from the Central African Republic and Nigeria are in areas 
already deprived of social services and development support.

entral African Republic refugees were in need 
of food assistance, with poverty the main driver. Funding 
shortfalls caused a break in all food assistance, raising 
extreme concerns about food security in the near future (WFP, 
January ˜˚˛˝). Rural areas in Anglophone regions are often 
inaccessible to humanitarian agencies making it hard to 
assess IDPs™ needs or provide them with aid (OCHA, ˜˚˛˝). 
FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYConˇict/insecurity
Cameroon is experiencing the impact of three distinct, 
complex humanitarian crises fuelled primarily by violence 
and insecurity (OCHA, January ˜˚˛˝). In the Far North the 
security situation stemming from the Lake Chad Basin 
worsened in ˜˚˛˝, with the number of Boko Haram incursions 
increasing from ˜˚ per month between January and August 
ee months. Communes along the 
border with Nigeria faced abductions, livestock theft and 
destruction of property (OCHA, ˜˚˛˝). Incursions constrained 
agricultural production, causing localized production shortfalls 
and prevented people from moving far, limiting income 
generation, especially in places where border trade is an 
important means of livelihood (FEWS˙NET, December ˜˚˛˝). 
By the end of the year the Far North hosted ar 
IDPs (IOM DTM, November ˜˚˛˝) and around ˛˚˝˙˚˚˚ 
Nigerian refugees (UNHCR, December ˜˚˛˝). 
In the Anglophone regions, what began as a political crisis 
turned into a signiˆcant, complex humanitarian emergency 
(OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝). Although the conˇict diminished 
in intensity from September, the security situation remained 
precarious as clashes persisted between separatists and the 
national army. Roadblocks, general strikes, kidnappings, ˆres 
and destruction of property continued to impair livelihoods, 
prompting people to ˇee towards forests or urban centres. 
Limited access to ˆelds and lack of maintenance of plantations 
diminished crop production by comparison with the pre-crisis 
period (FEWS˙NET, December ˜˚˛˝). 
By December ˜˚˛˝, the Anglophone rs 
eturnees. Stripped of their assets, livelihoods 
and ability to grow crops, these people could not ensure their 
food security without assistance from aid agencies or host 
households or the use of negative coping strategies (UNHCR, 
˜˚˛˝). This displacement has strained the resources and 
livelihoods of the host population too.

In the Mayo Danay department in the Far North region, crops 
were destroyed by ˇoods, birds and fall armyworm (CILSS-CH,

food availability locally (FEWS˙NET, November ˜˚˛˝). Localized 
ˇoods afogone-et-Chary

and depleting stocks at the end of the lean season (OCHA,

to vulnerable populations, led to new displacements, and 
aggravated the already serious humanitarian situation. 
Economic shocks
In the North-West and South-West regions the closure of land 
borders curbed trade and added additional upward pressure 
on prices in border markets (FEWS˙NET, ˜˚˛˝).

FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYConˇict/insecurity 
Despite the peace agreement, the level of violence and attacks 
only decreased temporarily throughout the country and the 
overall levels of violence remained worrying, with women 
and children among the most affected (MINUSCA, October 
˜˚˛˝). After a decline in June and July, violence intensiˆed 
in August and September, including in areas previously 
unaffected. Clashes in August led to the displacement of an 
estimated ˛˘˙˚˚˚ civilians (UNSC, October ˜˚˛˝). Violence 
and armed groups hindered humanitarian access with more 
than ˛˚˚ attacks reported between January and August 
(ACAPS, September ˜˚˛˝). As of ˘˚˙November, 
people were still internally displaced, with almost two in three 
living among host communities (Shelter Cluster, November 
˜˚˛˝). Basic services were dysfunctional or non-existent in 
many areas of the country, and people™s access to livelihood 
opportunities severely hindered (FAO,˙October˙˜˚˛˝). 
Violence and insecurity constrained food production because 
of abandonment and lack of access to ˆelds, particularly in the 
eastern and south-eastern areas (IPC, June ˜˚˛˝). However, 
thanks to voluntary returns of farmers and overall adequate 
and well-distributed rainfall, ˜˚˛˝ agricultural output was 
estimated to be above-average Œ but still below pre-crisis 
levels. Localized production shortfalls were reported in Basse 
Kotto, Mbomou and Ouaka due to the activities of armed 
groups (FAO-GIEWS, December ˜˚˛˝). 
Raiding, theft and attacks by armed groups have devastated 
the livestock sector. Pastoralist mobility remained difˆcult 
in north-western areas, exacerbating tensions with farmer 
communities and affecting livestock herding and production 
(FAO, October˙˜˚˛˝). Lack of vaccinations increased animal 
disease outbreaks (FAO, March ˜˚˛˝).

A bowl of cassava was six times more expensive in eastern 
markets than in western in September. The same month, the 
closure of the border between the Sudan and Vakaga and 
Upper Kotto prefectures in response to the hostilities had a 
further negative impact on trade (FEWS˙NET, September ˜˚˛˝). 
In November, insecurity-related supply and trade disruptions 
kept the prices of cassava,cent higher

Returnees, IDPs and refugees faced lack of assets and inputs

Acute food insecurity among refugees
According to UNHCR, as of ˘˛ October ˜˚˛˝, the country 
efugees from neighbouring countries, 
mainly from the Sudan, the Central African Republic and 
Nigeria (UNHCR, accesJanuary ˜˚˜˚). This includes 
around ˘˘˘˙˚˚˚ Sudanese refugees, who arrived since ˜˚˚˘, 
living in ˛˜ camps along the border with the Sudan in eastern 
Chad; around ˝˚˙˚˚˚ Central African refugees, who arrived 
since ˜˚˚˘, living in six camps in the south and around 
˛˜˙˚˚˚ Nigerian refugees from the Boko Haram insurgency 
living in one camp and villages in the Lake Chad region 
(UNHRC, October ˜˚˛˝).
The majority of displaced people, refugees and host 
communities are highly dependent on humanitarian 
assistance to satisfy their basic needs. However, as one of 
the poorest countries in the world, Chad™s capacity to provide 
assistance is limited (ECHO, June ˜˚˛˝). 
The acute food insecurity status of refugees remained critical 
and deteriorating, most notably among the Sudanese 
refugees from Darfur in the regions of Wadi Fira, Ouaddai, 
Sila and Salamat, near Chad™s border with the Sudan (UNHCR, 
November ˜˚˛˝; OCHA April ˜˚˛˝). In Centre East, some 
cent of Sudanese refugees were moderately or 
severely food insecure (UNHCR, February ˜˚˛˝ and UNHCR, 
 Faced with limited livelihood opportunities, 
refugees in the North and Centre East resorted to use of

FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYConˇict/insecurity
Deteriorating insecurity linked to Boko Haram and military 
operations in the Lac region as well as increasing violence 
linked to militant and criminal groups in the Tibesti region 
(ACAPS, ˜˚˛˝) impeded trade ˇows and the movement of 
people and animals, degrading food availability, livelihoods 
and food access (FEWS˙NET, August ˜˚˛˝). In addition, 
insecurity forced pastoralists to stay close to cities, increasing 
tensions between herders and farmers. 
Lac, Ouaddai, Sila and Tibesti regions were all under a 
state of emergency due to ongoing violence, preventing 
affected populations from accessing their livelihoods and 
humanitarian assistance (ACAPS, October ˜˚˛˝).
The protracted violence and insecurity in the Lac and Tibesti 
regions increased the number of internally displaced people 
fr 
October (UNHCR, ˜˚˛˝).
Weather extremes
While abundant rs 
cereal prcent above the ˆve-year average, 
improved pasture conditions (FAO-GIEWS, June ˜˚˛˝) and 
kept food prices below their ˆve-year average, longer-than-
usual dry spells and pests decreased crop production in 
the Sahelian belt (CILSS-CH, November ˜˚˛˝). In recent 
years recurrent drought has stressed livelihoods and made 
households less able to cope with and recover from any type 
of shock (FAO, April ˜˚˛˝). 
Rains caused widespread ˇooding in many provinces, 
af October. Around half 
of these people were in the southern province of Mayo-Kebbi 
East, where torrential rains and ˇoods caused extensive 
destruction of houses, loss of animals, food stocks and other 
assets (OCHA, November ˜˚˛˝).
Economic shocks
In Tibesti, households™ limited income, mainly from petty 
trade, the black market, livestock sales, remittances from 
migrant workers and gold panning, has fallen since the 
conˇict started, while the cost of food in markets has remained 
high. A signiˆcant proportion of food in markets is imported 
from Libya or other parts of Chad, but trade routes have 
been disrupted (FEWS˙NET, August ˜˚˛˝), and the border 
temporarily closed (CILSS-CH, March ˜˚˛˝).

ACLED data shows that political violence Š around half of it 
against civilians Š rose at even higher rates in ˜˚˛˝ than in 
 especially in the eastern provinces of North Kivu, South 
Kivu and Ituri (ACLED, December ˜˚˛˝). The conˇict has taken 
on many forms in these areas including inter-ethnic and 
intercommunal conˇicts, and clashes between multiple armed 
groups that have attacked and obliterated villages, destroying 
ˆelds and harvests and stealing herds, thus reducing 
household food sources and incomes (FEWS˙NET, December 
˜˚˛˝). 
 ˛.˛˙million were 
forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods often during 
critical periods for transhumance and crop preparation (OCHA, 
˜˚˜˚). Arcent of the newly displaced IDPs were 
from North Kivu, ˘˛˙percent from South Kivu and ˜˜˙percent 
from Ituri (UNHCR, ˜˚˛˝). 
In the Kasais and Tanganyika, the scale of violence decreased, 
but the provinces still hosted a large number of IDPs. The 
Kasais also hosted a large number of returnees from Angola.
The number of cases of Ebola, which broke out in North Kivu 
and Ituri in  increased dramatically from March 
˜˚˛˝ as the response was severely hindered by armed groups. 
The outbreak disrupted agricultural activities and limited 
access to livelihoods (FEWS˙NET, April ˜˚˛˝). 
Weather extremes and crop pests 
Adequate, well-distributed precipitation during most of the 
year beneˆtted crops, except in the Bas and Haut-Uélé and 
western provinces. However, localized heavy rains, particularly 
in the agro-pastoral mountains of South Kivu, resulted in 
ˇooding and crop damage. Signiˆcant crop losses were also 
reported due to fall armyworm infestations, particularly 
in maize-growing regions (FAO-GIEWS, September ˜˚˛˝). 
Other pests reduced agricultural production in the Grand 
Katanga, Grand Kasai, the Ex-Oriental and Western provinces.

BACKGROUND
El Salvador is densely populated and suffers from persistent 
low levels of economic growth. However, it has experienced a 
moderate reduction in poverty (the poverty rate declined from 
˘˝˙per 
improvements in public services in recent years (WB, October 
˜˚˛˝). Its challenges include insufˆcient food production and 
high dependence on imports (WFP, November ˜˚˛˝). It is 
frequently exposed to natural hazards including earthquakes 
and volcanic eruptions. Its territory is entirely within the 
Dry Corridor, which is highly vulnerable to climate change 
impacts, including higher frequency of ˇoods, droughts 
and tropical storms (WB, October ˜˚˛˝). Recurrent droughts 
hamper progress in poverty and food insecurity alleviation. 
Around ˘˘˙percent of households live in multidimensional 
poverty and on avercent of expenditures to 
food (WFP, August ˜˚˛˝).
For the last ˘ve years smallholder farmer Cirilo Mendoza™s crops have been severely damaged by recurrent drought and he has been unable to ˘nd a job to 
support his wife and young child. He borrowed money to migrate to the US but was detained and deported home.

An estimated ˜˘˜˙˚˚˚ people faced Crisis or worse (IPC Phase

The majority of the population analysed were in IPC˙Phase˙˛

in Stressed (IPC˙Phase˙˜). At the sub-national level, the 
highest rates of acute food insecurity were assessed to reach

Lubombo regions (IPC, July ˜˚˛˝).
Compared to the previous year™s pech

of urgent humanitarian food assistance remained largely 
unchanged with a negligible improvement ofcent, as 
a second consecutive year of localized shortfalls in cereal

Food security conditions improved seasonally in mid-˜˚˛˝ 
straight after the ˜˚˛˝ harvest. From JuneŒSeptember ˜˚˛˝ 
arcent of the rural population) 
were in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase ˘ or above). 
 BACKGROUND 
Eswatini™s economy is closely tied to South Africa. Agriculture 
is the primary livelihood for the predominantly rural 
population (WB, ˜˚˛˝). However, amid low agricultural 
productivity, the country remains structurally deˆcit in key 
food staples (KoE, A high rate of poverty, 
, limits improvements 
in agricultural productivity and food security, with slow 
economic growth, high inequality, high HIV/AIDS prevalence 
and weather shocks being key factors inhibiting signiˆcant 
improvements in the population™s welfare (WB, ˜˚˛˝).
Eswatini is still recovering from the 2015/16 El Niño-induced drought, which dried up water sources and caused widespread crop failure and hunger. In 2019, 
rainfall de˘cits again caused shortfalls in food crop production. 
GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 
 |  91Nevertheless, crop failures and a consequent decrease in 
labour opportunities, combined with higher food prices, 
caused a worsening of acute food insecurity towards the end 
of the year (IPC, July ˜˚˛˝). 
FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYWeather extremes
Eswatini is still recovering fr
induced drought, which cost the country over SZL 
 As most of the food crop production is 
rain-fed and irrigation infrastructure remains unaffordable to 
smallholder farmers (KoE, the rainfall deˆcits 
during a critical cr 
cropping season caused localized shortfalls in food crop 
production in ˜˚˛˝, which underpinned the poor food security 
situation (FAO-GIEWS, October ˜˚˛˝).
Over one in four people reported having experienced a 
weather-related shock, such as drought, irregular rains or 
dry spells in ˜˚˛˝, rising to almost half of the population in 
Lubombo region (EVAC, July ˜˚˛˝).
The aggregate national cereal harvest in ˜˚˛˝ declined by 
cent compared to the previous year, with most 
crop failures concentrated in the eastern Lubombo and 
southern Shiselweni regions because of erratic rainfall. Cereal 
import requirements increased to ˜˚˚˙˚˚˚ tonnes which 
is slightly above the average (FAO-GIEWS, October ˜˚˛˝). 
Comparing households™ harvests in ˜˚˛˝ with the previous 
year,cent reported to have harvested half of 
the previous season and around ˝˙percent had no harvest or 
experienced total crop failure (EVAC, July ˜˚˛˝). 
Although the ˜˚˛˝ cereal harvest fostered a cyclical 
improvement in food security from JuneŒSeptember, 
reˇecting a boost in food stocks and a seasonal increase in 
income-generating opportunities, these improvements were 
short-lived. 
By October,cent of the rural population classiˆed 
as in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase ˘ or above) had depleted their 
food stocks earlier than normal and were engaged in crisis or 
emergency coping strategies, such as the sale of productive 
assets, to meet their essential food needs (IPC, July ˜˚˛˝). 
Economic shocks
In mid-˜˚˛˝, casual labour opportunities were limited and 
by June unemployment in Lubombo region had increased to 
˜˝˙percent and was expected to increase even further at the 
end of the year (IPC, July ˜˚˛˝). Nationally, unemployment

of households in most areas experienced a loss of income.

cent of households had depleted their food 
stocks within three months of harvest, and were reliant on 
markets for food, resorting to coping strategies when they 
were unable to afford to buy the food they needed (EVAC, July 
˜˚˛˝). The National Maize Corporation (NMC) kept prices of 
the main staple maize meal stable until mid-June when the 
retail price increased (FAO-GIEWS, October ˜˚˛˝). 
By October ˜˚˛˝, the national average maize meal price 
was ˛˛˙percent higher than its year-earlier level. Much of the 
price growth during ˜˚˛˝ was due to rising prices in South 
Africa, the country™s main supplier of grains (FAO-GIEWS, 
December ˜˚˛˝). However, market regulations, administered 
by the NMC, lessened the effects of imported inˇation and 
contributed to more stable domestic retail prices of maize 
meal (FAO-GIEWS, October ˜˚˛˝).
The situation in ˜˚˛˝ is aggravated by structural challenges 
and widespread poverty, with higher rates in rural areas, 
accentuated the impacts of weather shocks on food security in 
˜˚˛˝ (WB, ˜˚˛˝). 
Low incomes constrain access to farming inputs, while poor 
access to markets and agricultural-related information further 
impede improvements in agricultural productivity. The lack 
of competitive labour skills also limits households™ ability to 
ˆnd alternative employment when weather shocks minimize 
agricultural work opportunities (WB, ˜˚˛˛).

JuneŒSeptember Kiremt rains were up to ˘˚ percent above 
average and aggregate cereal production is estimated at 
above-average levels. However, unseasonal heavy rains 
during the October/November harvest resulted in localized 
crop production shortfalls (FAO-GIEWS, December ˜˚˛˝). 
Crops were attacked by desert locusts at the end of the year 
in northern and south-eastern Tigray, north-eastern Amhara 
and Eastern Oromiya regions. While coordinated control 
measures implemented by farmers, local communities and 
the Government have contained crop losses, substantial 
localized losses were reported in parts of Oromiya zone (FEWS

Households in pastoral and agroastoral areas of southern 
SNNP, southern and eastern Oromiya and southern Somali 
regions, faced an extended dry and hotter-than-average period 
through April ˜˚˛˝. The Gu/Genna˙(MarchŒMay) rains were

regions, most were in western and southern Oromia. Violence 
in Gambella affected local communities and refugees, while 
ethnic tensions in Amhara and areas bordering Benishangul 
Gumuz and Tigray displaced thousands. Many communities

.˜˙percent (Ministry of Finance and UNICEF, October ˜˚˛˝). 
Almost ˛˙million children have severe acute malnutrition 
annually (EmDHS, ˜˚˛˝). Malnutrition rates are highest in 
rural, hard-to-reach areas where people face difˆculties and/or 
discriminations in accessing health and nutrition services and 
among pastoralist populations (OCHA, January ˜˚˜˚).
Although stunting decreased signiˆcantly among children 
cent in ˜˚˛˝, it is 
still classiˆed as ‚very high™ (DHS, ˜˚˚˚Œ˜˚˛˝). In Afar, Amhara 
and Tigray regions stunting levels excent, and 
.˘ percent of children received a minimum acceptable 
diet (OCHA, January ˜˚˜˚). 
Food insecurity along with water shortages, poor sanitation 
facilities and lack of access to quality healthcare contributed 
to deteriorating child nutrition. Nationally sanitation coverage 
cent Œ in other words mor 
people lack access to improved sanitation (IFRC, July ˜˚˛˝). As 
of the outbreak 
in April ˜˚˛˝, cholera had been reported 
(ECDC, December ˜˚˛˝). There wer measles in 
Amhara, Afar, Oromiya and Somali and ˆve cases of vaccine-
derived polio reported in ˜˚˛˝ (WHO, December ˜˚˛˝). 
Nutrition status of refugees
Refugee nutrition was concerning in the ˜˛ camps assessed 
by the ˜˚˛˝ SENS: ˘˘˙percent of camps had GAM rates above 
the ‚very high™ threshold,cent had ‚high™ levels. 
cent of camps child anaemia levels were of 
‚high™ public health signiˆcance. Nursing mothers may stop 
breastfeeding due to psychological distress and insufˆcient 
access to food and water. Unsolicited donations of breast milk 
substitutes and milk products risked adequate young child

The situation was most critical for the rural population yet 
to recover frought in the six departments 
facing Crisis (IPC˙Phase˙˘) conditions, namely Alta Verapaz, 
Baja Verapaz, Quiché, Santa Rosa, Jalapa and Chiquimula 
(IPC, March ˜˚˛˝) and extended later in the year also to 
Suchitepéquez and Retalhuleu (IPC, December ˜˚˛˝). 
The lean season was expected to extend until August ˜˚˛˝. 
Due to high agricultural losses in the Primera season, 
subsistence farmers were particularly affected (IPC, March 
˜˚˛˝). By September, some areas in Huehuetenango, 
Retalhuleu, Totonicapán and Jutiapa were estimated to be in 
Crisis (IPC˙Phase˙˘) by the IPC-compatible analysis (FEWS˙NET,

The year ˜˚˛˝ marked the second consecutive year of

BACKGROUND
Guatemala has one of largest economies in Central America, 
but ar 
poverty, meaning they face deprivation in multiple aspects 
of their lives, including food security, nutrition, decent 
employment, health, housing and education (MPPN, 
November ˜˚˛˝). 
It is also one of the most socially unequal societies with 
indigenous peoples particularly disadvantaged (ACAPS, 
November ˜˚˛˝). Social inequality is aggravated by the 
country™s high vulnerability to climate change. Over the past 
three years, extended dry seasons have had a severe impact 
on the livelihoods of subsistence farmers, who rely on rain-fed 
agriculture, especially in the Dry Corridor (WFP, accessed 
January ˜˚˜˚).

had negative impacts at the national level. The most affected 
northern departments of Alta Verapaz, Petén and Quiché, 
cent of the main season output, 
received rainfall that was ˜˚Œ˘˚˙percent below average 
(FAO
-GIEWS, November ˜˚˛˝).
By September, El Progreso, Jutiapa, Zacapa, Chiquimula, 
Baja Verapaz and Quiché departments of the Dry Corridor 
were affected by irregular rains, late onset of rains and high 
temperatures, which rcent losses of the 
Primera harvest (FEWS˙NET, August ˜˚˛˝). In central and 
eastern parts, subsistence farmers™ yields wercent 
below average, while some larger producers in Quiché 
and Retalhuleu departments reported arcent 
reductions (GEOGLAM, October ˜˚˛˝).
Improvement in rainfall from mid-September was promising 
for the Postrera maize and bean harvests, which account for 
˜˚˙percent of the annual production (FAO
-GIEWS, November 
˜˚˛˝) but JuneŒAugust irregular rainfall and excess humidity 
in October resulted in low yields in Güija and Chortí micro-
regions (IPC, December ˜˚˛˝). Thus, below-average overall 
aggregate maize production was anticipated for ˜˚˛˝ 
(FAO
-GIEWS, November ˜˚˛˝). 
Heavy rains in September caused ˇooding and landslides, 
and led to localized crop damages in Chiquimula, Escuintla, 
Jutiapa, Quetzaltenango and Retalhuleu departments 
(FEWS˙NET, October ˜˚˛˝). By November, almost ˛.˘˙million 
people nationwide had been affected by the rains with 
reported injuries, evacuations and damages to infrastructure 
(CONRED, November ˜˚˛˝). 
In the ˆrst half of ˜˚˛˝, around ˛˜˙˚˚˚ people were newly 
displaced by disasters. Between May and November excessive 
rains were r 
many of them in need of shelter and food assistance (IDMC, 
January ˜˚˜˚). 
Economic shocks
The poorest families in the Dry Corridor areas faced low 
incomes during AprilŒMay (FEWS˙NET, April ˜˚˛˝), and the 
situation remained the same towards the end of the year 
for subsistence farming families who had lost their Primera 
harvest. Their dependency on markets increased, they had to 
adopt consumption-based coping strategies and to consider 
atypical migration patterns (FEWS˙NET, October ˜˚˛˝; IPC, 
December ˜˚˛˝). In March, the minimum wage covered 
cent of a basic food basket while staple food 
prices remained more or less stable (FEWS˙NET, April ˜˚˛˝). 
Maize prices peaked during JuneŒJuly before dropping to 
earlier levels by October, reˇecting the seasonal pattern. The 
price of black beans however increased slightly from August 
(FAO
-GIEWS, November ˜˚˛˝).

increased and negatively affected production (FEWS˙NET,

(FEWS˙NET, October ˜˚˛˝). 
InsecurityFrom JanuaryŒMay ˜˚˛˝, an average of ˛˘ murders per day 
were recorded and gang-related violence is high. Overall, 
violence creates signiˆcant protection issues, especially for 
women, and poses a major constraint for humanitarian access 
(REDLAC, April ˜˚˛˝). The levels of violence, deˆcits of basic 
services and poverty continued to cause large groups to 
migrate to the United States or Mexico, although new border 
security measures and increasingly hostile immigration and 
asylum-seeking legislation and policies were of high concern 
for all Central American migrants (ACAPS, December ˜˚˛˝). 
Insecurity and eviction of indigenous communities associated 
with large-scale business activities also drove internal 
displacement (IACHR,

While acute malnutrition prevalence was very low (below

The Ministry of Health reported an increase in acute 
malnutrition from MarchŒAugust of ˜˚˛˝ compared to the 
 ˜˚˜˚). Coverage of health services 
is poor and unequal, and is one of the biggest challenges

October ˜˚˛˝ (PAHO WHO, ˜˚˛˝). In addition, an increase in 
diarrhoeal diseases likely due to drinking untreated water also 
affected the population (IPC, December ˜˚˛˝). 
General immediate causes of malnutrition include inadequate

BACKGROUND
During recent years Honduras has registered the second 
highest economic growth rates in Central America, only 
behind Panama (WB, October ˜˚˛˝). Despite an improvement 
in economic output and decrease in public debt in recent 
years, high levels of poverty exist and inequality is among 
the highest in the region and the world. While the poverty 
rate fell˙from ar 
, the extreme poverty rcent, the 
highest rate in Latin American countries after Haiti (WB, 
October ˜˚˛˝). It is vastly exposed to natural adverse events 
and climate change, especially heavy and irregular rainfall 
and long periods of drought in the southern and western 
regions of the country, known as the Dry Corridor, leading to 
major crop losses that disproportionately affect the poor (WB, 
October ˜˚˛˝). 
In the face of high levels of poverty and inequality as well as increasing climate shocks, inequitable access to land, insuf˘cient food production and high 
unemployment, subsistence farming families work hard to diversify their sources of income.

FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYWeather extremes
In August, the government declared a national state of 
emergency over drought, and the particular need to provide 
support to communities in approximately ˛˚˚ municipalities 
in the central, eastern and southern parts of the country 
(FEWS˙NET, October ˜˚˛˝). 
Rainfall amounts during JuneŒAugust were more than

Inadequate evidenceNot analysed108  | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020
High temperatures and dry conditions also induced forest ˆres 
and pest outbreaks, further affecting crop production. During 
October, heavy rainfall triggered ˇooding and landslides 
in western Honduras, af destroying ˛˚˚ 
houses and damaging several roads (ECHO, October ˜˚˛˝).
Poor soil conditions, over exploitation of forest resources, 
degraded lands, small plots and lack of access to credit, 
agricultural supplies and technical assistance drive 
agricultural productivity and proˆtability further down (WFP, 
January ˜˚˜˚).
Economic shocks
Vulnerable subsistence farming families, who lost their 
primera harvest crops, needed a regular income to buy their 
food supplies in markets, but employment opportunities were 
scarce and income not sufˆcient, so they were likely to resort 
to coping strategies, such as money or grain borrowing and 
migration to urban areas (FEWS˙NET, October ˜˚˛˝). 
For instance, many poor households depend on work as small 
producers and/or cutters in the coffee industry. But the ˜˚˛˝ 
decline in international coffee prices hit coffee growers in 
western Honduras hard and depressed the demand for wage 
labourers (IPC, December ˜˚˛˝). 
Domestic prices of white maize increased from the beginning 
of ˜˚˛˝ to September when they started to decline with the 
commercialization of supplies from the main season harvests. 
Prices of red beans were on the rise since May˙˜˚˛˝, following 
seasonal trends. In September˙˜˚˛˝, they were higher than 
a year earlier, reˇecting reduced minor season outputs 
(FAO
-GIEWS, October ˜˚˛˝).
InsecurityCriminal actors generate widespread human rights violations 
(threats and intimidation, homicides, extortion, trafˆcking, 
kidnappings, child recruitment and sexual and gender-based 
violence). Recent human rights reports show that the current 
fear and insecurity among the civilian population can be 
compared with that experienced in armed conˇicts (NRC, June 
˜˚˛˝). 
Despite a downward trend in recent years, the country™s 
murder rate continues to be among the highest in the 
world (HRW, January ˜˚˜˚). Civil riots and protests lead to 
confrontations between military forces and civilians (UN, June 
˜˚˛˝). 
Gang-related violence, poverty and lack of education 
opportunities are causing thousands of children and families 
to ˇee their homes. Without access to protection and safe 
migration pathways, most are forced onto dangerous routes 
where they are at risk from violence, exploitation and abuse 
(UNICEF, April ˜˚˛˝).

FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYConˇict/insecurity
The security situation in Iraq remained unpredictable in 
˜˚˛˝. The lack of civil and security control in disputed areas 
continued to enable non-state actors, including ISIL, to mount 
small-scale attacks almost weekly in certain governorates. Anti-
government demonstrations against corruption, lack of basic 
services and high unemployment started in Baghdad and 
Shiite areas in October and later spread to other governorates 
BACKGROUND
December ˜˚˛˝ marked two years since Iraq™s military 
operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant 
(ISIL) ended. During ISIL™ 
were displaced, infrastructure and livelihoods were destroyed, 
social cohesion eroded and basic services disrupted. The 
country still faces social, ethnic and sectarian tensions as 
well as political uncertainty and violence. Iraq is an anomaly 
of an upper middle-income country at 'very high risk' of a 
humanitarian crisis requiring international assistance (OCHA, 
November ˜˚˛˝).ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY 
OVERVIEW
Out of˛˙million people in Iraq in need of humanitarian 
assistance, about ˛.e in acute need of support, 
including food and livelihoods assistance. Mor 
of them are children. Half of those in urgent need are 
concentrated in only two governorates Š Ninewa and Al-Anbar 
Š which host high numbers of returnees. Diyala, Salah Al-Din

protests had escalated and the prime minister had resigned 
and by December, arCLED, 
December ˜˚˛˝). 
The protests and uncertain security affected humanitarian 
operations. Intermittent curfews were imposed in Baghdad 
and the southern governorates, resulting in missions being 
delayed or cancelled. In Ninewa UN agencies and NGOs were 
unable to carry out relief activities in camps because of delays 
in getting approvals and access letters (OCHA, November 
˜˚˛˝). 
By October, there wers acros 
governorates (IOM, November ˜˚˛˝). Out of ˛.˜˙million people 
displaced outside of camps, more than two-thirds had not 
returned to their areas of origin for over three years (OCHA, 
November ˜˚˛˝). The remaining IDPs in camps include people 
who are not welcome to return due to unproven afˆliations 
to extremist groups Œ they often face challenges in accessing 
assistance (ACAPS, October ˜˚˛˝). 
However,s have r 
across eight governorates, usually to experience severe 
hardship (IOM, November ˜˚˛˝). Considerable secondary 
displacement has resulted from forced and premature returns 
and forced or coerced departures from camps and informal 
settlements in Ninewa, Salah Al-Din, Al-Anbar, Kirkuk and 
Diyala governorates (OCHA, November ˜˚˛˝).
In August, the Government of Iraq consolidated and closed 
several IDP camps with the aim of all displaced people 
returning home by the end of ˜˚˜˚. Between August and 
October, on average ˜˜˜ households left camps every day, 
many moving to non-camp settings, but ˘˙˘˚˚ families 
transferred to other camps (IOM, October ˜˚˛˝). Many IDPs 
in out-of-camp locations are cut off from assistance (HNO, 
November ˜˚˛˝). 
In October ˜˚˛˝, a military offensive by Turkey against Kurdish 
forces in north-east Syria compounded existing insecurity and 
uncertainty on Iraq™s western border (OCHA, November ˜˚˛˝). 
Around ˛˝˙˚˚˚ Syrians crossed the border to Iraq between 
mid-October and December ˜˚˛˝ (IOM, January ˜˚˜˚).
Insecurity and displacement continued to constrain farmers™ 
access to agricultural lands, while agricultural inputs 
and machinery remained expensive and in short supply 
(FAO
-GIEWS, April ˜˚˛˝), worsening medium-term food 
security prospects. Even though the agricultural sector is small, 
it still plays a role in Iraq™s economy (FAO, January ˜˚˜˚). 
Economic shocks
Iraq™s economy is slowly recovering, with GDP expected 
to grcent in ˜˚˛˝ mainly due to higher oil prices 
and better security (WB, October ˜˚˛˝). But progress on 
reconstruction and development is slow and much of the 
infrastructure damaged or destroyed (OCHA, November ˜˚˛˝).

At necent, the labour force participation rate 
is one of the lowest in the world, especially for women 
(˛˜˙perarcent). The 
unemployment rate has increased beyond the ˜˚˛˜ level to 
˝.˝˙per but was nearly ˜˛˙percent for women. 
Underutilization is particularly high among IDPs, with almost 
cent unemployed or underemployed (WB, April ˜˚˛˝). 
The poor performance of the agricultural sector and lack 
of rural employment have driven migration to urban areas 
where people face poor public service delivery and increasing 
poverty (FAO, January ˜˚˜˚).
Even though physical market access for IDPs and returnees 
was good, they were often unable to buy essential goods 
because their monthly income was lower than the basic needs 
threshold (MCNA, December ˜˚˛˝). Based on WFP price data, 
cereal prices remained stable during ˜˚˛˝ except for rice, 
which peaked in March before dropping. Bread prices peaked 
in August (WFP, December ˜˚˛˝). 
Weather extremes
Heavy rains during March/April caused ˇooding in several 
governorates with Salah al-Din, Bara and Missan the worst 
affected. Floods caused temporary displacement and 
disrupted clean water supplies in some areas (OCHA, May

The MarchŒApril ‚long rains™ were generally very poor. In 
south-eastern and coastal marginal agriculture livelihood 
zones maize prcent 
below average, with near failure of the harvest reported in 
several south-eastern areas (FAO-GIEWS, September ˜˚˛˝). 
However, in the Rift Valley and Western provinces improved 
rains from May resulted in average maize production 
 (FAO-GIEWS, December ˜˚˛˝). Drought conditions in March 
and April in northern pastoral areas and prevailing moisture 
deˆcits resulted in poor livestock conditions and limited milk 
production, atypical migration patterns and competition over 
natural resources (FAO-GIEWS, June ˜˚˛˝).  
Exceptionally abundant OctoberŒDecember ‚short-rains™ 
beneˆtted yields and induced farmers to increase areas 
planted, resulting in an estimated above-average cereal 
production (FAO-GIEWS, March ˜˚˜˚). These rains regenerated 
pasture and rangelands and improved livestock body 
conditions, allowing many to recover fr 
drought (FEWS NET, ˜˚˛˝). 
However, these rains also caused devastating ˇash ˇoods and 
landslides disrupted livelihoods, destroyed crops and swept 
away livestock, irrigation systems, roads, houses, health clinics 
and sanitation services, mainly in north-eastern, central and 
coastal regions.e 
af November ˜˚˛˝). 
Conˇict/insecurity 
Deteriorated forage and water resources during the ˆrst 
half of ˜˚˛˝ led to atypical livestock migration resulting in 
increased resource-based conˇicts over grazing rights and 
access to water resources in Meru North, Kitui, Samburu, 
Turkana, West Pokot, Marsabit, Tana River, Garissa, Isiolo and 
Nyeri counties. This subsided with the OctoberŒDecember 
rains when livestock returned to their traditional grazing 
lands (FEWS˙NET, August ˜˚˛˝). Periodic cattle rustling led 
to increased tensions, loss of livestock and limited access to 
markets. Sporadic terrorist attacks against civilians and state 
security forces by Al˙Shabaab affected trade and commodity 
movements in counties bordering Somalia (RoK, ˜˚˛˝).
Economic shocks
Maize prices, mostly stable at low levels in the ˆrst quarter of

supported by crop production shortfalls, lower imports from 
Uganda and disruptions to transport infrastructure. A poor 
harvest due to heavy rainfall contributed to sustain the high 
level of prices, although the Government™s stock release 
prevented further spikes (FAO-GIEWS, February ˜˚˜˚). 
Livestock prices increased in late ˜˚˛˝ as animal body 
conditions improved, and in most pastoral key reference

following a scale-down of integrated outreaches in some

FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYWeather extremes
Rainfall deˆcits had a negative impact on rice and maize 
cr eastern and extreme 
southern parts (FAO-GIEWS, January ˜˚˛˝). Western areas 
faced a decrease in local rice production because of well 
below-average rains, while in southern areas maize production 
was near zero following unevenly distributed rainfall, pest 
outbreaks and high costs of seeds (FEWS˙NET, April ˜˚˛˝). 
Cyclones Desmond and Ekestang in early ˜˚˛˝ ˇooded maize 
and rice ˆelds in south-western and middle-western areas 
(FEWS˙NET, January ˜˚˛˝), and cyclone Gelena brought above-
average rainfalls in northern areas (FEWS˙NET, February ˜˚˛˝). 
Overall, the ˜˚˛˝ cereal production increased compared to 
the previous year and to the ˆve-year average, with signiˆcant 
increases in rice production, 
levels and cassava production, which was ˛˜˙percent above. 
However, signiˆcant production shortfalls were reported 
locally, such as in the Grand Sud where the region of Androy 
has experienced a signiˆcant drop in rice production over 
the past six years. In these areas, despite favourable rainfall 
compared to the previous year, agricultural production 
remained constrained by the lack of inputs resulting from 
previous failed agricultural campaigns (MAEP, FAO and WFP,

maize production being ˘˚˙percent below the ˆve-year 
average, including signiˆcant shortfalls in the southern and 
south-western areas (FEWS˙NET, October ˜˚˛˝). According to 
FAO estimates, the outbreak infested half of maize crops (FAO, 
December ˜˚˛˝), which discouraged farmers from planting 
(FAO-GIEWS, November ˜˚˛˝). Locust infestations affected 
rice and pulse crops in southern and central-southern areas 
(FEWS˙NET, July ˜˚˛˝), although to a lesser extent than in the 
previous decade.
Economic shocks
By January, households were highly dependent on markets 
during the lean season because ofeal output 
and early depletion of food stocks (FEWS˙NET, March ˜˚˛˝), 
particularly in the southern and south-eastern areas. Heavy 
rains following the cyclones affected supply routes to southern 
markets (FEWS˙NET, January ˜˚˛˝) where around four in 
ˆve communes faced shortages of cassava. Rice prices were 
cent above their year-earlier levels, maize prices were 
˘˝˙percent higher, and cascent higher. Daily wages 
were low and decreasing due to a limited demand for labour. 
Four in ˆve vulnerable households in the south, and two in 
three in the south-east had to reduce their number of daily 
meals as a coping strategy until AprilŒMay (SISAV, February 
and April ˜˚˛˝). 
In the post-harvest period in JulyŒAugust, rice prices were still 
˛˚˙percent above their year-earlier levels in Grand Sud (SISAV, 
August ˜˚˛˝). The lean season started earlier than usual Œ in 
October instead of December Œ because of reduced production 
in these areas and early depletion of households™ stocks 
(FEWS˙NET, September ˜˚˛˝). 
More generally, a structural issue continued to constrain 
food security in ˜˚˛˝, as rice production was curtailed by 
lack of access to inputs and poor irrigation infrastructures 
(FAO-GIEWS, June ˜˚˛˝). For instance, poor southern farmers 
cropped only half of agricultural land in early ˜˚˛˝ because 
they could not afford to buy seeds and cuttings (FEWS˙NET, 
February ˜˚˛˝). Despite the rebound in rice production in 
˜˚˛˝, a signiˆcant cereal deˆcit remained and cereal import 
requirements for ˜˚˛˝/˜˚˜˚ were for 
tonnes (FAO-GIEWS, November ˜˚˛˝). However, high prices of 
local and imported products affected households™ purchasing 
power due to the ˛˚˙percent depreciation of the local currency 
against the USD (FEWS˙NET, June ˜˚˛˝).

BACKGROUND
Approcent of Malawians are engaged in 
predominantly rainfed agriculture, making food security, 
employment and the economy highly sensitive to weather 
extremes (prolonged dry spells, extremely high temperatures, 
drought, cyclones, ˇoods and landslides). The effects of 
climate shocks are further exacerbated by an estimated 
national poverty rate ofcent, with a higher prevalence 
in the southern region (NSO, January ˜˚˛˝).

In Malawi many structural issues, including insecure land tenure, lack of irrigation, low access to farm inputs, declines in soil fertility and dominance of 
maize, which is a thirsty crop, keep yields low and make smallholders extremely vulnerable to adverse weather events.

FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYWeather extremes
Well below-average cereal pr 
as a result of unfavourable rains in the central and southern 
regions (maize production fell by ˜˚˙percent compared 
 and consequently low household-level food 
stocks, increased households™ reliance on markets to meet 
consumption needs until the harvest in the second quarter of 
˜˚˛˝ (FAO-GIEWS,
In early March ˜˚˛˝, cyclone Idai caused severe ˇooding, crop 
losses, damage and destruction of 
southern Malawi, affecting more than ˝˜˜˙˚˚˚ people, with 
ed (OCHA, February ˜˚˛˝). Widespread 
losses of food supplies, damage to standing crops and 
reduced access to markets aggravated acute food insecurity 
(IFPRI, March ˜˚˛˝).
From mid-˜˚˛˝, food security improved due to increased 
cereal production in central and northern districts thanks to 
beneˆcial seasonal rains. Improved household food supplies 
and income-generating opportunities from crop sales 
lessened the need for humanitarian food assistance. In the 
southern region prolonged periods of dry weather and the 
impact of Cyclone Idai caused shortfalls in cereal production 
that sustained high levels of acute food insecurity.
Economic shocks
Prices of maize, the country™s key food staple, increased 
throughout ˜˚˛˝, only punctured by a brief seasonal decline 
between March and May, before reaching record highs near 
the end of the year. The early ˜˚˛˝ rise was mostly driven 
by domestic supply pressure, and while the larger harvest 
helped to alleviate this pressure in the immediate period 
following the AprilŒJune harvest, it was subsequently offset by 
heightened demand from importing countries across the sub-
region (Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia) leading to further 
price gains. 
Institutional purchases, as the country sought to shore up 
the national strategic reserves, an upward revision to the 
farm gate price and a rise in petrol prices, combined to push 
up maize prices further at the end of the year (FAO-GIEWS, 
December ˜˚˛˝). 
Purchasing power is also constrained by lack of income. Over 
cent of all older youth and adults work in agriculture, 
but over a third of the working-age population is economically 
inactive, women and urban 
dwellers (IFPRI, May ˜˚˛˝). 
Most of Malawi™efugees and asylum seekers from 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Rwanda 
live in the heavily congested Dzaleka Refugee Camp near the

ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY 
OVERVIEW
Between October and December ˜˚˛˝, ar 
people were in Crisis or worse (CH˙Phase˙˘ or above), 
including ˘˝˙˚˚˚ people in Emer Three 
out of four of these people Œ including all populations 
classiˆed in Emere in the northern 
regions of Timbuktu, Kidal and Gao. In addition, ˜.˝˙million 
were facing Stressed (CH˙Phase˙˜) conditions and at risk 
of slipping into Crisis (CH˙Phase˙˘) were they to face an 
additional shock or stressor. Three areas were classiˆed in 
Crisis (CH˙Phase˙˘) in Gao and Timbuktu,e in 
Stressed (CH˙Phase˙˜), mainly in Timbuktu, Gao, Kidal, Mopti 
and Kayes (CILSS-CH, ˜˚˛˝).
The number of food-insecure people continued increasing 
throughout ˜˚˛˝, rising fr 
or worse (CH˙Phase˙˘ or above) in Mar 
JuneŒAugust. The number of people in Stressed (CH˙Phase˙˜) 
also increased overall, from archŒMay 
to ˘.˜˙million in JuneŒAugust (CILSS-CH, ˜˚˛˝). The central 
and northern regions were consistently the most affected.
FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYConˇict/insecurity
Increasing insecurity was characterized by cattle raids, 
destruction of food stocks and abandonment of pastures, 
markets, villages and ˆelds in the regions of Mopti, Timbuktu, 
Gao and Ségou. Despite above-average ˜˚˛˝ cereal production 
prospects, there were localized shortfalls in Kayes and Mopti. 
Pastoralists in these areas faced insecurity and limited access 
to pastures, particularly during the pastoral lean season 
from AprilŒJuly (FEWS˙NET, May ˜˚˛˝). As a result, unusual 
movements of herds were reported in the centre and north 
and in neighbouring countries Œ Mauritania, Burkina Faso, 
the Niger and Côte d™Ivoire Œ as well as cattle raids and thefts 
(Ministry of Agriculture, November ˜˚˛˝). Most economic 
activities, including ˆshing, were affected by insecurity in the 
inner delta of the Niger River (FEWS˙NET, October ˜˚˛˝).
As of late November, around ˛˝˝˙˚˚˚ people were internally 
displaced, which reprcent increase since 
early March ˜˚˛˝, mostly due to violence in Mopti, Gao and 
Ménaka, and in the bordering areas between Mali and Burkina 
Faso. In addition, the country hosted arefugees 
mostly from Mauritania, Burkina Faso and the Niger. Around

Weather extremes
Mali experienced generally favourable harvests except in 
 areas such as western˙Sahel, and northern and central parts 
 of the country that were affected by inadequate rainfall 
 and/or insecurity. (FAO, December ˜˚˛˝). Although slightly 
 overall, cereal prcent 
above the ˆve-year average (FEWS˙NET, October ˜˚˛˝). 
Prolonged dry spells were reported in early June and in 
late September, which led to a reduction in maize planting 
(FEWS˙NET, August ˜˚˛˝). 
Localized vegetation stress was detrimental to pastoralist 
households in western Sahel areas of Kayes, in the north 
and centre-south of Timbuktu, and localized areas in Gao 
and Kidal. Floods affected around ˝˚˙˚˚˚ people from 
JuneŒOctober mostly in the regions of Mopti, Timbuktu, 
Segou, Koulikoro and Bamako (Ministry of Agriculture, 
September ˜˚˛˝) and lowered crop production, particularly 
in rice-growing areas of the Niger River valley. Flooding also 
hampered transhumance, leading to livestock concentrations 
in certain areas (FAO, December ˜˚˛˝). 
Economic shocks
Insecurity curtailed trade ˇows as traders were not able to 
access livestock and cereal markets in the north, in the areas 
bordering Burkina Faso and in the Niger Delta. Pasture deˆcits 
in western Sahel along with the disruptions to movement in 
conˇict-affected areas, were likely to negatively affect livestock 
feeding conditions and pastoral households™ incomes (FAO, 
December ˜˚˛˝).As of February, insecurity, intercommunal conˇicts and border 
closures disrupted trade ˇows between Mali and Algeria, 
Senegal, Benin and Guinea. As a result, in early ˜˚˛˝ prices 
were above their year-earlier levels in Western Sahel areas of 
Kayes (OMA et al, February ˜˚˛˝), as well as in Kidal, Ménaka 
and Mopti (WFP,˙March ˜˚˛˝). Seven markets Œ in Timbuktu, 
Gao, Mopti, Ségou, Kayes and Sikasso Œ were in Crisis because 
of elevated price levels and one was in Alert as of April (WFP, 
April ˜˚˛˝). 
Households depleted their stocks earlier than usual in the 
Niger River valley in Gao and Timbuktu, and in some areas 
of the Niger River inner delta, and had to resort to negative 
coping strategies, such as buying food on credit, selling 
productive assets, begging or migrating Œ in a context of 
insecurity and disrupted livelihoods (FEWS˙NET, October ˜˚˛˝). 
In the regions of Gao and Mopti, livestock exports decreased 
signiˆcantly due to insecurity, which limited traders™ physical 
access to markets (FEWS˙NET, June ˜˚˛˝). In October, terms 
of trade were favourable to livestock owners overall, except 
in Gao, Ménaka and in some areas of Timbuktu (Ministry of 
Agriculture, November ˜˚˛˝).

˜˚˛˝). 
Mozambique was hit by two consecutive tropical cyclones in 
March and April ˜˚˛˝, killing at le injuring 
neaving an estimated ˜.˜˙million in need of 
humanitarian assistance and protection. Cyclone Idai made 
landfall in March ˜˚˛˝, bringing strong winds and torrential 
rains to Sofala, Zambezia, Tete and Manica provinces and 
Cyclone Kenneth struck the northern provinces of Cabo 
Delgado and Nampula six weeks later (HRP, ˜˚˛˝). 
In the affected areas, where morcent of people 
are dependent on agriculture as their primary source of 
income, smallholders suffered major agricultural losses 
during the critical harvest period following an already-difˆcult 
lean season. They suffered destruction of infrastructure, assets 
and livelihoods. es of crops were 
destroyed following Cyclone Idai™s landfall (FAO, September 
˜˚˛˝), while nees were affected by Cyclone 
Kenneth (OCHA, May ˜˚˛˝). 
Farmers in Manica and Sofala Š the two provinces hardest 
hit by Cyclone Idai and the subsequent catastrophic ˇooding 
Š produce approcent of the national cereal 
output,cent in 
Sofala reported harvesting less than half of their maize (OCHA, 
May ˜˚˛˝). Affected households reported having well below-
average food stocks, leaving many vulnerable households 
without the prospect of another full harvest until March ˜˚˜˚ 
(FAO/WFP, September ˜˚˛˝). 
Following two consecutive years of below-average production 
in southern semi-arid areas, most poor households were 
unable to keep some of their harvested grain to be used as 
seeds for ˜˚˛˝. The devastating ˇoods caused by Cyclone 
Idai in the central region again reduced households™ ability 
to retain seeds for the current season and increased their 
dependence on borrowing or humanitarian assistance 
(FEWS˙NET, December ˜˚˛˝). These repeated extremes alter 
households™ recovery capacities and undermine resilience.

Widespread fall armyworm outbreaks adversely affected 
crop yields, particularly maize crops. Dry weather conditions 
in some southern and central areas, prior to the cyclones, 
facilitated the spread of the pest, increasing its damage and 
impact on crop productivity. 
As a result of the sharp decline in maize production and 
decrease in paddy output, ˜˚˛˝ cereal production was 
cent lower than 
 but still above the previous ˆve-year average. Production 
of sorghum and millet was estimated at an above-average 
level thanks to the crops™ greater resilience to water stress and 
the fact that they are normally planted in higher altitude areas 
that are less affected by ˇooding (FAO/WFP, September ˜˚˛˝).
Economic shocks 
Economic growth in ˜˚˛˝ slowed due to the losses suffered in 
the agricultural sector, as well as the disruptive consequences 
of the cyclones on other sectors, such as transport, housing, 
industry and commerce, and energy (Government of 
Mozambique, May ˜˚˛˝). 
Due to the impact of climate extremes on agricultural 
production and to higher year-on-year prices of maize grains 
in South Africa, a key supplier of maize for southern provinces 
of Mozambique, prices of white maize grain continued to rise 
in October and wercent above their year-earlier 
levels (FAO
-GIEWS, December ˜˚˛˝). The abnormally high 
prices of staple maize grain were expected to further constrain 
the purchasing power of poor households. By October, they 
were relying heavily on market purchase for food (FEWS˙NET, 
November ˜˚˛˝).Conˇict/insecurity 
The government is grappling with a low-level so-called Islamic 
insurgency in parts of the gas-rich northern province of Cabo 
Delgado (WB, September ˜˚˛˝). Armed violence with attacks 
on civilians continued to force people to abandon their homes, 
crops, livelihoods and assets. Villages and health centres have 
been destroyed. 
Recurr, the violence has prevented 
humanitarian organizations from reaching those in need and 
local populations from accessing basic services, with displaced 
people and host communities particularly vulnerable. Having 
lost their harvest to Cyclone Kenneth, people increasingly 
turned to charcoal production for income because they feared 
being attacked if they ventured in their ˆelds to plant crops 
outside Macomia town (ICRC, December ˜˚˛˝). 
Results from the annual food security and nutrition analysis 
(SETSAN) prior to Cyclone Kenneth already showed a 
concerning food security and nutrition situation in ˆve districts 
in the north of Cabo Delgado province linked to conˇict and 
violence. Two of the districts (Macomia and Quissanga) were 
hardest hit by Cyclone Kenneth (OCHA, May ˜˚˛˝).

Generally, acute malnutrition increased in all analysed 
districts, particularly those affected by Cyclone Idai and ˇoods 
(IPC, July ˜˚˛˝). However, the IPC analyses were conducted 
before Cyclone Kenneth hit Cabo Delgado. The cyclone was 
likely to reduce the quality and quantity of infant feeding, 
further increase the occurrence of diarrhoea and malaria, and 
lower coverage of health and sanitation services and access to 
safe water sources (OCHA, May ˜˚˛˝).

Acute food insecurity among refugees
According to UNHCR, as of ˘˛ October ˜˚˛˝, the Niger hosted 
efugees, mostly from Nigeria and Mali. This included 
 living in three

 who arrived since ˜˚˛˜, living in four camps 
and among host communities in Tillabéri and Tahoua. Around 
 the Nigerian refugees arrived recently, living along 
the border area in Maradi. 
Refugees and host communities face factors that erode food 
security, such as demographic pressure (including high 
fertility rates), limited agricultural resources and deteriorating 
security, which limits already scarce economic opportunities. 
Refugees especially have trouble accessing fertile land.

April and May ˜˚˛˝, the security environment deteriorated 
in border areas with Burkina Faso (OCHA, May ˜˚˛˝). In 
conˇict-affected areas of Diffa, Liptako Gourma, north Tahoua 
and to a certain extent south Maradi, crop production, trade, 
markets and livestock mobility were severely disrupted, 
decreasing food availability (FEWS˙NET, December ˜˚˛˝). 
By the end of ˜˚˛˝, there were ˛˚˝˙˚˚˚ IDPs in the Diffa 
rs in host households in Tahoua 
and Tillabéri (UNHCR, December ˜˚˛˝) who had lost their 
livelihoods. In Tahoua and Tillabéri, community solidarity

displaced persons, signiˆcantly reducing the quantities 
consumed in host households (FEWS˙NET, December ˜˚˛˝).

There werefugees in Dif

and Sokoto states in Nigeria (UNHCR, December ˜˚˛˝).
Weather extremes
Generally, the growing season had medium to good rainfall. 
However, households in Tillabéri, Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder 
regions faced cereal deˆcits caused by rainfall irregularities, 
pests and ˇoods, in addition to conˇict and displacement. This 
resulted in a gradual dwindling of cereal stocks and an early 
reliance on markets (FEWS˙NET, December ˜˚˛˝).
Floods caused by heavy seasonal rains, which began in June, 
affected over ˜˛˛˙˚˚˚ people, destroying crops and livestock. 
In the last week of August, water levels of the Niger basin 
reached their highest levels since ˜˚˛˜ and overˇow from 
dams in Burkina Faso and Mali contributed to the surging 
waters. The hardest hit regions were Zinder, Maradi and 
Agadez (OCHA, September ˜˚˛˝). In the Diffa region, heavy 
ˇoods in October on irrigated pepper and rice crops damaged 
livelihoods and food availability. 
In pastoral areas, drought led to a sharp decline in the 
availability of pasture, which signiˆcantly reduced the 
purchasing power of livestock farming households (FEWS˙NET, 
December ˜˚˛˝). The production of biomass (deˆned as

(IPC˙Phase ˜). Out of 
other regions, two wer ˛˝˙in Serious 
(IPC˙Phase ˘) and ˛˘ in Alert (IPC Phase ˜).
The major contributing factors to acute malnutrition varied 
from one unit of analysis to the other. Insecurity in the regions 
of Diffa, Tillabéri, Tahoua and Maradi was likely to have 
affected the nutritional status of children. Household acute 
food insecurity appeared to be a minor contributing factor in 
most of the areas analysed. 
This grave malnutrition situation can be largely attributed to 
child feeding practices. Just ˜˛.˛˙percent of children under 
six months were exclusively brecent of

BACKGROUND 
Persistent insecurity due to the ˛˚
-year
-old Boko Haram 
insurgency is causing continuing misery and dangers for 
millions living in northern states. The situation appears to 
be getting worse as Islamic extremist groups grow stronger 
across the region (FEWS˙NET, February ˜˚˜˚). Climate change 
and a growing population is putting pressure on land, 
with growing tensions and violence between pastoralists 
and farmers leading to a lack of investment and failure to 
maximize the country™s vast agricultural potential. Levels of 
poverty, especially in the north, remain stubbornly high, with 
half the people in Africa™s most populous country estimated to 
be living on less than USD˛.˝˚/day (WB, April ˜˚˛˝).

FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYConˇict/insecurity
Although conˇict occurred in fewer areas compared to 
previous years, north
-eastern Nigeria saw an intensiˆcation 
of armed violence in ˜˚˛˝, especially in Borno state. By the 
end of the year there wers 
in the region, the highest number since  with 
˝˜˙percent of them displaced by the insurcent 
by climate events (UNHCR, accesJanuary ˜˚˛˝). 
Despite IDPs™ high dependence on humanitarian aid (CILSS-
CH ˜˚˛˝), humanitarian access to Boko Haram-affected areas 
was constrained by the volatile security situation, restrictions 
on movement and poor road infrastructure (ACAPS, October 
˜˚˛˝).
-east Nigeria could not 
be reached with aid as of January, and this number likely 
increased throughout the year (REACH ˜˚˛˝; FEWS˙NET, ˜˚˛˝).
With insecurity preventing them from accessing their land, 
cent of households in Borno and around a third 
in Yobe and Adamawa were able to sow crops in the ˜˚˛˝ 
season (CILSS-CH, ˜˚˛˝.) The conˇict also limited pastoralists™ 
access to grazing areas and veterinary services (FAO-GIEWS, 
September ˜˚˛˝).Insecurity in Benue, Plateau, Katsina, Zamfara and Sokoto 
states prevented people from engaging in normal livelihood 
activities. In Plateau, conˇict between herders and farmers 
reduced the area planted, and crop production was 
below-average (CILSS-CH, ˜˚˛˝). In some areas, harvests were 
either looted or burned by bandits. Traders avoided affected 
areas due to fear of attacks, limiting trade ˇows and market 
supplies in some of the worst-affected parts of Katsina and 
Zamfara states. In some areas of Katsina, growing tall crops 
such as maize, millet, and sorghum was restricted within 
distances of ˛
-˜ kilometres of settlements for fear of attacks by 
bandits, limiting local staple production to short crops, such 
as rice, cowpeas, groundnuts and sweet potatoes (FEWS˙NET, 
June ˜˚˛˝).While price of coarse grains had remained mostly stable or 
declined in October ˜˚˛˝ compared to their year-earlier levels, 
prices of rice increased signiˆcantly, mainly as a result of 
lower supplies after the Government of Nigeria unilaterally 
closed the border with the Niger, Cameroon and Chad as a 
security and trade protectionist measure (In August ˜˚˛˝, 
(WFP and FEWS˙NET, October ˜˚˛˝). High prices were also 
reported for coarse grains, vegetables and livestock products 
in border markets, and more signiˆcantly in the north-east as 
a result of the insurgency (FAO-GIEWS, December ˜˚˛˝).

 FOOD INSECURITYConˇict/insecurity
The prolonged occupation, blockade on Gaza and outbreaks 
of hostilities have eroded the resilience of Palestinians. They 
are increasingly less able to cope with sudden shocks, such as 
spikes in conˇict, demolitions in the West Bank, and natural or 
environmental hazards, such as winter storms, the longer term 
effects of climate change, inadequate water and sanitation 
services and electricity cuts (OCHA, January ˜˚˜˚). 
The situation in Gaza remained particularly fragile. The Great 
March of Return demonstrations since Mar calling for 
Israeli authorities to lift their blockade on Gaza and to allow 
Palestinian refugees to return to their villages and towns 
inside what is now Israel continued (Amnesty International,

Aid workers experience movement restrictions and difˆculties 
in getting visas to access Gaza. The Israeli government bans 
the import of speciˆc humanitarian items into Gaza, and 
Hamas imposes restrictions on humanitarian operations 
within the Gaza Strip. Conˆscation of aid is common from all 
sides, including both Israeli and Palestinian authorities in the 
West Bank and Gaza (ACAPS, October ˜˚˛˝).
In the West Bank, settlement activity and related violence, 
loss of land, the demolition and threat of demolition of 
infrastructure, movement restrictions, and impeded access to 
basic services and livelihoods, including farming and grazing 
lands, as well as poor law enforcement on violent settlers

Jerusalem, was less acute than in Gaza, but growth in ˜˚˛˝ 
was expected to slow to the lowest level of the last ˆve years 
(˛.˜˙percent), down from ˘.˛˙per September 
˜˚˛˝). Economic development is undermined by occupation, 
administrative and physical constraints, and by limitations 
on Palestinian access to land and natural resources especially 
in Area C, which makcent of the West Bank 
(OCHA, January ˜˚˜˚).
In June, a WFP survey in Gaza and the West Bank found that 
poor vulnerable communities were resorting to negative 
coping mechanisms and falling into a cycle of indebtedness to 
meet their most pressing needs. 
In Gaza, morcent of households had debts of 
 made up of unpaid bills 
for electricity and water, grocery shopping and lines of credit 
with friends and relatives. Nearly halfcent) of those 
interviewed reported an increased trend in purchasing food on

more likely to purchase food on credit compared to the

A recent World Bank report called for a review of the Israeli 
application of the system for dual use goods as it limits 
economic diversiˆcation and sustainable growth in the 
Palestinian territories. In agriculture the dual use restrictions 
have lowered the concentration of active chemicals in 
fertilizers making them less effective and lowering land 
productivity to half of that in Jorcent of the 
yield in Israel (WB, April ˜˚˛˝).

cent of prcent of lactating women 
were malnourished in ˜˚˛˝ (UNICEF, ˜˚˛˝). 
Just ˘˝˙percent of children were exclusively breastfed in the 
 life. The relatively high levels of bottle-fed 
children were  concerning, particularly for children in Gaza 
where water is likely to be contaminated (UNICEF, accessed 
January ˜˚˜˚). The lack of growth in exclusive breastfeeding 
over the past years is mainly due to aggressive marketing of 
breast milk substitutes and a lack of clarity regarding optimal 
infant-feeding practices.cent of young children 
in Gaza received a minimum acceptable diet for their growth 
and development (UNICEF, ˜˚˛˝). A high proportion were not 
eating iron-rich foods, increasing the risk of iron deˆciency 
anaemia (UNICEF, ˜˚˛˝).
While there has been an improvement in the daily availability 
of electricity, and the supply of water and waste water 
tre the quality of basic services 
remained extremely poor in Gaza, particularly access to safe 
water and risk of winter ˇooding or exposure to environmental 
health risks along the Gaza shoreline. In the West Bank, poor 
service provisions and demolitions, particularly in Area C, 
remain a concern (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝). 
The protracted conˇict, alongside sudden shocks, is 
overwhelming an already overburdened health system 
(OCHA, January ˜˚˜˚). The dual-use restrictions on medical 
equipment and a shortage of medical supplies are major 
contributors to the evolving health crisis in Gaza. The hospitals 
have limited capacity to manage injuries that require complex 
treatment including health services for women and children 
(UNICEF, September ˜˚˛˝).

 the OctoberŒDecember Deyr rains were late and 
below average with much of central Somalia, as well as parts 
of the north, receiving rcent 
of average (IPC, February ˜˚˛˝). Subsequently, Gu (AprilŒ
June) rains started in late April, after almost a month 
characterized by drought conditions, which severely affected 
crop germination and establishment in southern key cereal-
producing areas. 
Abundant precipitation in May did not signiˆcantly improve 
crop prospects as it occurred too late during the growing 
season (FAO-GIEWS, July ˜˚˛˝) and the Gu harvest in

The Gu-Karan AprilŒSeptember rains in north-western Somalia 
were also characterized by early season dryness, but heavy late 
season rains in August and September boosted yields, and 
cereal production was above the average of the previous ˆve 
years (FAO-GIEWS calculations based on FSNAU data).
Subsequently, central and southern Somalia received well 
above average ˜˚˛˝ OctoberŒDecember Deyr rains, with many 
areas experiencing rainfall that was more than three times the 
average (NOAA, October ˜˚˛˝). 
The abundant precipitation was generally beneˆcial for 
agricultural production, and the output of the secondary Deyr

November ˜˚˛˝). Substantial ˇood-induced crop losses 
were recorded in riverine main maize-growing areas along 
the Shabelle and Juba rivers, infrastructure and roads were 
destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted in some of the worst-hit 
areas (WFP, October ˜˚˛˝). 
Overall, the aggregate ˜˚˛˝ cereal production was estimated 
 about ˛˚˙per 
output and ˜˚ percent below the average of the previous ˆve 
years.
Pastoral areas were also affected by a poor performance of 
the Gu rains, with drought conditions prevailing in April. Late 
season rains in May helped to partially, but not fully, replenish 
pastoral resources. 
However, many pastoral households that had already lost 
much of their herought, faced 
reduced milk availability from their remaining stock and took 
on large debts to cover basic food and non-food needs (FSNAU 
and FEWS NET, September ˜˚˛˝). Pasture, browse and water 
availability markedly improved with the abundant OctoberŒ
December Deyr rains. 
The availability of saleable animals as well as milk availability 
for household consumption continued to gradually improve. 
However, many poor households were still unable to meet 
their minimum food needs without selling their animals to 
the point of endangering the sustainability of their herds and 
their livelihoods (FSNAU and FEWS NET, February ˜˚˜˚).
Prices of sorghum declined in December in southern key 
markets, including the capital Mogadishu,cent in 
anticipation of the Deyr harvest, while prices of maize followed 
mixed trends, increasing in some markets due to the expected 
crop losses in main maize growing areas. Prices of coarse 
grains in December ˜˚˛˝ were about ˘˚ percent higher than 
in the same month of the previous year, mainly due to a tight 
supply situation following the drought-reduced ˜˚˛˝ Gu main 
season harvest (FAO-GIEWS, March ˜˚˜˚). As of November 
˜˚˛˝, the cost of a minimum basket (CMB) was above the ˆve-
year average in the Banadir, Juba, North-east, North-west and 
Sorghum Belt regions (FSNAU, November ˜˚˛˝). 
Conˇict/insecurity
Clan disputes, protests, the weakness of the national forces, 
the gradual withdrawal of the African Union Mission in 
Somalia (AMISOM), Islamic State and continuing Al˙Shabaab 
attacks continued to cause insecurity and instability, 
disrupting livelihoods, markets, trade ˇows and humanitarian 
access and forcing Somalis to abandon ˆelds and productive 
assets (ACAPS, June ˜˚˛˝ and FSNAU, October ˜˚˛˝). 
ACLED data indicated that there were appro 
conˇict events in Somalia in ˜˚˛˝, r

Compared to the peak of 
April ˜˚˛˝), the acutely food-insecure population (IPC˙Phase˙˘

due to lower numbers in the Greater Darfur region. However, 
this improvement was mostly offset by a sharp deterioration

FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE 
 FOOD INSECURITYEconomic shocks 
The economic crisis worsened in ˜˚˛˝ despite the efforts of 
the transitional government and its cooperation with the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in implementing reforms 
to foster a recovery. 
With expenditure remaining high on social and military 
spending, and oil export earnings stagnating, the Government 
faced limited scope for new borrowing, so monetized the 
deˆcit by printing money (EIU, January ˜˚˜˚). Year-on-
year inˇation increased frcent in January to 
cent in November (Central Bank of Sudan, November 
˜˚˛˝). 
As a result of these macroeconomic factors, and with traders 
reportedly hoarding their agricultural produce, regarded as 
a more reliable form of savings compared to the weakening 
local currency, food prices reached exceptionally high levels

displacements following an escalation of hostilities in north-
west Syria and increasing returns and displacements across the 
country. Of particular concern were the north-eastern, north-
western and western governorates where they were large-scale 
displacements (OCHA, October ˜˚˛˝). 
In 2016, these four children ˇed to Lebanon with their mother when armed groups overran their hometown of Souran, north of Hama in west-central Syria.

of ˜˚˛˝, particularly in Dara™a governorate, where violence 
resulted in deaths, looting and other security incidents, 
displacing unknown numbers of people. Access to basic services, 
including health facilities, electricity and WASH, was difˆcult. The 
agricultural sector was highly affected (OCHA, August ˜˚˛˝).
Mass displacement of rural Syrians has had a particularly 
negative impact on the agricultural industry with equipment 
losses and damages to irrigation, roads and energy infrastructure, 
which is particularly troubling since the sector contributes to a 
substantial share of the country™s GDP (FAO, ˜˚˛˝).
Regardless of insecurity, almost ˝˛˙˚˚˚ former refugees returned 
home during ˜˚˛˝, an increase ofcent compar 
(˘RP, January ˜˚˜˚).
Economic shocks
Arcent of Syrians depend on markets for food 
(CFSAM, September ˜˚˛˝). The relative improvements in security 
opened up some important trade routes that had been unusable 
since ˜˚˛˘. However, the economy remains troubled and around 
cent of Syrians mentioned unemployment as their main 
problem (WFP, ˜˚˛˝). 
Post-harvest losses, increased fuel prices and the depreciated 
Scent against the USD between 
January ˜˚˛˝ and ˜˚˜˚ (WFP, January ˜˚˜˚) led to higher food 
prices acrosates (CFSAM, September ˜˚˛˝).
By November, the reference food basket price had increased by

Farmers continued to face challenges with high production and 
transportation costs, as well as limited quality inputs. Fruit and 
vegetable production was challenged by low purchasing power 
of consumers, the inability to export produce and shortage of 
domestic processing (FAO-GIEWS, September ˜˚˛˝). 
Fason, agricultural prospects were positive as 
a result of favourable weather conditions and displaced farming 
households returning home. Wheat and barley planted areas

Economic shocks
Lebanon is experiencing a macroeconomic crisis marked by 
very high levels of public debt. The cost of living has ballooned, 
salaries have stagnated and unemployment rates have risen, 
prompting a signiˆcant proportion of the country™s well-educated 
youth to emigrate. A planned tax on free phone calls over social 
media applications, announced in October along with other 
austerity measures, prompted mass demonstrations bringing 
most of the country to a standstill (ICG, October ˜˚˛˝).

The harvest of sorghum, the main cereal grown in the area, 
was concluded in several areas in December with about two 
months of delay and production was estimated by FEWS NET

FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE FOOD 
INSECURITYWeather extremes and crop pests
The ˜˚˛˝ Msimu harvest, completed in June in western, 
central and southern unimodal rainfall areas, was estimated 
to be above average thanks to adequate and well
-distributed 
rainfall. However, in northern, north
-eastern and coastal 
bimodal rainfall areas, the Masika main season harvest in 
August was well below average, due to erratic rains in the 
MarchŒMay long rainy season and fall armyworm outbreaks, 
which were estimated at morcent in Manyara, 
Geita, Kagera, Simiyu and Kilimanjaro regions (FAO
-GIEWS). 
A needs assessment carried out by FAO in Iringa, Manyara 
and Morogoro Œ which account for ˛˛˙percent of the national 
maize production Œ found that in the three rcent 
of farmers suffered yield losses due to the pest and that on 
average they lost ˛˛˙percent of the total maize crop (Turot et al, 
forthcoming).The ˜˚˛˝ aggregate cereal production was estimated at about 
˛˚˙million tonnes, ˘˙percent down from the output obtained in 
age of the previous ˆve years (FAO
-GIEWS).Exceptionally abundant rains during the OctoberŒDecember 
˜˚˛˝ short rainy season boosted crop yields, but also triggered 
ˇooding, causing localized crop losses and damage to 
infrastructure. Mara was one of the most affected regions at 
the end of October with homes and infrastructure, including 
roads and bridges, either destroyed or damaged. 
acres of crop farms were washed away (IFRC, November ˜˚˛˝).
Economic shocks
As a result of poor weather conditions and lower agricultural 
production, reduced labour opportunities in farming 
and above-average staple prices contributed to reducing 
households™ purchasing power in ˜˚˛˝. Prices of maize 
followed a sustained, albeit irregular, increasing trend 
throughout ˜˚˛˝, as a result of sustained exports to Kenya, 
Rwanda and particularly Zimbabwe as well as the reduced 
Masika harvest and the heavy rains that disrupted trade ˇows 
and inˇated transport costs (FAO

BACKGROUND 
Despite possessing the world™s largest oil reserves, the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is currently one of the 
world™s most concerning acute food insecurity hotspots. The 
catalyst for the crisis was the sharp decline in global oil prices 
from ˜˚˛˘, prompting national oil production to almost half 
and the economy to contrcent between ˜˚˛˘ and 
 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
The loss of income-earning opportunities, hyperinˇation and 
general collapse of the country™s public infrastructure and 
services, have made daily life a struggle for survival for most 
Venezuelans (Wilson Centre, September ˜˚˛˝). 
ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY 
OVERVIEW 
Around ˝.˘˙million Venezuelans Œ a third (˘˜˙percent) of 
the total population Œ were food insecure and in need of 
assistance according to WFP™s Emergency Food Security 
Assessment carried out in JulyŒSeptember ˜˚˛˝.
˚ Of these, 
˜.˘˙million were considered severely food insecure and 
 At the end of the assessment 8˙375 valid questionnaires were collected, ensuring statistical 
representation at state level. The prevalence of acute food insecurity was obtained by analysing 
food consumption patterns, food and livelihood coping strategies and economic vulnerability. For 
more information on the FCS and the CARI approach please see chapter 1. The Government of the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela does not endorse the results of this survey.
Since the start of the socioeconomic crisis, nearly 5 million Venezuelans have been driven out of their country as refugees and migrants, making it the 
second largest refugee crisis in the world. The majority are families with children, pregnant women, elderly people and people with disabilities.

following a signiˆcant reduction in the planted area because 
of high costs of and a general lack of agricultural inputs,

. UNICEF collected nutrition status data from 
˛˚˚˙˚˚˚ childrars and pregnant and lactating 
cent of children 
within this group were wasted, considered a ‚medium™ GAM 
prevalence (UNICEF, December ˜˚˛˝). 
In ˜˚˛˝, four major national blackouts left the majority of 
the country without electricity for several days. The power 
disruptions, coupled with medicine and equipment shortages, 
and mass exodus of healthcare workers and specialists, 
have pushed the healthcare system to the brink of collapse. 
Hospital patients Œ many of whom are already critically 
illŒ have a higher risk of acquiring new infections while in 
the hospital, due to a lack of basic cleaning supplies. The 
disintegration of services disproportionately affects the most 
vulnerable, including indigenous populations, children 
under the age ofars, pregnant and lactating women, 
adolescents, those with chronic and non-communicable 
diseases, and the elderly (IMC, December ˜˚˛˝).
 The decline foreign exchange earnings was mainly caused by the drop in oil production as 
the management of the state oil company went into disarray. Economic sanctions imposed on 
Venezuela further limited export earnings and access to external ˆnance.

NUTRITION OVERVIEW
There is a lack of nutrition data on refugees and migrants from 
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. But malnutrition and 
food insecurity are of particular concern in rural and remote 
areas (RMRP ˜˚˜˚). Most Venezuelan migrants in Colombia 
were highly reliant on key food staples, which were consumed 
more frequently than more nutritious and diversiˆed food 
groups (dairy, vegetables and fruit) (EFSA, November ˜˚˛˝).
Access to safe water and solid waste management is 
challenging in several areas both for hosts and migrants, 
particularly when essential infrastructure is lacking or 
overwhelmed (RMRP ˜˚˜˚). Four in ˛˚ migrants did not have

ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY
Acute food insecurity increased
 due to poor rainfall which resulted in crop 
failure and record high staple food prices.
Continued dry-weather in areas that 
suffered shortfalls in crop production 
in 2019 is expected to sustain high 
humanitarian needs, but a foreseen 
upturn in the national agricultural 
output could alleviate overall acute food 
insecurity.

FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE FOOD 
INSECURITYWeather extremes
In ˜˚˛˝, southern parts of Zambia experienced the poorest 
rainfall se˛, which sharply reduced cereal crop 
production. Estimated at ˜.˘˙million tonnes, the ˜˚˛˝ cereal 
output was about ˛˙million tonnes lower than the ˆve-year 
average, leading to an increase in food import requirements 
(FAO-GIEWS, September ˜˚˛˝). The largest shortfalls in cereal 
production were in southern, western, some part of Lusaka 
and central provinces, which also had some of the highest 
rates of acute food insecurity. These areas also experienced 
 which meant that households had 
already faced food availability constr 
August ˜˚˛˝), a situation that compounded the impact of 
shocks in ˜˚˛˝. 
The crop failures in ˜˚˛˝ resulted in regional food deˆcits 
across southern Africa and led to a decrease in food availability 
at the household and market levels (IAPRI, ˜˚˛˝). As a 
consequence, many households resorted to employing 
negative coping strategies, including cutting the number of 
meals per day. 
A secondary impact of the lower harvests was that income-
earning opportunities for rural households were curbed, 
on account of reduced crop surpluses for sale and limited 
seasonal labour needs (FAO-GIEWS, September ˜˚˛˝). 
In parallel with the downturn in cereal production, body 
conditions of livestock deteriorated, reˇecting the inadequate 
pasture and water availability. An increase in disease 
outbreaks among animals led to movement restrictions (IAPRI, 
˜˚˛˝). Both these factors further curbed food availability and 
lowered potential earnings (IAPRI, ˜˚˛˝). 
Economic shocks
In the last decade, Zambia had become a key maize exporter in 
the region, but the decrease in maize production in ˜˚˛˝ led 
to the implementation of an export ban, as the country sought 
to stabilize domestic supplies and ease pressure on prices 
from export-driven demand (FEWS˙NET, September ˜˚˛˝). 
The lower food stocks from own production also made 
rural households more reliant on markets to meet their 
consumption needs. As a result of these supply shortages 
and increased demand, prices of the main food staples 
increased sharply. The retail price of maize products rose by 
AO-GIEWS, January 
˜˚˜˚ and WFP, ˜˚˛˝). 
To prevent further rises and ease access to food, the 
government, in agreement with millers, retailers and grain 
traders, introduced a ceiling on maize grain prices in August 
˜˚˛˝ (FAO-GIEWS, September ˜˚˛˝). The depreciation of the 
national currency and higher import costs exerted further 
upward pressure on food prices (WB, October ˜˚˛˝).

In 2019, Zimbabwe experienced its 
worst drought in decades, which, in 
tandem with the impacts of Cyclone Idai 
and a severe economic crisis that sent food 
prices spiraling created the country's worst 
acute food insecurity crisis in 10 years.
A major deterioration in food 
insecurity is expected as a result of 
persisting economic difˆculties, eroded 
household resilience, rainfall deˆcits 
and forecast low harvests.

Phase ˘) if their livelihoods were not supported. Of particular 
concern were the nine districts classiˆed in Emergency 
 where the results of the ZimVAC IPC analysis 
demonstrated an increase in the number of people facing 
food consumption gaps and forced to employ emergency 
strategies, thus jeopardizing their future (IPC, August ˜˚˛˝). 
The deepening hardship forced families to eat less, skip meals, 
take children out of school, sell off livestock and fall into a 
vicious cycle of debt. 
Little respite is expected for the most vulnerable, including 
subsistence farmers, who grow most of Zimbabwe™s food and 
depend on a single, increasingly erratic rainy season (WFP, 
December ˜˚˛˝).FACTORS DRIVING ACUTE FOOD 
INSECURITYEconomic shocks 
The persisting poor macroeconomic environment, marked 
by hyperinˇation, continued to drive the appalling acute 
food insecurity situation (IPC, August ˜˚˛˝). In July, annual 
inˇation reached ˜˘˚˙percent. Extreme poverty was estimated 
to have risen from ˜˝˙percent in ˜˚˛˝, 
means were living in extreme 
poverty in ˜˚˛˝ (WB, October ˜˚˛˝).
BACKGROUND 
Zimbabwe has only experienced normal rainfall in two of the 
last ˆve growing seasons. It is also experiencing an economic 
crisis characterized by a signiˆcant shortage of currency, 
hyperinˇation, lack of fuel and prolonged power outages 
that have crippled industry and work opportunities (WFP, 
December ˜˚˛˝). 
Widespread poverty, high levels of HIV/AIDS and low crop 
productivity also undermine food security (WFP, ˜˚˛˝). As a 
result, Zimbabwe is experiencing one of its worst acute food 
insecurity crises in a decade, with atypically high humanitarian 
food assistance needs (FEWS˙NET, November ˜˚˛˝ and United 
Nations, December ˜˚˛˝).

The Zimbabwe dollar (ZWL) deprcent 
between February and late October, mostly due to continued 
critical foreign currency shortages (FEWS˙NET, October ˜˚˛˝). 
The government made it the only legal tender in June ˜˚˛˝, 
ending the multi-currency regime that was in place for over a 
decade, but the ZWL continued to fall in value. 
In October, retail prices of maize meal were more than eight 
times higher than the previous year because of the weak 
currency, reduced domestic supplies following a drought-
induced ˜˚˛˝ harvest and foreign exchange shortages that 
curtailed imports (FAO-GIEWS, December ˜˚˛˝). 
In December, most markets, even in typical surplus production 
areas, were without maize grain, increasing demand for maize 
meal and further contributing to high maize meal prices 
(FEWS˙NET, December ˜˚˛˝).
The low cereal season 
depleted household incomes from agricultural-related 
activities, further compounding the effects of inˇated food 
prices (FAO-GIEWS, October ˜˚˛˝). 
While casual labour remained the main income for ˘˚˙percent 
of rural families, those relying on food crop sales reduced 
from ˜˜˙percent in ˜˚˛˝. Cash shortages 
remained the most inˇuential stressors experienced by 
households, followed by increases in cereal prices and 
drought, particularly in the provinces of Manicaland and 
Midlands (SADC, October ˜˚˛˝).
Weather extremes
In ˜˚˛˝, Zimbabwe experienced its worst drought in decades, 
with temperatures hitees Celsius in some areas 
(WFP, January ˜˚˜˚). The limited access to or non-existent 
irrigation facilities increased farmers™ vulnerability (WFP, 
December ˜˚˛˝). 
The record-high temperatures in late October to early 
November affected water sources, agricultural activities and 
livestock. A high number of cattle deaths were reported in 
southern and western areas mainly due to livestock diseases 
(IPC, August ˜˚˛˝), but also to poor pasture conditions and 
water availability (FEWS˙NET, November ˜˚˛˝). 
Cyclone Idai hit the country in March ˜˚˛˝ and affected 
aross nine districts in the eastern 
region as well as parts of southern Zimbabwe. The ˇooding 
and landslides that followed caused severe damages to crop 
and agriculture infrastructure (OCHA, August ˜˚˛˝).
Rainfall conditions were near to average from OctoberŒ
December ˜˚˛˝ despite late onset of rains countrywide and 
false starts in the southern and south-eastern parts of the 
country. Nevertheless, crop establishment was signiˆcantly

in signiˆcant livestock losses, as well as in agropastoral areas 
of eastern Oromiya region, where herd sizes are below-average 
and the ˜˚˛˝ Belg harvest was reduced. The recent desert locust 
infestation will likely contribute to diminished agricultural 
production, placing additional pressure on an already complex 
and fragile food security context. Since June ˜˚˛˝, six regions 
have experienced an infestation of desert locusts (Afar, Amhara, 
Dire Dawa, Oromia, Somali and Tigray), and by early ˜˚˜˚, the 
swarms were reported as having moved towards the Rift Valley, 
which is considered the breadbasket of Ethiopia (FAO, ˜˚˜˚). 
A general election scheduled for August could worsen ongoing 
civil unrest and intercommunal violence. Further displacement 
of people is likely. Inˇation is rising, driving up food prices (WFP, 
January ˜˚˜˚). The overall condition of IDPs and returnees will 
continue to be dire as hygiene and sanitation, as well as shelter 
conditions, are often inadequate (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝).
  Kenya
In the northern and eastern pastoral areas of Garissa, Mandera, 
Marsabit, Samburu, Tana River, Turkana and Wajir counties, the 
abundant ˜˚˛˝ OctoberŒDecember short rains boosted livestock 
conditions and productivity. This generally improved acute food 
insecurity levels from Crisis (IPC Phase ˘) in late ˜˚˛˝ to Stressed 
(IPC Phase ˜) conditions in early ˜˚˜˚. These levels are expected 
to prevail until July ˜˚˜˚ based on IPC February ˜˚˜˚ results. 
However, households that were the most affected by ˇoods in 
Mandera, Tana River and Wajir counties are likely to remain in 
Crisis (IPC Phase ˘). Desert locust swarms in northern and central 
areas, as well as along the shores of Lake Turkana in February 
˜˚˜˚ were expected to expand further into the north-eastern 
areas of the country (FAO, ˜˚˜˚). For the period AprilŒJuly˙˜˚˜˚, 
enya's ASALs were expected to face Crisis 
conditions or worse (IPC Phase ˘ or above) (IPC, April ˜˚˜˚). 
Number of acutely food-insecure people forecast to:

Forecast above-average AprilŒJune Gu rains were expected to 
cause the Juba and Shabelle rivers to overˇow after very high 
water ˇows and levels in late ˜˚˛˝ had damaged embankments.

riverine areas (FSNAU-FEWS NET, February ˜˚˜˚).
  South SudanAcute food insecurity levels are forecast to remain poor 
throughout the ˆrst half of ˜˚˜˚ as the lean season is 
exacerbated by ongoing local conˇicts, years of conˇict-related

and lack of infrastructure. In addition, northern and eastern 
areas that were devastated by ˇoods in late ˜˚˛˝ incurred severe 
livelihood losses. cent of the ˜˚˜˚ national

  The Sudan
A deterioration of the acute food insecurity situation is expected 
until the end of the lean season in September ˜˚˜˚, with 
seasonal trends exacerbated by an earlier than usual depletion 
of food stocks from the reduced ˜˚˛˝ harvest and the worsening 
macroeconomic situation, which is driving extremely high food 
and non-food prices and constraining food access. Despite 
availability of newly harvested cereal crops in January ˜˚˜˚, 
Crisis (IPC Phase ˘) levels continue for IDPs in SPLM-N-controlled 
areas of South Kordofan. They also persist for IDPs and conˇict-
affected households in Jebel Marra region in Darfur, and in 
several areas of Abyei, northern parts of North Darfur, parts of 
North Kordofan and parts of Kassala and Red Sea states. 
From FebruaryŒMay ˜˚˜˚, acute food insecurity is expected to 
deteriorate further, with Crisis (IPC Phase ˘) levels expected in 
North Kordofan and Red Sea states, in areas affected by ˇooding 
in Blue Nile, Kassala and White Nile states and for additional 
households in North Darfur. In the absence of humanitarian 
assistance, IDPs and conˇict-affected people in parts of SPLM-N-
controlled areas of Blue Nile and South Kordofan states, and IDPs 
in parts of Jebel Marra region are likely to face Emergency (IPC 
 From JuneŒSeptember,e expected 
to be acutely food insecure and in need of urgent assistance 
(FEWS˙NET, February ˜˚˜˚).
  Uganda Nationally, acute food insecurity is at minimal levels, thanks to 
the above-average second season harvest, gathered in January 
˜˚˜˚. However, Stressed (IPC Phase ˜) acute food security levels 
in Bundibugyo district are expected to rise through May due to 
recent ˇoods, landslides and severe crop damage, which left little 
or no harvests available for own consumption or sale. High food 
prices have forced many households in ˇood-affected areas to 
reduce the quantity and frequency of meals. 
In the agropastoral north-eastern Karamoja region, below
-average 
crop production will result in an earlier
-than-usual depletion of 
household cereal stocks. However, abundant rains in the second 
half of ˜˚˛˝ improved livestock conditions and productivity, and 
an above-average availability of livestock products will maintain 
acute food security at Stressed (IPC Phase ˜) levels. Refugees 
from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
could face deteriorating acute food insecurity if adequate levels 
of humanitarian assistance are not provided. Acute food security 
conditions could deteriorate further in the face of the recent 
arrival of a mature swarm of desert locusts in February ˜˚˜˚ 
(FAO ˜˚˜˚). Considering these factors, from MayŒJune ˜˚˜˚, 
ely face Crisis or worse (IPC˙Phase ˘

REGIONAL FORECAST FOR 
 CENTRAL AFRICA
Protracted conˇict/insecurity in tandem with the

either maintain or increase acute food insecurity levels 
in parts of Central Africa
  The Central African Republic
Seven years since the start of the conˇict, despite the ˜˚˛˝ peace

GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 
 |  203The worst desert locust upsurge in decades is spreading across 
East Africa, threatening the livelihoods and food security of 
the region™s rural population. It is the worst upsurge Eritrea, 
Ethiopia and Somalia have ears, 
ars and in Kars (FAO). 
The upsurge began in the Arabian Pter 
successive cyclones led to favourable breeding conditions, and 
ongoing conˇict in Yemen limited pest control operations. By 
mid-˜˚˛˝, swarms had reached the Horn of Africa (northern 
Somalia, southern Eritrea and northern and eastern Ethiopia).  
Exceptionally heavy rains across East Africa exacerbated locust 
reproduction, and by late ˜˚˛˝ and early ˜˚˜˚, the pests had 
also spread to coastal areas of the Sudan and Eritrea, central 
and southern Somalia, southern Ethiopia, Kenya, eastern 
Uganda and south-eastern South Sudan. Some locusts were 
also reported in northern United Republic of Tanzania and in 
north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Most areas infected by desert locusts, as ofebruary, were 
facing either Stressed (IPC Phase ˜) or Crisis (IPC Phase ˘) food 
security outcomes. Crop and pasture losses had generally been 
minimal in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia with the exception of 
northern and south-eastern Tigray, north-eastern Amhara, and 
eastern Oromia regions in Ethiopia which reported localized 
damages to the Meher crops in ˜˚˛˝. 
According to FAO™s Locust Watch,  a favourable climate forecast 
in ˜˚˜˚ will likely cause the pest to spread, with the start of 
the long rains season in MarchŒApril of particular concern as 
it corresponds with the regeneration of rangelands and the 
start of planting activities. Though control operations were 
underway, they were hampered by limited resources, as well 
as conˇict and insecurity in Somalia and north-eastern Kenya. 
The impact on future food security will be highly dependent 
on the magnitude of production losses, both in marginal 
agricultural zones and in key surplus production areas, as 
well as for rangeland resources. In this context, the Greater 
Horn of Africa Food Security and Nutrition Working Group 
(FSNWG) has developed two scenarios based on the likelihood 
of infestations and expected impacts on crops, rangelands and 
ultimately the food security of local populations. 
In the most likely scenario, households in areas where swarms 
have caused damages Œ particularly those relying on cropping 
activities that are already Stressed (IPC Phase ˜) or worse Œ 
will experience signiˆcant impact on food security. Given the 
average-to-above-average rainfall forecast for the region, the 
main assumption rests on signiˆcant crop losses for affected 
households, resulting in below-average production in some 
areas at a sub-national level, but the impact on national 
production and agricultural labour wages will be minimal. 
Vulnerable populations already affected by recent shocks and 
facing elevated levels of acute food insecurity are likely to face 
further deterioration, particularly in late ˜˚˜˚ and peaking 
during the ˜˚˜˛ lean season.
In the worst-case scenario, desert locust infestations would ˛) 
cause signiˆcant losses during the ˜˚˜˚ main and secondary 
seasons, resulting in below-average harvests, and ˜) cause 
major pasture and browse losses in arid and semi-arid regions, 
resulting in a more dire food security outlook. Food access, 
availability and stocks would be reduced. Pastoralists who face 
reduced rangeland availability would likely resort to atypical 
migration, thus accelerating the depletion of scarce rangeland 
resources and increasing the risks of livestock diseases and the 
likelihood of resource-based conˇicts. Migration options would 
remain limited for the poorest pastoralists and for those living 
in conˇict-affected areas. Under this scenario, a deterioration 
in food security outcomes would likely begin in mid-˜˚˜˚.

period. This reprcent increase compared with the 
same period in ˜˚˛˝. 
In the areas most affected by insecurity, where large numbers of 
IDPs are located, the seasonal deterioration of the food security 
situation will be compounded by conˇict-related livelihood 
losses and disruptions. From MayŒAugust ˜˚˜˚, Emergency 
 acute food insecurity are expected to 
prevail in several areas of Basse Kotto, Nana Gribizi, Ouaka, 
Ouham, Ouham-Pendé and Vakaga prefectures and in parts of 
Haut-Mboumou, Kemo, Mambére-Kadei, Mboumou and 
 Sangha-Mbaéré prefectures (IPC, November ˜˚˛˝). 
  Rwanda and Burundi
With conˇict leading to large population displacements from 
neighbouring countries, food security needs in Burundi and 
Rwanda are expected to remain signiˆcant in ˜˚˜˚ among 
displaced populations, in particular. Both countries hosted 
ongolese refugees each in late ˜˚˛˝ (UNHCR, 
February ˜˚˜˚). In addition, arefugees 
were displaced in Rwanda, having ˇed political unrest from 
 February ˜˚˜˚), and ˛˛˘ ˚˚˚ people were 
internally displaced in Burundi mainly because of weather events 
as of January ˜˚˜˚ (IOM, February ˜˚˜˚). 
In Burundi, above-average rainfall from late ˜˚˛˝ led to ˇooding, 
landslides and damaged crops. In Rwanda, food prices were 
unusually high in early ˜˚˜˚ as a result of increased transport 
costs and trade disruptions caused by torrential rains as well as 
reduced imports from Uganda (FEWS NET, February ˜˚˜˚; FAO-
GIEWS, January ˜˚˜˚). However, in both countries above-average 
harvest prospects were expected to support Minimal (IPC Phase ˛) 
food security outcomes through May ˜˚˜˚. Ar 
wanda are 
likely to face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase ˘ or above) levels of acute 
food insecurity (FEWS NET, February ˜˚˜˚).
REGIONAL FORECAST FOR 
SOUTHERN AFRICA 
Post-harvest improvements are likely to be short-lived as 
poor rains, high food prices and unresolved political and 
economic instability could worsen acute food insecurity.
  Angola and Namibia
Improved seasonal rainfall has helped regenerate pasture and 
water resources and boost crop production prospects in ˜˚˜˚ 
in southern Angola and northern Namibia, following extreme 
dry conditions in the previous year. Agricultural production is 
expected to increase and contribute to an improvement in food 
security. In early ˜˚˜˚,  
e people in Crisis or above (IPC 
Phase ˘ or worse). This situation is mainly due to poor weather 
conditions in ˜˚˛˝. A slight decrease in acute food insecurity is 
projected through September in Namibia (IPC, October ˜˚˛˝).
  The Democratic Republic of the Congo
Acute food insecurity is expected to remain extremely concerning 
in conˇict-affected eastern regions in ˜˚˜˚. In areas of Ituri, 
North Kivu and South Kivu provinces, where conˇict intensiˆed in 
˜˚˛˝, the early ˜˚˜˚ harvest was expected to be below average 
because of disrupted agricultural activities and ˇood-related 
crop losses. Faster-than-normal depletion of household food 
stocks will result in an early onset of the lean season. In parts of 
Kasai Central, an outbreak of cassava mosaic virus could result in 
substantial crop losses. Maize availability is affected by reduced 
imports from neighbouring Zambia and Zimbabwe, where poor 
seasonal rains reduced ˜˚˛˝ maize harvests. 
Despite the start of harvests, in January ˜˚˜˚ Crisis (IPC Phase ˘) 
levels of acute food insecurity were expected to prevail through 
 ˜˜ provinces analysed, with particularly high 
prcent) in Haut-Uele, Ituri, Kasai, Kasai 
Oriental and Tanganyika. The acute food insecurity situation is 
expected to further deteriorate in these areas with the progress 
of the lean season until July, when newly harvested crops will be 
available for consumption. 
Are projected to face Crisis or 
worse (IPC Phase ˘ or above) from JanuaryŒMay, including 
 These numbers reˇect 
an improvement in some areas, such as Greater Kasai, due to 
expected improved security conditions and favourable rainfall. 
In parts of Ituri, Samkuru, South Kivu and Tanganyika, the acute 
food insecurity situation may worsen (IPC, August ˜˚˛˝). 
There was still a high risk of re-emergence of the Ebola virus 
disease in early ˜˚˜˚ (WHO, March ˜˚˜˚).
  Eswatini and Lesotho
In early ˜˚˜˚, both countries' food security levels are expected 
to remain on a par with late ˜˚˛˝. In Eswatini, drier weather 
conditions towards the end of the cropping season are likely to 
maintain near-average cereal production levels in ˜˚˜˚, and 
food security is therefore anticipated to remain mostly stable. 
In Lesotho, a production recovery is expected to bolster national 
food supplies and reduce the number of people in need of 
assistance by the end of ˜˚˜˚. Eswatini had ˚.˜ and Lesotho had 
om 
JanuaryŒMarch ˜˚˜˚. A production upturn in South Africa, the 
sub-region™s main exporter and producer, would likely further 
underpin food security improvement. Its production of cereals is 
forecast at well above-average levels, and this boost to supplies 
will likely reduce prices, thereby helping to improve access to 
food staples for import-dependent countries (IPC, July ˜˚˛˝).  
GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 
 |  205  Madagascar The larger agricultural output in southern and south-eastern 
Madagascar in ˜˚˛˝ was projected to lead to a reduction in acute 
food insecurity, with an estimated ˚. 
worse (IPC Phase ˘ or above) in the JanuaryŒMarch ˜˚˜˚ lean 
season. The population in these districts has limited capacity 
to withstand and recover from weather shocks, and even small 
production downturns can provoke a sharp deterioration in acute 
food insecurity. 
The situation is worst in West Ampanihy District, where 
˘˚˙percent of the population is expected to be in Emergency 
 The number of acutely food-insecure people is 
expected to seasonally decreom AprilŒJune 
(IPC, November ˜˚˛˝). A forecast contraction in national paddy 
production following erratic distribution of seasonal rains could 
push up food prices and lower food supplies at the local level, 
straining food security later in the year. 
  MalawiFood security levels are expected to improve with a forecast 
above-average ˜˚˜˚ harvest, based on generally conducive 
weather. However, high staple food prices are likely to prevent 
a large reduction in food assistance needs. Around ˛.˝ million 
people face Crisis or worse (IPC Phase ˘ or above) acute food 
security outcomes until March ˜˚˜˚ (IPC, January ˜˚˜˚).
  Mozambique 
In some areas affected by cyclones Kenneth and Idai in ˜˚˛˝, 
the recovery process may be slower than expected due to 
severe weather including heavy rains and ˇooding, hailstorms 
and strong winds. In central provinces, the adverse weather 
is expected to result in localised shortfalls in production for a 
second consecutive year in ˜˚˜˚. Meanwhile, southern provinces 
of Mozambique have faced drought conditions. Insufˆcient 
and erratic rainfall resulted in multiple rounds of planting and 
production is expected to be well below average for the third 
consecutive season (FEWS NET, January ˜˚˜˚). Political and 
economic instability, if unresolved, could trigger violence and 
displacement (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝). From JanuaryŒFebruary 
˜˚˜˚, around ˛. 
or above) (IPC, July ˜˚˛˝).
  The United Republic of Tanzania
Acute food insecurity is expected to remain at similar levels 
during the lean season in early ˜˚˜˚. From May, the number of 
acutely food-insecure people (IPC Phase ˘ or above) is projected 
to decline from about ˛ million in November ˜˚˛˝ŒApril ˜˚˜˚ 
 February ˜˚˜˚). This is the result of 
the 'msimu' harvests which are expected to increase cereal 
availability and 'masika' harvest which will boost availability. 
However, political and economic instability, if unresolved, could 
trigger violence and displacement (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝).
  Zambia
While conditions may improve at the national level, they may 
worsen in the south where heavy rainfall since the beginning of 
January led to riverine and ˇash ˇoods. The ˇooding destroyed 
crops, including maize, in some of the areas heavily affected by 
the last season™s drought, according to the Government™s Disaster 
Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU). In addition, erratic 
rains and dry spells at the beginning of the rainy season in 
November had already compromised the planting period in the 
southern region. These recurrent climate shocks could aggravate 
the already fragile food security situation. From March, food 
security levels were expected to improve based on a forecast 
increase in the national cereal output. However, high prices of 
staple foods are likely to inhibit a more substantial improvement. 
Around ˜.˘ million people were expected to face Crisis or worse 
(IPC Phase ˘ or above) levels of acute food insecurity during the 
lean season in October ˜˚˛˝ŒMarch ˜˚˜˚ (IPC November ˜˚˛˝).
  ZimbabweThe alarming acute food insecurity situation is expected to 
worsen in ˜˚˜˚. Persisting economic difˆculties have eroded the 
resilience of households. Given limited indications that there will 
be a signiˆcant turnaround in the economy during the ˆrst half of 
˜˚˜˚, households are likely to continue to face severe food access 
constraints. Early rainfall deˆcits caused permanent wilting of 
crops in localized areas, while erratic rainfall is expected to result 
in a decline in crop productivity in the ˜˚˛˝/˜˚˜˚ season. 
The ongoing economic crisis has hindered farmers™ access to 
agricultural inputs, causing a reduction in the area planted with 
maize. The ˜˚˜˚ harvest is forecast to remain below the ˆve-year 
average, which would sustain a tight supply situation and curtail 
potential earnings from crop sales for farming households. As 
a result, the acutely food-insecure rural population in need of 
urJune ˜˚˜˚ (IPC, 
March ˜˚˜˚).
REGIONAL FORECAST FOR WEST 
AFRICA, THE SAHEL AND CAMEROON
Increasing violence and displacement in conˇict-affected 
areas as well as weather extremes and disrupted 
regional trade will drive up acute food insecurity in 
many countries of West Africa. 
  Burkina Faso
The escalation of conˇict in northern areas (Nord, Centre-Nord 
and Sahel regions) and its spread to the eastern areas (Est region) 
is driving one the world™s fastest growing humanitarian crises. 
The number in Crisis or worse (CH Phase ˘ or above) during the 
JuneŒAugust ˜˚˜˚ lean season is forecast at ˜.˜ million, three 
times the estimated number in the same period last year (RPCA, 
206  | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020
April ˜˚˜˚). The sharp increase in the number and gravity of 
 February 
ease compared to January ˜˚˛˝ Œ resulting 
in severe livelihood losses (UNHCR, February ˜˚˜˚). In conˇict-
affected areas, many farmers have been forced to abandon their 
ˆelds, while pastoralists have faced restricted animal access to 
pasture and water points as well as episodes of cattle raiding. 
Food markets are either closed or poorly attended by traders, 
sellers and buyers, while road ambushes and the looting of 
trucks have disrupted trade ˇows between the country™s main 
western cereal-producing areas and the northern conˇict-affected, 
cereal deˆcit areas (FEWS NET, January ˜˚˜˚). Constraints to 
humanitarian access often result in irregular and reduced food 
assistance operations. 
Cameroon
Continued violence and instability will continue to drive high 
levels of acute food insecurity. About ˜.e

acute food insecurity from JanuaryŒMarch ˜˚˜˚ before reducing 
to ˜.˛ million in JuneŒAugust ˜˚˜˚ (CILSS-CH, March ˜˚˜˚). 
Boko Haram attacks in the Far North region continue, as does 
the precarious situation in North West and South West regions, 
where clashes between armed secessionists and security forces 
are disrupting agricultural and market activities and causing new 
displacements. Reduced exports to Nigeria also disrupt livestock 
and agricultural trade ˇows, lowering the purchasing power of 
producers (FEWS NET, January ˜˚˜˚).  As of January ˜˚˜˚, the 
number of IDP in addition to ˜˝˘ 
Central African refugees and ˛˛˛ ˚˚˚ Nigerian refugees (UNHCR, 
January ˜˚˜˚).
  ChadThe number of acutely food-insecure people in Crisis or worse 
(CH Phase ˘ or above) during the JuneŒAugust ˜˚˜˚ lean season 
is forecast at ˛.˚ million,cent higher than the estimated 
number in the same period last year (CILSS-CH, March ˜˚˜˚). 
This sharp deterioration is mainly driven by heightened violence 
in conˇict-affected Lac and Tibesti regions, resulting in new 
displacements and increasing food prices. Climatic events, such 
as prolonged dry spells in Bahr El Ghazal, Hadjer, Kanem and 
Lamis regions, are contributing to deteriorating crop and livestock 
conditions (FEWS NET, January ˜˚˜˚). Meanwhile, ˇoods in 
Mandoul and Moyen-Chari regions in October resulted in 
displacements and livelihood losses (FEWS NET, October ˜˚˛˝).
  Côte d™Ivoire and Sierra Leone
With ˜˚˛˝ crop production lower than the previous year, food 
prices are expected to remain high in Sierra Leone in ˜˚˜˚. 
Currency depreciation could also limit food access for the most 
vulnerable, market-dependent populations (RPCA, April ˜˚˜˚). 
The border closures in Nigeria continue to disrupt regional 
trade and result in economic and food losses in countries across 
the region, such as Côte d™Ivoire (RPCA, April ˜˚˜˚), where the 
appreciated value of the CFA franc against the USD will further 
affect exports and producers™ incomes (ADB, January ˜˚˜˚).
  The Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau 
         and MauritaniaAround ˛.˛ million are expected to be facing Crisis or worse (CH 
Phase ˘ or above) from JuneŒAugust ˜˚˜˚ in these four countries 
(RPCA, April ˜˚˜˚). With ˜˚˛˝ crop production lower than the 
previous year, food prices are expected to remain high in the 
Gambia. Currency depreciation in Guinea could also limit food 
access for the most vulnerable, market-dependent populations 
(RPCA, April ˜˚˜˚). Prices of cashew nuts in Guinea-Bissau are 
likely to remain below the government-ˆxed price level, and 
could further decrease following the next harvest, signiˆcantly 
constraining rural populations™ incomes and access to food. 
Mauritania has experienced a third consecutive year of 
pasture deˆcits in border areas, placing additional pressure on 
pastoralists and natural resources (FEWS NET, February ˜˚˜˚). 
Floods contributed to localized crop production shortfalls in 
southern areas. Despite well-supplied markets and stable food 
prices, an early onset of the lean season in ˜˚˜˚ and increased 
market reliance of agro-pastoral and pastoralist households is 
expected (FEWS NET, January ˜˚˜˚). Are

lean season in JuneŒAugust ˜˚˜˚ (RPCA, April ˜˚˜˚).  
  MaliWhile security improved in northern areas in ˜˚˛˝, insecurity is 
severely affecting the more populated central areas, where armed 
groups are mostly targeting civilians. As of January, persisting 
insecurity in the Liptako Gourma areas and in Menaka continued 
to disturb movements of livestock, which could worsen body 
conditions (FEWS NET, January ˜˚˜˚). Violence and displacement 
are forecast to continue in ˜˚˜˚. As a result, about ˛.˘ million 
people are expected to face Crisis or worse (CH Phase ˘ or above) 
during the JuneŒAugust ˜˚˜˚ lean season. This is more than 
double the estimated ˜˚˛˝ lean season number. Forty percent of 
the projected acutely food-insecure population is located in the 
central Mopti region (RPCA, April ˜˚˜˚).
  The Niger
The number of people facing Crisis or worse (CH Phase ˘ or 
above) during the JuneŒAugust ˜˚˜˚ lean season is forecast at 
˜.˚ million, morcent higher than the same period 
last year (CILSS-CH, March ˜˚˜˚). This can be attributed to the 
prolonged conˇict in neighbouring Burkina Faso, Mali and 
Nigeria spreading into the Niger, disrupting agriculture, transport 
and markets and resulting in displacement, particularly in Diffa, 
Tahoua and Tillabery regions. Dry spells, ˇoods and pest attacks in

GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020 
 |  207lean season (CILSS and Ministère de l™Agriculture et de l™Elevage, 
November ˜˚˛˝). Drought conditions, limited animal mobility 
due to conˇict and the closure of the border with Nigeria have 
curtailed the demand for livestock and driven down livestock 
prices, negatively affecting pastoralist household incomes and 
purchasing power in ˜˚˜˚ (FEWS NET, January ˜˚˜˚).
  Northern NigeriaThe number of acutely food-insecure people (CH Phase ˘ or 
above) during the JuneŒAugust ˜˚˜˚ lean season is forecast at 
.˛ million,cent up from the same period last year 
(CILSS-CH, March ˜˚˜˚). The expected deterioration is mainly 
due to the intensiˆcation of armed violence in conˇict-affected 
north-eastern areas (Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states), where 
tight supplies continue to sustain high food prices. In these 
states, around ˘.e expected to be facing 
Crisis or worse (CH Phase ˘ or above) in JuneŒAugust ˜˚˜˚ Œ 
which constitutes a signiˆcant increase (˜˘ percent) compared 
to the same period in ˜˚˛˝.  Escalating intercommunal conˇict 
and armed banditry in north-western and central areas (Kaduna, 
Katsina, Kebbi, Kogi, Nasarawa, Niger, Plateau and Zamfara 
states), and widespread ˇoods from JuneŒOctober ˜˚˛˝ also 
resulted in localized livelihood losses, affecting the food security 
of local populations in ˜˚˜˚ (FEWS˙NET, January ˜˚˜˚). Border 
closures continue to limit food imports Œ particularly of rice Œ and 
drive up prices (FAO-GIEWS, February ˜˚˜˚).
  Senegal Poor and erratic rainfall and prolonged dry spells have led to 
pasture deˆcits for a third consecutive year in areas bordering 
Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali and the Niger and created additional 
pressure on pastoral households and natural resources 
(FEWS NET, February ˜˚˜˚). Floods affected crop production, 
contributing to a fall in cereal prcent 
compar Despite well-supplied markets and stable 
food prices, an early onset of the lean season in ˜˚˜˚ and

REGIONAL FORECAST FOR ASIA 
 AND THE MIDDLE EAST
Violent conˇict will drive alarming rates of acute food 
insecurity and acute malnutrition across the most 
troubled areas of this region. 
  Afghanistan
In Afghanistan, high levels of acute food insecurity and 
malnutrition are expected in ˜˚˜˚ due to the cumulative 
impacts of decades of war, continued insecurity, repeated 
displacement, the lingering impact of the drought in rural areas, 
annual ˇooding, and related interruptions to agriculture. Other 
notable contributors to acute food insecurity include widespread 
unemployment, loss of livelihoods, grinding poverty, high market 
reliance and elevated food prices (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝). Given 
the political instability, the security outlook for early ˜˚˜˚ looks 
mostly unchanged from ˜˚˛˝. Average rainfall levels are expected 
in ˜˚˜˚ (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝). Some ˛˛.˘ million people were 
estimated to be in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase ˘ or above) up to 
March ˜˚˜˚, based on projections for ˜˚˜˚ (IPC November ˜˚˛˝). 
Bangladesh (Cox™s Bazar)
The majority of
 Rohingya refugees residing in Teknaf 
and Ukhiya upazilas of Cox™s Bazar are expected to remain in 
˜˚˜˚.˜ The environment may become more complex, driven by 
factors such as evolving public opinion and decreasing social 
cohesion, following deteriorating security around camps in ˜˚˛˝, 
especially for women and girls. Government policy considerations 
and humanitarian access constraints may present further 
challenges Œ although dependence on external aid will likely 
continue. Without continued funds, the basic services put in place 
for Rohingya refugees could be at risk, with potential to endanger 
lives and lead to a rapid security breakdown. The impact of a 
cyclone would be devastating for the fragile camps and the 
Bangladeshi communities, in particular those on the coastline 
(JRP, March ˜˚˜˚).
The Democratic People™s Republic of Korea
The geopolitical situation will likely remain volatile, with 
the protracted humanitarian crisis experienced by the most 
vulnerable unlikely to abate. Limited availability of agricultural 
inputs is likely to remain in ˜˚˜˚, ensuring that a lack of dietary 
diversity, acute food insecurity and malnutrition remain critical 
challenges. The health system faces a pressing shortage of 
essential medical supplies (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝).
Iraq
Intermittent conˇict and sociopolitical unrest continue 
to aggravate and threaten livelihoods. High levels of 
unemployment, perceived corruption and lack of basic services 
sparked widespread protests from October ˜˚˛˝, incurring 
adverse consequences for food security (WFP, January ˜˚˜˚). 
Without communal reconciliation, large-scale reconstruction, 
and widespread economic rejuvenation, high numbers of IDPs, 
returnees and host communities will remain vulnerable. The 
pace of closures and consolidations of IDP camps is an area of 
uncertainty for ˜˚˜˚: when families are relocated to non-camp 
settings, it is harder for humanitarian organizations to service 
their needs or track their vulnerabilities (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝).

Government-UNHCR registration exercise as of 31 December 2019. This ˆgure was released after 
completion of the JRP 2020 planning process, using a planning ˆgure of 855 000 persons.
208  | GLOBAL REPORT ON FOOD CRISES 2020
Lebanon
Lebanon is facing a macroeconomic crisis, and the ongoing 
political deadlock that followed the Prime Minister™s resignation 
under pressure from anti-government protests is likely to 
accelerate the economic decline. The country™s very high public 
debt is placing a strain on foreign currency reserves, leading to 
reduced capacity to import critical goods, such as food and fuel. 
The local currency deprcent on the informal 
market from October ˜˚˛˝ŒFebruary ˜˚˜˚, eroding people™s 
purchasing power (WFP, March ˜˚˜˚).
Pakistan
Pakistan is experiencing its worst locust infestation since the 
˛˝˝˚s following a drought period. The Government has declared 
a state of emergency and it is particularly worried about the 
potential impact on domestic food production to vulnerable 
agropastoral populations (FAO, April ˜˚˜˚). Nearly a decade of 
conˇict and terrorism in ˛˘ newly-merged districts/tribal sub-
divisions of Bajaur, Khyber, Kurram, Mohmand, North Waziristan, 
Orakzai and South Waziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly 
known as Federally Administered Tribal Agencies (FATA)) and 
Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Kohat, Lakki Marwat, Peshawar and 
Tank (formerly known as Frontier regions), have caused major 
population displacements, disrupted livelihoods and severely 
damaged rural infrastructure and markets. Although the security 
situation has improved, in ˜˚˜˚, people are expected to continue 
facing difˆculties in restoring their livelihoods. Their lack of 
purchasing power will likely be exacerbated by rising food prices 
as well as livestock diseases. Consequently, from JuneŒAugust 
˜˚˜˚, arcent of the population 
analysed) are expected to face Crisis or worse conditions (IPC 
Phase ˘ or above) (IPC, April ˜˚˜˚).
˜Palestine
The political situation and other main drivers of acute food 
insecurity are likely to remain largely unchanged in ˜˚˜˚. In 
the absence of investment, there is growing pressure placed on 
coping mechanisms, thereby deepening the vulnerability of the 
population. In the West Bank, policies and practices affecting 
Area C, East Jerusalem and the Israeli-controlled part of Hebron 
city are expected to continue, leading to erosion of livelihoods. 
Economic development will remain hampered by the limitations 
on Palestinian access to land and natural resources, and by a 
multi-layered system of administrative, bureaucratic and physical 
constraints, including the Barrier (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝).
The Syrian Arab Republic
In early ˜˚˜˚ the humanitarian situation in north-west Syria 
was deteriorating at an alarming rate, as military operations 
and clashes intensiˆed across the Idleb area, including in parts 
of northern Hama and western Aleppo (OCHA, February ˜˚˜˚). 
 Preliminary ˆndings pending ofˆcial release at country level
Between early December ˜˚˛˝ and late February ˜˚˜˚, more 
than ˝˚˚ ˚˚˚ people were estimated to have ˇed their homes 
or shelters in Idlib for northern Idlib and Aleppo governorates, 
seeking refuge in increasingly crowded areas (UNHCR, February 
˜˚˜˚). Hostilities are having a devastating impact on key civilian 
infrastructure, particularly health facilities across Idlib and 
western Aleppo governorates (OCHA, February ˜˚˜˚).
Newly displaced people, overburdened communities, 
spontaneous returnees and IDPs living in sites of last resort, 
collective centres or in open areas are expected to remain 
particularly vulnerable in ˜˚˜˚. Food access was expected to 
worsen as food prices are rising (the reference food basket was 
cent higher in February ˜˚˜˚ than in October ˜˚˛˝) and 
traders are unwilling to grant credit. The informal exchange rate 
is depreciating both in the Syrian Arab Republic and in Lebanon, 
further complicating the inˇow of goods into the country (WFP, 
March ˜˚˜˚). Households headed by women and children, and 
people with disabilities will be highly vulnerable. Humanitarian 
access Œ including to conduct needs assessments Œ is likely to 
vary across the country. It continues to be severely challenged by 
several factors, including hostilities, administrative regulations 
and restrictions on staff movements (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝).
  Yemen
The beginning of ˜˚˜˚ was marked by the prospects for peace 
in Yemen, with the UN-backed Stockholm Agreement leading 
to a signiˆcant drop in violence in Hodeidah. However, conˇict 
remains intense in several areas of the country and violence will 
likely continue (ACLED, January ˜˚˜˚). The combined effects of 
conˇict, macroeconomic crisis, weather-related shocks and crop 
pests, including fall armyworm and desert locusts, are likely to 
lead to persisting levels of acute food insecurity in ˜˚˜˚ and 
may further increase acute malnutrition across the country. These 
conditions will likely ensure that Yemen remains the world™s 
worst global food insecurity and malnutrition crisis in ˜˚˜˚. 
Should peace process efforts bring about a substantial lowering 
of the intensity of the conˇict, this could provide some respite, 
but the process is likely to be protracted. 
The number of acutely food-insecure people is expected to 
ex based on FEWS NET, and the risk of Famine 
 particularly if conˇict signiˆcantly disrupts 
port operations (FEWS NET, February ˜˚˜˚).
REGIONAL FORECAST FOR EUROPE
Ukraine (Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts)
December ˜˚˛˝ marked an important turning point and

conˇict settlement process. Other promising actions included the 
disengagement of forces in several areas and the exchange of 
prisoners. However, humanitarian needs in conˇict-affected areas 
of Eastern Ukraine (Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts) are expected 
to remain severe in ˜˚˜˚ because of the effects of the six-year 
crisis on the lives, livelihoods and resilience of people. The most 
vulnerable are urban populations living closest to the ‚contact 
line™ (OCHA, January ˜˚˜˚). 
REGIONAL FORECAST FOR LATIN 
AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN
Sociopolitical crises, lack of employment and high food 
prices are likely to lead to deteriorating acute food 
insecurity in some countries.Colombia
Conditions within the Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) will 
likely maintain the continuous ˇow of people to Colombia, 
with an increase in their needs upon their arrival in the country. 
The restrictions imposed by other countries Œ as well as the 
degree of access that the Government of Colombia has offered 
to Venezuelans Œ will have an impact on the number of those in 
transit and with intent to stay in C, January ˜˚˜˚).
  HaitiThe sociopolitical unrest that paralyzed the economy and drove 
up food prices in ˜˚˛˝ (WFP, January ˜˚˜˚) had stabilized by 
early ˜˚˜˚, allowing for transportation and commercial activities 
to resume. However, the current dysfunction of Parliament creates 
uncertainty, and mass protests and episodes of violence may 
resurface in coming months (FAO, January ˜˚˜˚) and further 
weaken the country™s economy. This in turn will diminish the 
ability of the poorest Haitians to meet their basic needs, as well 
as the capacity of the State to provide essential services (OCHA, 
December ˜˚˛˝). 
Household food security therefore remains fragile, hampered 
by high food prices, the lack of employment opportunities 
and the residual effects of the sociopolitical crisis (FEWS NET, 
January ˜˚˜˚). According to the October ˜˚˛˝ IPC analysis, if no 
actions were taken to restore the food security and livelihoods 
of vulnerable populations, the number of people facing Crisis or 
worse (IPC Phase ˘ or above) would increase from ˘. 
October ˜˚˛˝ŒF˛ million during the MarchŒ
June ˜˚˜˚ lean season (IPC, October ˜˚˛˝).
Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)
Venezuelans will face continued loss of livelihoods, and negative 
coping strategies could become the norm for the most vulnerable 
(OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝). The crisis is likely to affect increasing 
numbers of people in ˜˚˜˚. International sanctions could deepen 
the economic crisis and internal political tensions may escalate 
domestic unrest (International Rescue Committee, January ˜˚˜˚).
The outˇow of Venezuelans is expected to continue, making it 
one of the world™s largest migr, January ˜˚˜˚). 
By the end of ˜˚˜˚, are expected to be in 
C Various host 
countries have imposed stricter entry requirements to ease the 
burden on near-exhausted response capacities and to defuse 
growing social tensions (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝). 
A substantial increase in those undertaking circular migration 
to meet basic needs is also expected, primarily between the 
Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and Colombia. Other 
vulnerable people will include those returning from Venezuela 
(Bolivarian Republic of) to their countries of origin, people in 
transit and host communities. Refugees and migrants living 
in shelters, on the streets and recent arrivals in a host/transit 
country are among the most vulnerable. Overstretched national 
capacities, as well as the economic and political difˆculties in 
some host countries may adversely affect the refugees and 
migr, January ˜˚˜˚).
The Central American Dry Corridor
The ˜˚˛˝ drought and depressed household incomes, particularly 
for coffee growers, will drive acute food insecurity in the Dry 
Corridor.
From February, the lack of basic grain reserves resulting from 
the prolonged ˜˚˛˝ drought and the fall in demand for casual 
agricultural labour Œ the main source of income for poor 
households Œ were expected to limit food access and signify the 
premature start of the lean season. The decline in international 
coffee prices continues to depress the incomes of coffee growers 
and consequently of those reliant on daily wages as coffee 
cutters. Households in the Dry Corridor will have limited chances 
to save money to buy food, pay credits and save for subsequent 
months (FEWS NET, January ˜˚˜˚).
In Honduras, the number of people in Crisis or worse (IPC˙Phase˙˘ 
or above) is expected to increase from about ˛ million in 
November ˜˚˛˝ŒFebruary ˜˚˜˚ to ˛.˜ million in MarchŒJune 
˜˚˜˚. In AprilŒJuly ˜˚˜˚, ˛.˘ million people in rural Guatemala, 
representing ˛˝ percent of the rural population, are expected to 
be in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase ˘ or above) (IPC, December ˜˚˛˝). 
Around or less than ˚.˛ million people will likely face Crisis or 
worse (IPC Phase ˘ or above) conditions in both Nicaragua and El 
Salvador from MayŒAugust ˜˚˜˚ (FEWS NET, February ˜˚˜˚). 
In ˜˚˜˚, migration from Central America to northern countries 
is expected to continue, spurred by irregular climate patterns 
affecting food production, and criminality/insecurity in the Dry 
Corridor. Migrants face uncertainties amid the implementation of 
deals with the northern countries of Central America that would 
see asylum seekers returned from their destination country to 
their country of transit (OCHA, December ˜˚˛˝).

MALNUTRITION FORECAST 
 EARLY 2020
In a number of countries affected by food crises in ˜˚˛˝, in 
addition to the inadequate dietary intake, a deterioration of 
the malnutrition situation is expected if disease outbreaks are 
not well managed and continue to spread, affecting children™s 
nutritional status. In contexts of conˇict where violence, 
insecurity and displacements are likely to increase, the nutrition 
situation is also expected to deteriorate due to the spread of 
diseases, limited access to food and basic services as well as 
limited access to humanitarian aid, such as in conˇict areas in 
Burkina Faso, Mali, northern Nigeria and Yemen. 
A persistent, deteriorated situation is forecast for countries with 
political and economic crises that are not likely to improve in 
the coming year including Eswatini, Haiti and Zimbabwe. In 
countries with positive food security forecasting, such as Malawi, 
the nutrition situation is not likely to deteriorate.
Nine countries (Chad, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, the 
Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda) affected by 
food crises in ˜˚˛˝ have conducted an IPC Acute Malnutrition 
analysis and produced a forecast for early ˜˚˜˚. The situation is 
expected to deteriorate in all provinces of Chad and the Niger 
due to the seasonal increase in malaria, diarrhoea and respiratory 
infections, which peak from MayŒSeptember, and constitute the 
main driving factors of acute malnutrition in these countries. 
The deteriorating situations expected in Nigeria are the result 
of poor child-feeding practices coupled with seasonal food 
shortages and increased morbidity in the areas surveyed. 
In Madagascar, the acute malnutrition situation was expected 
to deteriorate in more than ˝˚ percent of the ˛˜ areas analysed 
as the forecast period coincides with an increased incidence of 
diseases associated with poor sanitation and hygiene practices. 
The nutritional status in a third of the ˘˛ districts analysed in 
Mozambique are expected to deteriorate in the lean season 
when heavy rains contribute to an increase in the number of 
cases of malaria and diarrhoea. Deterioration is also possible in 
the districts affected in ˜˚˛˝ by cyclones Idai and Kenneth (Cabo 
Delgado and Sofala).

Analysis:Phase name anddescriptionPriority response 
objectiveFOOD SECURITY SECOND-LEVEL OUTCOMES 
Second-level outcomes refer to area-level estimations of nutritional status and mortality that are especially useful for identiˆcation of more severe 
phases when food gaps are expected to impact malnutrition and mortality. For both nutrition and mortality area outcomes, household food consumption deˆcits should be an explanatory factor in 
order for that evidence to be used in support of the classiˆcation.
FOOD SECURITY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS 
For contributing factors, speciˆc indicators and thresholds for different phases need to be determined and analysed according to the livelihood context; 
nevertheless, general descriptions for contributing factors are provided below.
Food consumption
 (focus on energy 
intake)
Livelihood change (assets and 
strategies)
Nutritional status*
ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY FIRST-LEVEL OUTCOMES 
First-level outcomes refer to characteristics of food consumption and livelihood change. Thresholds that correspond as closely as possible to 
the Phase descriptions are included for each indicator. Although cut-offs are based on applied research and presented as global reference, correlation between indicators is often somewhat limited 
and ˆndings need to be contextualized. The area is classiˆed in the most severe Phase that affects at least 20% of the population.

*GAM based on MUAC must only be used in the absence of GAM based on WHZ; the ˆnal IPC Acute Malnutrition phase with GAM based on MUAC should be supported by the analysis of the 
relationship between WHZ and MUAC in the area of analysis and also by using convergence of evidence with contributing factors. In exceptional conditions where GAM based on MUAC is 
signiˆcantly higher than GAM based on WHZ (i.e. two or more phases), both GAM based on WHZ, and GAM based on MUAC should be considered, and the ˆnal phase should be determined with 
convergence of evidence.

Malnutrition.5%5Œ9.9%10Œ14.9% 
 The mortality mentioned above refers to the increased risk of mortality with the increased levels of Acute Malnutrition.
 Priority response objectives recommended by the IPC Acute Malnutrition Reference Table focus on decreasing Acute Malnutrition levels; speciˆc actions should be informed through a response analysis based 
on the information provided by analyses of contributing factors to Acute Malnutrition as well as delivery-related issues, such as government and agencies™ capacity, funding and insecurity in the area.
 GAM based on WHZ is deˆned as WHZ<-2 or presence of oedema; GAM based on MUAC is deˆned as MUAC<125mm or presence of oedema
