               the sustainable development goals (sdgs) are intended to provide guidance to all countries \\nin reaching \\ndevelopment that is environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. while the sdgs are global, \\nthe actions must take place at various scales, including local, national and beyond. many national and \\ninternational development agencies fac\\ne the issue of scaling up successful local level initiatives to a larger \\ngeographic scale. climate change, loss of biodiversity and other global environmental problems manifest \\nthemselves at the local level, with disproportionate impacts on the poorest and\\n most vulnerable groups, \\nmany of whom are women. at the same time, locally\\n-evolved solutions to tackle these problems are \\noften scalable. the role of evaluation is critical in analyzing performance of policies, strategies, and \\nprograms, and to generate les\\nsons about what works, for whom and under what circumstances to \\nfacilitate broader adoption. in this paper we draw upon an evaluation of the global environment \\nfacility/undp small grants program (sgp) that works at the local scale to help communities addre\\nss global environmental issues while improving their livelihoods and reducing vulnerability. the evaluation \\nfound that broader adoption occurs, particularly in the form of replication and scaling\\n-up, and at a local \\nscale, despite a lack of explicit strateg\\ny thereto. the evaluation assessed various models of broader \\nadoption in the program and the specific consequences, both intended and unintended, pertaining to \\nthe official sgp upgrading policy.\\n 3 | page\\n     background and \\nintroduction\\n  using the \\nsustainable development goals (sdgs)\\n1 as a framing reference for development, which all \\ncountries subscribe to, has the potential to significantly shape the \\ndevelopment discourse, \\nand \\ndevelopment itself. as a set of guiding principles and objectives \\nthey \\nset the basis for a common discourse \\namongst policy makers, politicians and citizens on what should be achieved through \\n2030 \\nagenda\\n for \\nsustainable development\\n, with no one being left behind. assessing progress presupposes that there is a \\ncommon understandi\\nng on what each goal means in practice, how it can be measured and what are the \\nunits of\\n analysis, and\\n evidence, that transacts across local, regional and national levels to produce \\nevidence of progress. this is both an evaluation and spatial challenge, gi\\nven that there is limited consensus \\nas to how measurement is to take place, and little understanding in the evaluation community of scale, \\nand what this means when it comes to scaling up for sdgs.\\n evaluation practice in the international \\ndevelopment commun\\nity, while making efforts at an enhanced comprehensiveness and holistic \\nperspectives (garcia and feinstein, 2019), must be better prepared to respond to the complex challenges \\nposed by the sdgs, including scale (naidoo and soares, 2017; steiner, 2017\\n; uitt\\no, puri and berg, 2017\\n).  a key question to geographers is that of scale, and whether the sdg thrust will in fact transect\\n the global, \\nnational and local, and be able to address progress at the local level (sdg localization) and report credibly \\nprogress of\\n the n\\national\\n level\\n, internationally.  \\nthere remains an \\ninevitable tension \\nbetween r\\neporting on \\nprogress \\nfrom a government perspective, over that of beneficiaries, notably at the local level. this brings \\nin the question of how successful sdg localization i\\ns, and whether aggregated data of sdg progress that \\nmay be presented as country progress, does in fact reflect and represent the experiences of citizens, and \\nif so, whether this is the experience of a proportionally significant part of the population. the \\npersistent \\nand even exacerbation of inter and intra\\n-regional inequality has marked development in the last century, \\nand the changing environmental, economic and social landscape, at rates unprecedented, makes \\nmeasurement of sdg progress difficult. it is ev\\nident that in most instances the environment has been \\nadversely impacted through development policies, and negative effects spill over into vulnerable national \\nstates, with dire consequences on overall sustainability of resources, and a disproportional adv\\nerse impact \\non \\nthe poor and marginalized. the sustainability of new ways of doing business in reducing poverty\\n œ through\\n job creation efforts that may be resource consumptive\\n or infrastructure development that may \\ndestroy habitats\\n œ means\\n many intended and\\n unintended consequences which impact on any ecological \\nsustainability. \\n  this paper explores what it means to scale up, and examines why this intent can often be challenging, \\ngiven that theories of change around the sdgs are not clear, and the connectedne\\nss between the sdgs \\nimplies a complexity that is difficult to address in providing coherent progress reports on sdgs.\\n                                                                 1 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/\\n 4 | page\\n    the \\nsustainable \\ndevelopment \\nagenda\\n  when the sgs were launched in 2015 the evaluation community used the opportunity to emphasize that \\nwithin the political construct of the un language on sdgs, there was mention of monitoring and review, \\nalbeit voluntary and country led. there was great sens\\nitivity that any assessment of progress towards \\nagenda 2030 was not seen as an accountability function, or an imposition, and that the right to advance \\nsdgs and report thereupon be voluntary and country led \\nœ the sdg voluntary national review, \\nemphasizing \\npeer\\n-ship over expert imposition, and exercising soft pressure upon countries to exchange \\nas a part of mutual learning and support, over accountability. the un has provided a range of advice, and \\nthe evaluation community offered technical support as needed\\n. the results of the vnrs show an increase \\nin the momentum of countries offering to share experiences, but there remains high variability in the \\nquality of presentations, which are more descriptive of architecture from a government perspective, and \\nless in\\ndicating the engagement with civil society or showing what and when evaluation will be done. \\n  whilst the sdg calls for country led participation, and emphasizes civil society and people, the process to \\ndate has been alive at the level of capitals with the\\n voluntary national reviews (vnrs) reflecting the \\nprogress of monitoring apparatus, by central governments, without much reference to the engagement \\nat the local level, or active participation by civil society, the media or academia. the process, also refl\\nected \\nin the deliberations of the national evaluation conference of the undp in 2017 (turkey, istanbul) under \\nthe theme people, planet and progress in the sdg era, which was a first in bringing together all countries, \\nillustrated that there was no region w\\nith significant progress in sdg attainment, and there was a marked \\ndiscrepancy between political intent and practice at the level of countries themselves.\\n  drawing from \\nevaluations\\n   scaling up in the gef\\n  the goal of the gef assistance to countries is sup\\nport transformational change that would lead to \\nimproved protection of the global environment in areas such as biodiversity conservation, land \\ndegradation, sustainable forest management and carbon sequestration, climate change mitigation, and \\nsustainable m\\nanagement of international waters and chemicals. the projects and programs in these areas \\nincreasingly assume an integrated landscape\\n-based approach demonstrating successful and feasible \\napproaches. they also address constraints pertaining to the enabling \\nenvironment in the countries, \\nincluding legal and policy frameworks and market conditions for environmentally sound products, services \\n  and practices with the aim of broader adoption of such policies and approaches at the country and/or \\nregional level. br\\noader adoption is here defined as, when governments and other stakeholders adopt, \\nexpand, and build on the initiatives that the gef funds, during program or project implem\\nentation or \\nafterwards, as a result of initial successes (gef\\n-ieo, 2017). broader ado\\nption is seen as a necessary step \\ntowards \\ntransformational change.\\n  one of the pathways for broader adoption \\nis scaling up whereby the initiatives supported by the gef are \\nimplemented at a larger geographical scale. this may involve extending the initiativ\\ne™s implementation to \\ninclude more political, administrative, economic or ecological components. such expansion to a larger \\nscale would then help expand the impact of the intervention.\\n another related pathway is replication, \\n  5 | page\\n    meaning that the \\nintervention is reproduced at a similar administrative or ecological scale, often in \\nanother geographical area or region.\\n  the sixth comprehensive evaluation of the gef (gef\\n-ieo, 2017) took a broad look at the portfolio of \\ncompleted projects that had been \\nevaluated independently. out of the 415 projects reviewed, 24% had \\nachieved broader adoption at a large scale, while 37% achieved broader adoption at a local scale. broader \\nadoption was taking place more in countries with higher internal capacity, often mi\\nddle\\n-income countries, \\nwhere institutions and finance existed to absorb and carry on successful initiatives. \\nsimilarly, shifts in \\npolitical priorities in the countries have posed \\nthreats to broader adoption of successful environmental \\nmanagement models. \\nthis demonstrates the \\nimportance of context in which interventions take place.\\n   with regard to sdg 15 \\nœ life on land \\nœ an impact evaluation of gef support to protected areas and \\nprotected area systems (gef\\n-ieo and undp\\n-ieo\\n, 2016) identified broader adopti\\non taking place in \\nnamibia in relation to three protected area projects: bwabwata, etosha and mudumu. in all three \\nlocations, a landscape approach to conservation has been mainstreamed as the policy for the park \\nmanagement agency. efforts are underway to r\\neplicate these landscape and co\\n-management \\nwith local \\ncommunities and conservancies \\napproaches in the zambezi region with the aim of connecting the \\nmudumu park with four other landscape conservation areas. \\nfactors contributing to the expansion \\nincluded shi\\nfts in government policy regarding co\\n-management of protected areas with local people, as \\nwell as contributions from civil society. in namibia, the establishment of conservancies adjacent to \\nprotected areas and the zoning of protected areas to accommodate \\nmultiple\\n-use zones.\\n  scaling up can take place in connection with projects of varying size. here below we focus on the undp\\n-implemented and gef\\n-funded small grants program (sgp).\\n  the \\njoint \\nevaluation of the small grants program\\n  a joint\\n evaluation\\n of the \\nsgp) \\nby the independent evaluation offices of the gef and undp, \\nprovided \\ncritical findings which relate to the environment question, that is represented within the overall sdgs\\n (gef\\n-ieo and undp\\n-ieo, 2015)\\n. these findings related to how the interventions, \\nlocal, and hence termed \\nsmall\\n grants, and needs driven, show the play off between local, regional and national. \\n  established in 1992, the sgp provides technical and financial support to projects that conserve and restore \\nthe environment while enhancing pe\\nople™s wellbeing and livelihoods. in its more than a quarter century \\nof existence, sgp has provided funding to 14,500 projects in over 125 countries. the projects provide \\nfunding of up to $50,000 to community\\n-based organizations, ngos and other local group\\ns to protect the \\nglobal environment while providing sustainable livelihood benefits at the local level.\\n  the evaluation found evidence of broader adoption through the sgp. this most often took place through \\nthe replication of innovations at the local scale\\n: from neighbor to neighbor or from one village to the next. \\nfor example in senegal, sgp™s work in the delta dusaloum that focused on mangrove restoration was \\nreplicated by other villages outside of the initial project area. the evaluation also found cases\\n where the \\nsgp approaches were scaled up even to national levels. for example, in panama an sgp project, which \\ndemonstrated the sustainable extraction of oil from coconuts in the darien region had been taken up with \\nlarge funding by the inter\\n-american deve\\nlopment bank with the intention to carry out a larger project \\nbased on the same approach, while continuing to work with the communities involved in implementing \\nthe sgp grant.\\n 6 | page\\n    a general challenge that sgp faces in reporting on its results is that of \\naggregation (chen and uitto, 2014). \\nthe projects are designed on a community\\n-based approach emphasizing demand\\n-drivenness and \\ninnovation. whereas to be eligible for gef funding, all sgp projects must fit into the overall gef results \\nframework, \\naggregation \\nof the outcomes of a very large number of disparate projects in over 120 \\ncountries is difficult. given the overall scale of the program, there is a clear interest and need from the \\npart of the donors to know how the sgp has contributed to gef™s core missio\\nn of protecting the global \\nenvironment. there is ample evaluative evidence that sgp has been beneficial to the grantees at the local \\nlevel, both in terms of sustaining the environmental resource base and providing enhanced livelihood \\noptions, and that ther\\ne are cases of scaling up. however, the global benefits of the program are harder to \\nquantify. this tension between the local and the global has existed in gef programming for a long time \\n(uitto, 2014).\\n  some of the conclusions that are \\nof\\n importance in a \\ndiscussion on why scale matters are that\\n:   the intervention at the local level did not factor the long\\n-term vision, and in this case the 2015 \\nevaluation \\nlooking backwards had not digested the sdgs;\\n  there were real contextual factors \\nœ an issue of how at th\\ne local level matters are thought \\nthrough, negotiated and implemented\\n œ that\\n due to complexity makes governance difficult, as \\nwell as any measures to improve performance (monitoring and evaluation)\\n.  despite these chall\\nenges, there were tangible benefits from \\nthe\\n grassroots driven program, in that \\ncommunities were supported in \\ntheir \\nlivelihoods, \\nand \\npoverty and gender addressed\\n. there were \\nalso \\ninstances of replicating and mainstreaming, and achievements had fed into nat\\nional development \\nprocesses. the successes brought in more resources, and the coherent nature of the program (global, but \\ngrassroots driven) has balanced both levels, albeit \\nwith \\ntensions. \\n  the key issue has been how different stakeholders™ different view\\ns are balanced, the global and the local. \\n  the lessons from the gef\\n-undp evaluation is instructive to other international agencies which attempt to \\nadvance normative or public goods agendas, and which assume that there will be an uptake by countries \\nthat \\nmay subscribe to certain agreed upon conventions. the reality is often different, and whilst the gef \\nhas a strong implementing partner in the form of the undp\\n and dedicates \\nenough\\n resources to assessing \\nits projects to provide the feedback for course corre\\nction, \\nthis is not as simple when it comes to other \\nconventions. all of these assume that there would be the infrastructure to connect the policy to grass\\n-roots through an implementation architecture. in the case of the gef\\n-undp it was found that moving to\\n the broader adoption across the program was not easy, and tensions between the objectives of each level \\npersisted. \\n    evaluation and \\ngeography\\n  there are a number of\\n reasons why geographical perspectives are useful to program evaluation. we have \\nabove discussed the importance of scale when determining the success and impact of a program. \\ngeography is also an integrated spatial science that allows for the identificatio\\nn, description, analysis and \\nsynthesis of data to demonstrate cause and effect\\n. any program takes place in a complex context that is \\nessential in determining the outcomes. a program cannot thus be evaluated in isolation from that context \\n7 | page\\n  only referring to \\nthe program™s internal logic. an evaluation should always start with an analysis and \\nunderstanding of the context, the system limits and how the intervention interacts with other parts in the \\ncomplex system (garcia and zazueta, 2015). furthermore, the syst\\nem incorporates various actors whose \\nmotivations and goals may not always be compatible. similarly, especially when it comes to environmental \\nprograms, there is always a need to deal with both natural and human systems, with their differing \\ntimelines and g\\neographical manifestations (birnbaum and mickwitz, 2009; rowe, 2012). geographical \\nperspectives provide a very useful lens for evaluators in this setting.\\n  many dimensions of environmental evaluation also lend themselves well to geospatial analysis (lech e\\nt al., 2012), including but not limited to land use / cover change, vegetation productivity, \\ndeforestation and \\nland degradation. similarly, factors such as infrastructure and nightlights (a good proxy for level of \\neconomic development) can be tracked utili\\nzing remote sensing and geospatial tools.\\n  conclusion\\ns  this paper examines the importance of the scale of \\nimplementation of sdgs \\nin a\\nssessing progress\\n at local, \\nregional and national levels\\n and the challenges related to the implementation architecture tha\\nt could \\nconnect global and national policy to results achieved at local level. the paper relies on \\nevidence from the \\nevaluation exercise, particularly from the \\nevaluation of the \\nenvironmental ﬁsmall grants programﬂ funded \\nby the global environmental facili\\nty (gef) and managed by undp. the joint evaluation conducted by the \\nindependent evaluation offices of undp and gef found significant evidence\\n of broader adoption of local \\nlevel interventions, especially in the form of replication and scaling\\n-up. it showed \\nthat\\n the \\ngrassroots\\n-driven\\n program\\n ha\\nd provided tangible benefits to \\nthe \\nlocal\\n population\\n, \\nparticular\\nly in the areas of \\nlivelihoods, poverty\\n, and\\n gender where achievements have fed into national development \\nplanning\\n. moreover\\n, the success of the local\\n-level interventions \\nappeared as \\nleverage\\n for resource mobilization \\ntowards sdgs. however, there \\nwas\\n limited evidence that the intervention at \\nlocal\\n level \\ndid \\nfactor the long\\n-term vision of the sdgs. local level interventions are \\nsubject to \\nissues of real \\ncontextual factors, \\nhow local \\nlevel matters \\nare includ\\ned in the planning and implementation processes, \\ncomplexity \\nat the governance \\nlevel, \\nand the \\nchallenge related to the \\ncapacity to balance stakeholders™ views in the process\\nes. \\nthe \\nevaluation of \\nthe \\nsmall\\n grants program revealed that the scale of implementation \\nmatters\\n and tensions \\npersist between the objectives of each level. \\n  reference\\ns  birnbaum, m. and mickwitz, p., eds.\\n (2009). \\nenvironmental program and

   \\nhuman development report \\n2019\\nforeword˜e wave of demonstrations sweeping across \\ncountries is a clear sign that, for all our pro\\n-gress, something in our globalized society is \\n\\nnot working.\\ndi˚erent triggers are bringing people onto \\nthe streets: the cost of a train ticket, the price \\n\\nof petrol, political demands for independence.\\na connecting thread, though, is deep˛and \\nrising frustration with inequalities.\\nunderstanding how to address today™s dis\\n-quiet requires looking ﬁ\\nbeyond income, beyond \\n\\naverages and beyond today,ﬂ\\n as this human \\n\\ndevelopment report sets out to do.\\ntoo o˝en, inequality is framed around eco\\n-nomics, fed and measured by the notion that \\n\\nmaking money is the most important thing in \\n\\nlife.\\nbut societies are creaking under the strain of \\nthis assumption, and while people may protest \\n\\nto keep pennies in their pockets, power is the \\n\\nprotagonist of this story: the power of the \\n\\nfew; the powerlessness of many; and collective \\n\\npower of the people to demand change.\\ngoing beyond income will require tackling \\nentrenched interestsšthe social and political \\n\\nnorms embedded deep within a nation™s or a \\n\\ngroup™s history and culture.\\nlooking beyond today, the 2019 human \\ndevelopment report articulates the rise of a \\n\\nnew generation of inequalities.\\njust as the gap in basic living standards is \\nnarrowing, with an unprecedented number of \\n\\npeople in the world escaping poverty, hunger \\n\\nand disease, the abilities people will need to \\n\\ncompete in the immediate future have evolved.\\na new gap has opened, such as in tertiary \\neducation and access to broadbandšoppor\\n-tunities once considered luxuries that are now \\n\\nconsidered critical to compete and belong, \\n\\nparticularly in a knowledge economy, where \\n\\nan increasing number of young people are ed\\n-ucated, connected and stuck with no ladder of \\n\\nchoices to move up.\\nat the same time, climate change, gender in\\n-equality and violent con˙ict continue to drive \\n\\nand entrench basic and new inequalities alike. \\n\\nas the human development report sets out, \\n\\nfailure to address these systemic challenges will \\nfurther entrench inequalities and consolidate \\n\\nthe power and political dominance of the few.\\nwhat we are seeing today is the crest of a \\nwave of inequality. what happens next comes \\n\\ndown to choice. just as inequality begins at \\n\\nbirth, deˆnes the freedom and opportunities \\n\\nof children, adults and elders, and permeates \\n\\nthose of the next generation, so, too, policies \\n\\nto prevent inequalities can follow the lifecycle.\\nfrom preœlabour market investments in the \\nhealth and nutrition of young children to inœ \\n\\nand postœlabour market investments around \\n\\naccess to capital, minimum wages and social \\n\\nservices, politicians and policymakers have a \\n\\nbattery of choices that, if correctly combined \\n\\nfor the context of each country or group, will \\n\\ntranslate into a lifelong investment in equality \\n\\nand sustainability.\\nmaking those choices starts with a commit\\n-ment to tackling the complexity of human \\n\\ndevelopmentšto pushing the boundaries to \\n\\nhelp countries and communities realize the \\n\\nsustainable development goals.\\n˜is is the mission at the heart of the united \\nnations development programme, working \\n\\ntogether with the 170 countries and territories \\n\\nwe serve.\\nsome 40 years ago the founding father of \\nhuman development, professor amartya sen, \\n\\nasked a deceptively simple question: equality \\n\\nof what? he answered with equal simplicity: \\n\\nof the things we care about to build the future \\n\\nwe aspire to.\\nprofessor sen™s words help us to take a fresh \\nlook; to go beyond growth and markets to \\n\\nunderstand why people take to the streets in \\n\\nprotest, and what leaders can do about it.\\ni would like to thank all those who have taken \\nthis journey of exploration with us over the past \\n\\n12 months, and i encourage you to read

under the shadow \\nof the climate crisis and sweeping technological \\nchange, inequalities in human development \\nare taking new forms in the 21st century. \\ninequalities in capabilities are

to peo\\n-ple™s aspirations for this century. and doubling \\ndown on reducing inequalities in basic capabil\\n-ities further, while needed, is not enough. if en\\n-hanced capabilities are indeed associated with \\nmore empowerment, ignoring the gaps that are \\nopening up in them can alienate policymakers \\nfrom people™s agencyštheir ability to make \\nchoices that fulˆl their aspirations and values. \\nonly by turning attention towards tackling a \\nnew generation of inequality in enhanced capa\\n-bilities, many of which are only just beginning \\nto emerge, will it be possible to avoid further \\nentrenchment of inequalities in human devel\\n-opment over the course of the 21st century.\\nhow? not by looking at policies in isolation \\nor thinking that a single silver bullet will solve \\neverything. the redistribution of income, \\nwhich o˝en dominates the policy debate on in\\n-equality, is sometimes seen as that silver bullet. \\nyet, even a full redistributive package of four \\nambitious policiesšhigher and more progres\\n-sive income taxes, earned income discounts at \\nlow income levels, taxable beneˆts paid out for \\neach child and a minimum income for all indi\\n-vidualsšwould be insu˘cient to fully reverse \\nthe increase in income inequality in the united \\nkingdom between the late 1970s and 2013.\\n6 ˜is is not to say that redistribution does not \\nmatteršquite the opposite. but long-lasting \\nchange in both income and the broader range \\nof inequalities in human development depends \\non a wider and more systemic approach to \\npolicies.\\nwhat to do? ˜e approach proposed in this \\nreport outlines policies to redress inequalities \\nin human development within a framework \\nthat links the expansion and distribution of \\nboth capabilities and income. ˜e options span \\npremarket, in-market and postmarket policies. \\nwages, proˆts and labour participation rates \\nare typically determined in markets, which \\nare conditioned by prevailing regulations, in\\n-stitutions and policies (in-market). but those \\noutcomes also depend on policies that a˚ect \\npeople before they become active in the econo\\n-my (premarket). premarket policies can reduce \\ndisparities in capabilities, helping everyone \\nenter the labour market better equipped. in-\\nmarket policies a˚ect the distribution of in\\n-come and opportunities when individuals are \\nworking, shaping outcomes that can be either \\nmore or less equalizing.\\n7 postmarket policies \\na˚ect inequalities once the market along with \\nthe in-market policies have determined the \\ndistribution of income and opportunities. \\n˜ese sets of policies interact. for instance, \\nthe provision of public services premarket may \\ndepend in part on the e˚ectiveness of postmar\\n-ket policies (taxes on market income to fund \\nhealth and education, for instance), which \\nmatter in mobilizing government revenue to \\npay for those services. and taxes, in turn, are \\ninformed by how much society is willing to \\nredistribute income from those with more to \\nthose with less.\\n˜e future of inequalities in human devel\\n-opment in the 21st century is in our hands. \\nbut we cannot be complacent. ˜e climate \\ncrisis shows that the price of inaction com\\n-pounds over time, as it feeds further ine\\n-quality, which can in turn make action on \\nclimate more di˘cult. technology is already \\nchanging labour markets and lives, but not \\nyet locked-in is the extent to which machines \\nmay replace people. we are, however, ap\\n-proaching a precipice beyond which it will be \\ndi˘cult to recover. we do have a choice, and \\nwe must exercise it now.\\n4    |    \\nhuman development report \\n2019\\nbeyond income, beyond

2050 \\nclimate change is expected to cause an addi\\n-tional 250,000 deaths a year from malnutrition, \\nmalaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. hundreds \\nof millions more people could be exposed to \\ndeadly heat by 2050, and the geographic range \\nfor disease vectorsšsuch as mosquitoes that \\ntransmit malaria or denguešwill likely shi˝ \\nand expand.\\n˜e overall impact on people will depend

are \\ntropical. yet developing countries and poor \\ncommunities have less capacity than their rich\\n-er counterparts to adapt to climate change and \\nsevere weather events. so the e˚ects of climate \\nchange deepen existing social and economic \\nfault lines.\\n˜ere are also e˚ects in the other direction, \\nwith evidence that some forms of inequality \\nmay make action on climate harder. high in\\n-come inequality within countries can hinder \\noverview    |    17\\nthe di˚usion of new environmentally friendly \\ntechnology. inequality can also in˙uence the \\n\\nbalance of power among those arguing for \\n\\nand against curbing carbon emissions. income \\n\\nconcentration at the top can coincide with the \\n\\ninterests of groups that oppose climate action.\\ninequalities in human development are fun\\n-damental to the climate crisis in another way. \\n\\nthey are a drag on effective action because \\n\\nhigher inequality tends to make collective ac\\n-\\ntion, key to curbing climate change both within \\n\\nand across countries, more di˘cult.\\nyet there are options to address economic \\ninequalities and the climate crisis together, \\n\\nwhich would move countries towards inclu\\n-sive and sustainable human development. \\n\\ncarbon pricing is one. some of the unavoida\\n-ble distributional impacts of carbon prices can \\n\\nbe addressed by providing ˆnancial support to \\n\\npoorer people, hardest hit by higher energy \\n\\nbills. but such strategies have faced challenges \\n\\nin practice, because the distribution of money

inequalities is \\npossible. but it is not easy. it requires clarifying \\nwhich inequalities matter to the advancement \\nof human development and better understand\\n-ing the patterns of inequality and what drives \\nthem. ˜is report urges everyone to recognize \\nthat the current, standard measures to account \\nfor inequality are imperfect and often mis\\n-leadingšbecause they are centred on income \\nand are too opaque to illuminate the under\\n-lying mechanisms generating inequalities. so, \\nthis report argues for the value of looking at \\ninequalities beyond income, beyond averages\\n š \\nand summary measures of inequalityšand \\nbeyond today.\\n˜ere should be a celebration of the remark\\n-able progress that has enabled many people \\naround the world to reach minimum standards \\nof human development. but continuing the \\npolicies that have led to these successes alone is \\ninsu˘cient. some people have been le˝ behind. \\nat the same time, many people™s aspirations are \\nchanging. it is short-sighted for societies to \\nfocus only on inequality in the most basic capa\\n-bilities. looking beyond today means scanning \\nahead to recognize and tackle the new forms \\nof inequality in enhanced capabilities that are \\ngrowing in importance. climate change and \\ntechnological transformations are adding to \\nthe urgency.\\ntackling these new inequalities can have a \\nprofound impact on policymaking. ˜is report \\ndoes not claim that any one set of policies will \\nwork everywhere. but it does argue that poli\\n-cies must get beneath the surface of inequality \\nto address their underlying drivers. addressing \\nsome of these drivers will mean realigning to\\n-day™s policy goals: emphasizing, for instance, \\nhigh-quality education at all ages, including \\npreprimary levels, rather than focusing on \\nprimary and secondary enrolment rates. many \\nof these aspirations are already re˙ected in the \\n2030 agenda for sustainable development.\\npower imbalances are at the heart of many \\ninequalities. ˜ey may be economic, political \\nor social. for example, policies might need to \\nreduce a particular group™s disproportionate \\nin˙uence in politics. ˜ey might need to level \\nthe economic playing ˆeld through antitrust \\nmeasures that promote competition for the \\nbeneˆt of consumers. in some cases, addressing \\nthe barriers to equality mean tackling social \\nnorms embedded deep with a country™s history \\nand culture. many options would enhance both \\nequity and e˘ciencyšand the main reason \\nthey are not pursued o˝en has to do with the \\npower of entrenched interests who stand not to \\ngain much from change.\\n˜us, while policies matter for inequalities, \\ninequalities also matter for policies. ˜e human \\ndevelopment lensšplacing people at the heart \\nof decisionmakingšis central to open a new \\nwindow on how to approach inequality, asking \\nwhy and when it matters, how it manifests itself \\nand how best to tackle it. ˜is is a conversation \\nthat every society must have. it is also a con\\n-versation that should begin today. true, action \\nmay carry a political risk. but history shows \\nthat the risks of inaction may be far greater, \\nwith severe inequalities eventually propelling \\na society into economic, social and political \\ntensions.\\n˜ere is still time to act. but the clock is \\nticking. what to do to address inequalities \\nin human development is ultimately for each \\nsociety to determine. that determination \\nwill emerge from political debates that can be \\ncharged and di˘cult. ˜is report contributes \\nto those debates by presenting facts on inequal\\n-ities in human development, interpreting them \\nthrough the capabilities approach and propos\\n-ing ideas to reduce them over the course of the \\n21st century.\\n20    |    \\nhuman development report \\n2019\\npart\\n ibeyond income\\npart i\\n beyond income:\\n to equality in

1990.1 sen posed that question because celebrating human diversity calls for re˜ecting on the kind of inequality we should ultimately care about. the answer to sen™s question \\nﬁinequality of what?ﬂ is the ﬁinequality of capabilities.ﬂas the second decade of the 21st century \\ncomes to an end, the questions about inequali\\n-ty that motivated sen in the late 1970s have re\\n-surfaced with a

the world, across political \\norientations, feel strongly that income ine\\n-quality should be reduced, a preference that \\nhas intensiˆed since the 2000s (ˆgure˛i.1). \\nindeed, some evidence

life expectancy at older ages \\nis becoming more unequal, as is access to ter\\n-tiary education. in short, despite improvement \\nand convergence in the capabilities central to \\nthe millennium declaration of 2000 and the \\nmillennium development goals, some gaps \\nremain stark, and new ones are opening in \\ncapabilities that will increasingly determine \\ndi˚erences between those who can and those \\nwho cannot take full advantage of the 21st \\ncentury™s new opportunities. time and again, \\nthe analysis shows that countries and people at \\nthe bottom are catching up in basic capabilities \\nwhile those at the top pull away in enhanced \\ncapabilities.\\n7convergence in basic capabilities gives the \\ndirection of change but does not mean that the \\ngaps are fully closed. in fact, those furthest be\\n-hind are making little to no progress. chapter˛1 \\nthus shows that the world is expected to reach \\n2030 with preventable gaps in infant mortality, \\nout-of-school children and extreme income \\npoverty. drawing on granular data to zoom in \\non geographic areas, it documents overlapping \\ndeprivations and intersectional exclusions. \\nfinally, the chapter zooms out on the dynam\\n-ics of riskšhealth, natural disaster or con˙ict \\nshocks that expose groups or individuals to \\nadded vulnerability. behind these patterns lie \\nthe stubborn challenge of strengthening the \\ncapabilities of those furthest behind.\\nthe persistent and increasing inequalities \\nin enhanced capabilities matter more than for \\ntheir instrumental value. chapter˛1 also looks \\nat how they have a bearing on human dignity. \\nindividuals or groups of people might have \\naccess to resourcesšbut not equal treatment \\nthrough formal law or social norms. not all \\nsocial injustices are seen, much less acknowl\\n-edged, by social institutions, and this is o˝en \\nthe case for indigenous or ethnic groups; mi\\n-grants; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and \\nintersex people; and other socially stigmatized \\ngroups that su˚er abuse and discrimination.\\n8 such inequality alsošin too many placesš\\naffects the situation of women, whoševen \\nwhen they

inequality in human develop\\n-ment. such economic inequalities, narrowly \\nconsidered, can be perceived as unfair or can \\nactually constrain people™s well-being (through \\nseveral channels, as explored in chapter˛2). \\nanalysis of income and wealth inequalities is \\nthus necessary and is considered throughout \\nthe report, but focusing exclusively on income \\nand wealth inequalities would be too reductive \\nby failing to acknowledge the full scope of ine\\n-quality in human development.\\nchapter˛2 documents how inequalities in \\ncapabilities emerge, showing how they are o˝en

2030 \\n\\nagenda for sustainable development and its accompa-\\nnying sustainable development goals (sdgs).the global consensus around the sdgs represents an \\nevolution from what the millennium development goals \\n\\nconsidered ﬁbasicﬂ or essential for developing countries \\n\\nby the end of the 20th century. this report is inspired by \\n\\nthat evolution and considers dimensions of inequality that \\n\\nare universally relevant and go beyond the basic.the sdgs seek to reduce inequality in many forms. they not only aim to reduce inequality between and \\n\\nwithin countries (sdg 10) but also envision an abso\\n-\\nlute end to some deprivations: poverty in all its forms \\n(sdg 1) and hunger (sdg 2). they also seek to extend \\nsome basic conditions to all people: healthy lives (sdg \\n3), quality education and lifelong learning opportunities \\n(sdg 4), gender equality and empowerment for all wom-\\nen and girls (sdg 5), sustainable water and sanitation \\n(sdg 6), sustainable reliable energy (sdg 7), decent \\n\\njobs (sdg 8) and access to justice (sdg 16). other goals \\naim to advance the provision of global public goods \\n\\n(such as climate stability).as with any global approach, considering a speci˚c set of dimensions has limitations. it does not address all \\n\\ndimensions of unfairness and injustice that might be im-\\nportant in particular places. however, the report com\\n-\\nplements and cross-checks globally de˚ned measures of \\ninequalityšbased on objective datašwith information \\non perceptions of inequality, with measures of inequal\\n-\\nity in subjective well-being and with some nationally \\nde˚ned measures.part i\\n beyond income:\\n to equality in capabilities\\n    |    25\\nspecial contributiona new look at inequalityas every year, the 2019 human development report of the united nations \\ndevelopment programme invites us to take a look at ourselves in the mirror. \\nin systematically integrating information about the development of our so-cieties, we are confronted with the evidence of what we have achieved and where we are failing.this evidence is much more than a compilation of numbers and ˚gures. because it is all about people™s well-being: each gap that persists or grows \\nis a call to respond to the injustice of inequality with effective policies. what can we expect when a girl is born in poverty, with no proper health \\ncoverage and in an environment where it is harder and harder to access drinking water due to climate change? how much longer can our societies keep getting it wrong when what they do breaches basic human rights? \\nthese are the issues with which inequality faces us.we know that inequality takes many forms. many, such as inequalities \\nof income or gender inequalities, have been around us for a long time. it should be a matter of pride that considerable progress has been made in these issues in much of the globe. this report highlights that inequalities in the basic capabilities re˜ecting extreme deprivations are going down. for instance, the world is moving towards average gender parity in access to primary and secondary education. however, at the same time, inequalities \\nre˜ecting greater levels of empowerment and more important for the future tend to be higher and, in some cases, increasing. here, we have the example \\nof women™s representation at the top political level.\\nalthough we still have a long way to go, we have accumulated experi-ence about what works in social protection, ˚nancial instruments and path\\n-ways of social mobility. there are success stories of better representation \\nof women, more equitable participation in the labour market or driving out discrimination against sexual diversity. the paradox of having such long\\n-standing inequalities is that we, as a society, have found pathways for posi\\n-tive change. what is needed in many cases is the political will.yet there are inequalities which face us with even greater challenges. it \\nis precisely on these that the report seeks to shed light: these are inequal-ities which stem from new phenomena and global con˜icts. these inequali-ties are more challenging as they respond to complex and dynamic processes still to be well understood. are we fully aware of the impact of migrations, the effects of climate disasters or the new epidemiological threats to our coexistence? because that is what it is about; how do we manage to live together, in the face of these new scenarios, and achieve greater well-being \\nfor people? it is a path that we must learn to tread together.\\naccess to health, education, new technologies, green areas and spaces \\nfree of pollution are increasingly an indicator of the way in which oppor-tunities and well-being are distributed among groups of people and even between countries.explaining and understanding the dimensions of inequalities most critical to people™s well-being helps in choosing the best lines of action. \\ndiagnosis is not enoughšwe must push for public policies that tackle these forms of injustice.therefore, all countries have a job to do. but over many years we have found that individual efforts are not enough; many challenges demand a collective approach.in the united nations system, we believe that the 2030 agenda for \\nsustainable development and the sustainable development goals (sdgs) are the kind of response needed in these modern times: they take an all-\\nround look at the phenomena and the solutions; they seek convergence between the actions of governments and international agencies; and they are based on transparent and comparable measurements. with their inter-sectoral approach and the commitment of all governments, the sdgs put us all at the service of a single endeavour.\\nthe best example of what we hold in our own hands is the enormous \\nchallenge of limiting the rise in the global temperature to 1.5°c. our united nations of˚ce for human rights has said it clearly: climate change directly and indirectly affects a range of human rights which must be guaranteed. we view with satisfaction that science, governments, business and civil so\\n-ciety are starting to coalesce around concrete targets. thus, little by little, sectoral isolation and arguments are breaking down.it is the path we must insist on. we have a duty to eradicate old and \\nnew forms of inequality and exclusion which every day breach the rights of millions of people living on our planet.it would be a mistake to think that there have not been successes, that injustice in the world has not been driven back. but so long as there is pain and suffering due to inequality, we have a duty to face up to what we are \\ndoing wrong and which we can put right.we have more future than yesterday: this is the invitation that we must \\nall make our own.michelle bachelet jeria united nations high commissioner for human rights26    |

21st century\\n    |    29\\ninequality in human development: moving targets in the 21st centurythis chapter considers two main questions: where do human development inequalities stand today and how are they changing? many inequalities in human development embody unfairness. to see how, take two babies, both born in 2000š\\none in a low human development country, the other in a very high human development country (˚gure˛1.1). what do we \\nknow about their prospects for adult life today? we know that they are vastly different. the ˚rst is very likely to be enrolled \\nin higher education, along with the majority of 20-year-olds in more developed countries today. she or he is preparing to \\nlive in a highly globalized and competitive world and has chances do so as a highly skilled worker.\\nin contrast, the child from the low human \\ndevelopment country is much less likely to be \\nalive. some 17˛percent of children born in low \\nhuman development countries in 2000 will have \\ndied before age 20, compared with just 1˛percent \\nof children born in very high human develop\\n-ment countries. and those who survive have \\nan expected lifespan 13 years shorter than their \\ncounterparts in the group of more developed \\ncountries. ˜e child born in the low human \\ndevelopment country is also unlikely to still \\nbe in education: only 3˛percent are in higher

in this chapter considers inequality \\nof capabilities (box˛1.1).\\nbut what capabilities to consider? sen argued \\nthat one must adjust in response to evolving \\nsocial and economic conditions. for example, \\nin india at the time of independence in 1947, it \\nwas reasonable to concentrate ﬁon elementary \\neducation, basic health, [–] and to not worry \\ntoo much about whether everyone can e˚ec\\n-tively communicate across the country and be\\n-yond.ﬂ\\n7 later, howeveršwith the internet and \\nits applications, as well as broader advances in \\ninformation and communication technologyš\\naccess to the internet and freedom of general \\ncommunication became an important capabil\\n-ity for all indians. whereas one relevant aspect \\nof this insight is strictly linked to capabilities \\n(access to the internet), another intersects with \\nhuman rights and speciˆcally with the right to \\nfreedom of opinion and expression.\\n8 moreover, \\ncapabilities evolve not only with circumstances \\nbut also with values and with people™s changing \\ndemands and aspirations.\\n˜e capabilities approach is thus open-ended, \\nwhich some observers see as a shortcoming.\\n9 one objection is that it does not lend itself to \\nspecifying a standard and ˆxed goal for evalu\\n-ating social welfare because capabilities are con\\n-tinuously moving targets. ˜is report takes a \\ndi˚erent view: it considers that the inequalities \\nwe care about may indeed be moving targets and \\nthus aims to identify patterns and dynamics of \\ninequality in a wider set of capabilities that may \\nbe increasingly relevant during the 21st century.\\nanother challenge is how to measure capa\\n-bilitiesšthat is, how to move from concepts \\nto the empirical assessment of how capabilities \\nare distributed. here the report follows the \\napproach taken when the human development \\nindex (hdi) was introduced and identiˆes a \\nfew observable achieved functionings to capture \\nbroader capabilities (for instance, in the hdi, \\nhaving the option to live a long and healthy life \\nis associated with the indicator of life expectancy \\nbox 1.1inequality of

are people™s freedoms to choose what \\nthey want to be and došregardless of whether they \\nactually make those choices. thus, capabilities are \\nclosely related to the concept of opportunities: it is not \\nenough to know that someone has not travelled to a \\nforeign country; we need to know whether that was a \\nfree choice or whether the person wanted to travel but \\neither could not afford it or was denied entry.\\n3the ˚rst human development reports used the capabilities approach to intervene in the development discourse of the time, when debates centred on ba-sic needs,4 leading to the introduction of the human development index (hdi)šmeasuring the capability to \\nlive a long and healthy life, to acquire knowledge and to earn income for a basic standard of living.5 the hdi was meant to be a metric of a very minimal list of capabili-ties, ﬁgetting at minimally basic quality of life.ﬂ6 it was never a statistic to be maximized, as in aggregate utility. \\nit was computed at the country level, mostly because of data availability, and was meant to enrich the assess\\n-ment of countries™ development performance.7notes\\n1.˛sen (1980) went further than rawls™s social primary commodities, with essentially the same argumentšthat these are, at best, instrumental. 2.˛more precisely, sen \\n(1980) was showing the limitations of utilitarianism as a normative principle to adjudicate welfare. in utilitarianism, social welfare is assessed based on the actual choices \\nthat people make. people are assumed to maximize their individual utilityšan increasing function of income, but one that yields less utility the higher the income. so \\nachieving the ideal social welfare implies maximizing the sum total of utility in a society. that, in turn, can happen only if income is distributed so that individual marginal \\nutility is equalized. sen used a well known and compelling illustration to show how this principle could result in outcomes that violate our sense of fairness. consider \\ntwo individuals: one, who lives with a disability, is not very ef˚cient in turning an additional dollar of income into utility; another, in contrast, derives satisfaction from \\nevery single additional dollar. utilitarianism would dictate giving more income to the second person, an outcome that violates our sense of fairness. 3.˛basu and lopez-\\ncalva 2011. 4.˛stewart,

7.˛perhaps more important, quoting klasen (2018, p.˛2), ﬁmany of the battles of the 1990s that came to de˚ne \\nthe human development reports have been won. today, the entire development community accepts that development is more than increasing per capita gross domestic \\nproduct (gdp).– the hdi has been canonized in all standard textbooks on development economics or development studies – and is considered the most serious and \\ncomprehensive alternative to gdp per capita.

achievements in human development \\nbuild over a person™s life through a sequence of \\nobservable and measurable indicators. initial \\nstepping stones, such as surviving to age 5, learn\\n-ing to read and doing basic math are crucial to \\nfurther development: ˜ese basic achievements \\npresent some of the necessary conditions for cre\\n-ating further capabilities in life.\\n10 ˜e enhanced \\nachievements that follow, such as a long and \\nhealthy adult life or tertiary education, re˙ect \\nmore advanced access to opportunities.\\nwhile these observable achievements are what \\ncan be measured (and compared across countries \\nin a global report), they are taken to represent a \\nwider set of capabilities that also range from ba\\n-sic to enhanced. emphasis should be placed on \\nthe underlying concept of basic and enhanced \\ncapabilities over the specific measurements, \\nwhich can evolve and change from country to \\ncountry. here the inspiration is amartya sen™s \\ndeˆnition of a basic capability as ﬁthe ability to \\nsatisfy certain elementary and crucially impor\\n-tant functionings up to certain levels.ﬂ\\n11 basic \\ncapabilities thus refer to the freedom to make \\nchoices necessary for survival and to avoid or \\nescape poverty or other serious deprivations.\\nthe differentiation between basic and en\\n-hanced capabilities is valid also for other human \\ndevelopment dimensions that are not necessarily \\ntied to an individual lifecyclešfor example, in \\nthe progression from basic to frontier technolo\\n-gies and in the ability to cope with environmental \\nshocks, from perhaps frequent but low-impact \\nevents to large and unpredictable hazards.\\n˜is distinction between basic and enhanced \\ncapabilities resembles the analysis of practical \\nneeds and strategic needs in the context of \\ngender empowerment, pioneered by caroline \\nmoser.\\n12 associated with the distinction is a \\ncautionary message: while investment in basic \\nneeds is essential, to focus on them exclusively \\nis to neglect inequalities in strategic aspects \\nof life, those that change the distribution of \\npower.\\nthus, the next section presents a stylized \\nanalysis along two key dimensions beyond in\\n-come: health and access to knowledgešboth \\ncore dimensions of the human development \\napproach since the ˆrst human development \\nreport. ˜e sequence from basic to enhanced \\ncapabilities can be framed in the context of a li\\n-fecycle analysis (which is also used in chapter˛2 \\nwhen analysing the mechanisms leading up to \\nthe emergence of inequalities in capabilities). \\nlater in the report the same patterns will be \\nillustrated in two other dimensions: human \\nsecurity in the face of shocks linked to trends \\non climate change (chapter˛5) and technology \\n(chapter˛6).\\n13\\n ˜ese drivers of the distribution \\nof capabilities in the 21st century are consid\\n-ered without implying that others, such as \\ndemographic changes, are unimportant or that \\nthey are the only two that matter, but to allow \\nfor a treatable elaboration of the arguments \\nshowing the relevance of analysing the ine\\n-quality dynamics in both basic and enhanced \\ncapabilities.\\nadmittedly, constraining the analysis to these \\nfour dimensions is arbitrary. and in no way \\nshould these aspects be regarded as the most \\nimportant or have any normative meaning. but \\nit is plausible to claim that the distribution and \\nevolution of capabilities across these four dimen\\n-sions will be paramount in determining people™s \\nagency over the 21st centuryšthat is, ﬁthe abil\\n-ity to decide on and the power to achieve what \\nthey want.ﬂ\\n14 ˜ese capabilities, while essential \\nfor agency, are not their sole determinants be\\n-cause human motivations are not driven exclu\\n-sively by improvements in one™s own well-being; \\nﬁpeople™s sense of fairness and concern that they \\nand others be treated fairlyﬂ\\n15 also matter. while \\na full treatment of the implications of these \\nbroader determinants of agency is beyond the \\nscope of the report, this chapter concludes with \\na section that looks at perceptions of inequality \\n(which could indicate how a sense of fairness, or \\nlack thereof, is evolving) as well as some of the \\nsocial and psychological underpinnings of how \\nthese perceptions may emerge and how they \\nconnect with human dignity.\\ndynamics of inequality in human \\ndevelopment: convergence in \\nbasic capabilities, divergence \\nin enhanced

historically been an unequal country in terms \\nof income, with a gini coef˚cient of 0.50 in 2017 (of-˚cial ˚gures from the casen survey). for life expec-tancy at older ages, inequality is signi˚cant as well. \\nin santiago metropolitan region, people living in the \\nwealthier comunas (municipalities) have a higher life \\nexpectancy at age 65šmore than 2 years on average \\n(those at the upper

per\\n-sistent and, indeed, have increased. today, in terms \\nof life expectancy at older ages, there is little overlap \\nbetween the situation of the wealthier comunas and \\nthe rest.there are multiple implications of the divergence in life expectancy at older ages. first, they re˜ect the unevenness of progress in health across the country. \\nadvances in healthy life are taking place, but they are \\nnot reaching all social groups and territories equitably. \\nsecond, there are potentially regressive distributive effects through the pension system, which ties retire-ment bene˚ts to the amount of money accumulated in an individual savings account and to the life expectancy after retirement šthat is currently common across so-cial groups.this example shows the importance of comprehen\\n-sive analysis of inequalities using the human develop-ment lens, going beyond income (assessing the health dimension), beyond averages (looking at disaggregated \\ndata in different

\\nthan imbalances in the distribution of income. \\nin chile, with its very unequal income distri\\n-bution, inequality in income appeared high \\nin the ranking of people™s concerns (53˛per\\n-cent

\\ncriminalize consensual same-sex sexual acts between \\nadults, and at least 38 of them still actively arrest, pros-\\necute and sentence people to prison, corporal punish-\\nment or even death based on these laws.2 moreover, \\nmany un member states also have laws criminalizing \\ndiverse forms of gender expression and cross-dressing, \\nwhich are used to persecute trans and gender-diverse

pathologizing requirements such as \\n\\nsurgeries, invasive treatments/inspections or third-party \\n\\nsubmissions.5 furthermore, when antidiscrimination laws \\ndo not expressly protect people based on their sexual \\n\\norientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex \\n\\ncharacteristics, lgbti people are unable to seek justice \\n\\nagainst acts of discrimination that may prevent them from \\n\\naccessing vital services, including health care, education, \\n\\nhousing and social security, and employment.\\ndiscrimination and violence based on sexual \\norientation, gender

violence against lgbti \\n\\npeople and low rates of prosecution of perpetrators of \\n\\nsuch violence because lgbti people are often isolated \\n\\nfrom state institutions for fear of self-incrimination and \\n\\nfurther abuses.10lack of effective public policy\\nthe third main group of causes of social exclusion of \\nlgbti people has to do with state inaction on public pol\\n-\\nicy issues of sexual and gender diversity.\\n11 as with other social groups that have been subjected to protracted \\ndiscrimination, full social inclusion of lgbti people \\nrequires more than removing discriminatory legislation \\nand enacting legal protections. effective public policies \\n\\ndesigned and implemented to tackle, reduce and even-\\ntually eradicate social prejudice and

\\nbox 1.9a social-psychological perspective on inequalitythis box is grounded in an emerging social-psychological perspective on \\npeople as \\nrelational beings\\n, motivated to regulate their network of social \\nrelationships. this perspective, which moves beyond more individualistic \\nperspectives, suggests that social embeddedness (the experience of social connection within social networks and through group identities) and relative deprivation (the experience of being unfairly worse off than others, based in social comparisons with others) have important consequences.humans are an ultra-social species, with a need to belong. the psycho-logical bonds that individuals develop with others through social interac-tion re˜ect sources of social support and agency and offer targets for social \\ncomparison (subjective assessments of whether others are doing better or worse than oneself).1 this is key to understanding the consequences of ine-quality because a social-psychological perspective focuses on whether and how individuals subjectively perceive and feel about inequality depending on their network of relationships.but even when individuals perceive inequality, they may not perceive \\nit as unfair.\\n2 social networks tend to be homogeneous because individuals tend to self-segregate (ﬁbirds of a feather ˜ock togetherﬂ).3 individuals often compare themselves with those around them, the ones forming a ﬁbubble,ﬂ who are thus likely to af˚rm their opinions about inequality. contact with \\nothersšfor instance, between members of advantaged and disadvantaged groupsšmay increase people™s awareness of inequality,\\n4 but research also suggests that such contact is often characterized by a desire to maintain harmony rather than to discuss the uncomfortable truth of inequality be-tween groups (the ﬂirony of harmonyﬂ).5 as such, social embeddedness of-ten implies a sedative effect when it comes to perceiving inequalityšone cannot act on what one cannot see within one™s bubble.\\n6there is also a motivational explanation for why inequality, even when \\nperceived, is not necessarily perceived as unfair. speci˚cally, individuals can \\nbe motivated to deny or justify the existence of inequality to uphold beliefs about the fairness of the broader system.7 income inequality may be viewed as fair by those who endorse a meritocratic belief system (af˚rming a level \\nplaying ˚eld for everyone). indeed, stereotypes are often used to acknowl-edge inequalities in order to maintain them and thus the broader system in which they are embedded.8against this backdrop, a social-psychological perspective offers an-swers to questions such as why people do or do not act against inequality \\n(such as the gender pay gap) and why they often appear to act irrationally (as in voting for a party that does not protect their interests). such a perspec-tive helps move beyond general correlations in aggregated data (such as be-tween-country indicators of income inequality and public health) and zooms in on the part of the broader relationship that can be explained through such psychological processes as embeddedness and relative deprivation.9a social-psychological perspective of inequality also goes beyond in-come inequality. many health inequalities have social antecedents in vari\\n-ous forms of inequality, including gender, ethnicity and race.\\n10 reference and \\nsocial comparison groups suggest that it is important to know whom people \\ncompare themselves with and thus who is in their network and which group \\nidentities they valuešand which speci˚c forms of inequality they are likely \\nto perceive as unfair and feel relatively deprived in. these psychological di-mensions can be easily lost as the level of analysis and aggregation goes up.\\ntake education. it is not just an objective factor that affords or inhibits \\nopportunities for social mobility. it can also be a potential bubble

when very few people achieve \\na ﬁtargetﬂ (say, access to a new technology), \\ninequality is low: most people perform equally \\npoorly. subsequently, as more people obtain ac\\n-cess, inequality

several \\nmarket economies much earlier in history.\\n1nine market economies, from antiquity to \\nthe modern era, have been identiˆed with cer\\n-tainty, and six of them have su˘cient data to

power of large shares of the pop\\n-ulation, lagging demand and the declining \\nproˆtability of economic investments, owners \\nof large wealth increasingly shi˝ed their in\\n-vestments to ˆnancial markets. ˜ey used their \\nwealth to acquire political leverage through \\npatronage and buying political positions or by \\nacquiring key positions in the ˆscal regime, \\nbureaucracy and finance and through their \\ndominance in ˆnancial markets and their role \\nas creditors of the state. over the course of \\n100œ150 years markets became less open and \\nequitable, through both large wealth owners™ \\neconomic weight and their ability to skew the \\ninstitutional organization of the markets.\\n4 as \\na result, productive investments declined, the \\neconomy started to stagnate and economic \\ninequality rose further, coupled with growing \\npolitical inequity and even coercion.\\neach of the market economies started from \\na very equitable situation, with relatively equal \\ndistribution of economic wealth and political \\ndecisionmaking. ˜is was the result of a long \\npreceding period of smaller and bigger revolts \\nand forms of self-organization of ordinary \\npeoplešin guilds, fraternities, associations, \\ncorporations, commons and companies \\n(figure˛s1.1.1\\n).5 their organization enabled \\nthem to break existing inequities and forms of \\ncoercion and to obtain a more equitable distri\\n-bution of wealth and resources. ˜ey also won \\nthe freedom to exchange their land, labour and \\ncapital without restraints by elite power, thus \\nopening the opportunity to use the market to \\nthis end. ˜eir struggles and forms of self-or\\n-ganization were thus at the base of the rise of \\nfactor marketsšand the rise happened within \\na relatively equal setting, ensuring that large \\ngroups could access the market and benefit \\nfrom market exchange.\\n˜is formative, positive phase was also found \\nin the more familiar, modern cases of market \\neconomies: england, where the market became \\ndominant in the 17th century, and the north\\n-ern united states, in the ˆrst half of the 19th \\ncentury. both were the most equitable societies \\nof the time, with large degrees of freedom, \\ngood access to decisionmaking and relatively \\nequal distribution of land and other forms of \\nwealth.\\n6 market economies were thus not the \\nbase of freedom and equity, as some theories \\nwould have it, but rather developed on the \\nbasis of earlier-won freedom and equity. ˜e \\nmarket subsequently replaced the associations \\nand organizations of ordinary people as the \\nallocation system, a process that sped up when \\nmarket elites and state elites came to overlap \\nand jointly, and o˝en deliberately, marginal\\n-ized these organizations. ˜is reduced ordinary \\npeople™s opportunities to defend freedom, their \\naccess to decisionmaking power and their grip \\nover land and resources.\\n˜e allocation systems that prevailed before \\nthe rise of the market, whether the commons or \\nother associations, had mostly included long-\\nterm security and environmental sustainability \\nin their functioning, as ensured

historical cases where \\nmarkets emerged as the dominant allocation \\nsystem for factors of production (land, labour \\nand capital) all showed an accumulation of \\nwealth in the hands of a small group, which \\nthen also concentrated political power, shaping \\nincentives in markets that increased inequality \\nand environmental calamities. today, even in \\nparliamentary democracies, economic wealth \\nagain seems to be translated into political lev\\n-eragešthrough lobbying, campaign ˆnancing \\nand owning media and informationšwhereas \\nmobile wealth owners can easily isolate them\\n-selves, for say, social disruption or environmen\\n-tal degradation.\\n12 history shows that these \\ndevelopments are not aberrations or accidental \\nevents. and perhaps they require broader and \\ndeeper consideration of a wider range of policy \\nactions to curb the concentration of econom\\n-ic and political power. ˜e concentration of \\neconomic power (wealth), the ˆrst stage, is \\neasiest to curb. but a˝er the establishment of \\neconomic power and its translation to political \\ndominance, this is far harder to do.\\nnotes\\n1 this is true even if the market economy is defined in a very \\nstrict wayšthat is, as an economy where not only goods, \\nproducts and services, but also inputs (land and natural \\nresources, labour and capital) are predominantly allocated by \\nway of the market.2 van bavel 2016. for an analysis of long, cyclical patterns of rising \\nand declining inequality see also turchin and nefedov (2009).\\n3 van bavel 2016 (see pp.˛72œ73 on

interconnected and persistentﬁinequality is not so much a cause of economic, political, and social processes as a consequence. [–] some of the pro\\n-cesses that generate inequality are widely seen as fair. but others are deeply and obviously unfair, and have become a \\nlegitimate source of anger and disaffection.ﬂ1how do the patterns of inequalities in human \\ndevelopment emerge? where are the opportu\\n-nities to redress them? much of the debate on \\nthese questions has centred on the thesis that \\nincome inequality, in and of itself, has detri\\n-mental e˚ects on human development. so re\\n-ducing income inequality\\n   š   primarily through \\nredistribution using taxes and transfers\\n   \\n\\nš would also enhance capabilities and distribute \\nthem more equally.\\nyet, this is far too reductionistic and mech\\n-anistic a formulation of the links between \\nincome inequality and capabilities. as in \\nchapter˛1, it is crucial to go beyond income \\nand lay out the mechanisms through which \\ninequalities in human development emerge\\n  \\n\\nš -\\nand o˝en persist.\\nthis chapter™s approach follows amartya \\nsen™s argument in \\ndevelopment as freedom\\n that addressing deprivations in one dimension \\nnot only has beneˆts in and of itself but can \\nalso support the amelioration of others.\\n2 for \\ninstance, deprivations in housing or nutrition \\nmay hinder health and education outcomes. \\nwhile income is also a factor, deprivations \\nare not necessarily tied to household ability to \\nbuy goods and services in markets. ˜at is the \\nmotivation for the global multidimensional \\npoverty index, the nonmonetary measure \\nof deprivation published in the human \\ndevelopment report since 2010.\\n3 being in \\npoor health and having low education achieve\\n-ments, in turn, can hinder the ability to earn \\nincome or participate in social and political \\nlife. these deprivations can reinforce each \\nother and accumulate over time\\n  \\n\\nš  \\n\\ndriving and \\neven amplifying disparities in capabilities.\\n˜e di˘culty with this approach, however, is \\nsimilar to the one in chapter˛1: where to start?\\nthis chapter addresses the question by \\nfollowing a dual approach. ˜e ˆrst takes a \\nlifecycle perspective, similar to the one that \\ninspired the analysis of capabilities linked \\nto health and education in chapter˛1 (with \\nclimate change and technology addressed at \\nlength in part iii of the report), and considers \\nwhat happens to children from birth, and even \\nbefore birth, and how families, labour markets \\nand public policies shape children™s oppor\\n-tunities.\\n4 parents, through their actions and \\ndecisions, pass on to their children the quali\\n-ties that the labour market values or devalues, \\nexplaining in part how family background \\ndetermines personal income. children™s edu\\n-cation attainment depends on their parents™ \\nsocioeconomic status, which also determines \\nchildren™s health, starting before birth, and \\ncognitive ability, in part through early child\\n-hood stimuli. ˜at status also determines the \\nneighbourhood they grow up in, the schools \\nthey attend and the opportunities they have \\nin the labour market, in part through their \\nknowledge and networks.\\nwhile this lifecycle approach is helpful to \\nilluminate mechanisms at the individual and \\nhousehold levels, the determinants of the \\ndistribution of capabilities cannot be fully \\naccounted for by behaviour at these levels. \\npolicies, institutions, and the rate of growth \\nand change in the structure of the economy, \\namong other factors, also matter a great deal. \\n˜us, the chapter follows a second approach to \\nconsider how income inequality interacts with \\ninstitutions and balances of power, the way soci\\n-eties function and even the nature of economic \\ngrowth. going beyond income does not imply \\nexcluding income inequality. instead, it means \\nthat income inequality should, in the words of \\nangus deaton, not be considered some sort of \\nﬁpollutionﬂ that directly harms human devel\\n-opment outcomes.\\n5 it is crucial to spell out the \\nmechanisms through which income inequality \\nin countries with high income inequality the association between parents™ income and their children™s income \\nis stronger\\n  š  that is, \\nintergenerational income mobility is lowerinteracts with society, with politics and with the \\neconomy in ways that can both beget more ine\\n-qualities and harm human development.\\none example is how income inequality, \\ninstitutions and balances of power co-evolve. \\nwhen elite groups can shape policies that fa\\n-vour themselves and their children, that drives \\nfurther accumulation of income and opportu\\n-nity at the top. high income inequality is thus \\nrelated to lower mobility\\n   š   individuals™ ability \\nto improve their socioeconomic status.\\nintergenerational income mobility\\n   š   the \\nextent to which parents™ income accounts for \\ntheir children™s income\\n   š   is persistently low in \\nsome societies.\\n6 when that happens, the skills \\nand talent in an economy are not necessarily \\nallocated in the most e˘cient way, reducing \\neconomic growth from a counterfactual that \\nallocates resources to earn the greatest returns. \\n˜e point to emphasize is less the precision of \\ncross-country econometric estimates and more \\nthe identiˆcation of a plausible mechanism that \\nruns from high inequality through opportuni\\n-ty (key for human development) to economic \\ngrowth\\n   š   and back.\\n˜e nature of inequalities also matters. for \\nexample, horizontal inequalities\\n   š   which, as \\nhighlighted in chapter˛1, refer to disparities \\namong groups rather than among individuals\\n   \\nš seem to matter for con˙ict. once again, spell\\n-ing out the mechanism is crucial: in this case, \\nhorizontal inequalities not only lead to shared \\ngrievances within a group but can also interact \\nwith political inequality to mobilize collective \\naction for that group to take up arms.\\nhow inequalities begin at \\nbirth\\n   š   and can persist\\nin countries with high income inequality the \\nassociation

inequal\\n-ity (because it is possible to account for the \\nrelationship also in the direction running \\nfrom low mobility to high inequality), as fol\\n-lows: ﬁinequality lowers mobility because it \\nshapes opportunity. it heightens the income \\nconsequences of innate differences between \\nindividuals; it also changes opportunities, in\\n-centives, and institutions that form, develop, \\nand

inequality in opportunity and \\nmobility in education, ˆnding that the share \\nof income inequality that is attributable to \\ncircumstances is higher in countries with lower \\neducation mobility.\\n13 a similar relation was \\nfound between inequality in opportunity and \\nmobility in income.\\n14inequality in opportunity is thus a link be\\n-tween inequality and intergenerational mobil\\n-ity: if higher inequality makes mobility more \\ndi˘cult, it is likely because opportunities for \\nadvancement are more unequally distributed \\namong children. conversely, the way lower \\nmobility may contribute to the persistence of \\ninequalities is by making opportunity sets very \\ndi˚erent among the children of the rich and \\nthe children of the poor.\\n15 ˜ese opportunities \\nnot only a˚ect the level of welfare that will be \\nattained; they also determine the e˚orts that \\nwill have to be invested to achieve certain out\\n-comes.\\n16 a measure of inequality that assesses \\nonly outcomes will thus never be able to fully \\nassess the fairness of a certain allocation of \\nresources.\\n17but relative mobility\\n  \\n   \\nis not alone in being im\\n-portant for human development. without ab\\n-solute mobility, education and income would \\nnot increase from one generation to the next, \\nwhich is important for progress, especially for \\nlow human development countries that need to \\ncatch up in capabilities (see chapter˛1).\\n18as introduced in chapter˛1, a gradient de\\n-scribes how achievements along a dimension \\n(say, health or education) increase with socio\\n-economic status. a vast literature describes how \\ngradients emerge and persist. angus deaton \\ndescribed how health gradients were flat\\n  \\n\\nš with very little di˚erence in health outcomes \\nbetween the rich and the poor\\n  \\n\\nš  \\n\\nuntil health \\ninnovations around the 18th century made it \\npossible for the richest to start having access \\nto health technologies: ﬁpower and money are \\nuseless against the force of mortality without \\nweapons to ˆght it.ﬂ\\n19 in the second half of the \\n19th century health gradients were carefully \\ndocumented in britain and elsewhere, with \\ntheir persistence remaining an enduring area of \\npolicy and academic debate.\\n20how do health and education gradients \\nevolve to opportunity? some interactions \\ncan describe what happens over the lifecycle \\n(ˆgure˛2.2).\\na key channel for a potential vicious cycle of \\nlow mobility is an education loop. education \\nmobilizes individuals to improve their lot, \\nbut when low education is passed on from \\nparents to children, those opportunities for \\nimprovement are not fully seized. to break the \\ncycle requires understanding how these loops \\noperate, pointing to opportunities for interven\\n-tions, considered in the next section. another \\nsigniˆcant loop relates to health status, starting \\nat birth and evolving through life depending \\non family choices and health policies.\\n21 ˜e \\nunequal distribution of health conditions can \\ncontribute to inequalities in other areas of life, \\nsuch as education and the possibility to gener\\n-ate income.\\n22 ˜e relation also goes the other \\nway, with health gradients in income suggesting \\nthat higher income ﬁprotectsﬂ health, which in \\nturn enables people to be less prone to losing \\nincome as a result of being sick (with a vicious \\ncycle in reverse potentially happening to those \\nwith lower income).\\ninequalities in key areas of human devel\\n-opment are thus interconnected and can be \\npersistent from one generation to the next. \\nmany aspects of children™s outcomes can be \\ncarried through to other stages of the lifecycle, \\nwhere they a˚ect adults™ ability to generate \\nincome. ˜e resulting socioeconomic status \\nshapes mating behaviours among adults.\\n23 people with a certain income and education \\ntend to marry

participation \\nin early childhood development programmes, \\neven before preprimary education, has the po\\n-tential to reduce inequality in education as well \\nas increase education mobility.\\nin many lower human development countries \\nunequal early childhood stimuli are not the \\nonly barrier to mobility in education. children \\nfrom lower socioeconomic status families may \\nbe unable to attend school because they have \\nduties around the house or on the farm or be\\n-cause they need to earn income for the family.\\n34 but even if all children had the same grade at\\n-tainment, the gap in universal numeracy would \\nclose by only 8˛percent in india and 25˛percent \\nin pakistan, and the gap in universal literacy \\nwould close by only 8˛percent in uganda and \\n28˛percent in

for both children. children from \\nthe poorest 40˛percent of households usually \\nshow lower abilities in numeracy and literacy \\nat each grade. if these children had the same \\nlearning

to \\nexpanding access to education, gaps in learning \\nability have to be reduced, the earlier the better, \\nas the example from germany shows.\\nearly childhood stimuli are not the only \\nadvantage children from high socioeconomic \\nstatus families have. even if they perform poor\\n-ly in school, they are still much more likely to \\nmove on to higher education, as evidenced in

school \\nand thus give them a second chance.\\n37another potential source of divergence is so\\n-cial and emotional learning, which is critical for \\ncreating productive adults (box˛2.1).\\n38 social \\nand emotional learning is conducive not only \\nfor productivity but also for peaceful social in\\n-teraction in cohesive societies.\\n39 modern forms \\nof education increasingly take such learning \\ninto account when designing curricula, but it is \\nan additional challenge for many low and me\\n-dium human development countries that are \\nundertaking substantial e˚orts to provide

achievement. policies geared to \\nraising people above a ˙oor fail to boost young \\npeople™s opportunities to move on to higher \\neducation. interventions thus need to consider \\nboth how to finish closing the gap in basic \\neducation achievements and how to stem the \\npersistentšor even the increasingšdivergence\\n \\n  \\nin more advanced education achievements.\\n˜e e˚ect of the gradient is also carried on \\nto the labour market. someone with high \\nsocioeconomic status but low ˆnal education \\nattainment\\n \\nš \\nsuch as a member of a privileged \\nfamily who lacks a

and income and wealth in\\n-equality. sustained economic growth typically \\nhappens with structural shi˝s in the economy \\n(with employment and value added moving \\nfrom agriculture to both manufacturing and \\nservices). but the relation with income distri\\n-bution is more ambiguous. simon kuznets \\nwas the ˆrst to take up the issue systematical\\n-ly, putting forward the hypothesis that with \\neconomic growth, as labour moved away from \\nthe agricultural and rural sector to nonagri\\n-cultural and urban economic activities (with a \\nhigher mean wage than agriculture and a more \\nwidespread distribution of earnings), there \\nwould be two stages in the evolution of overall \\nincome distribution.\\n55 during the initial stage \\neconomywide inequality would increase with \\neconomic growth as the relative weight of the \\nnonagricultural sector expanded from very \\nlow levels. but as the share of labour in the ag\\n-ricultural sector shrank, a tipping point would \\neventually be reached, and inequality would \\nstart to fall (given the very low weight of the \\nagricultural and rural sector).\\nwhat came to be known as the kuznets hy\\n-pothesis thus predicted an inverse-u relation \\n(or curve) between income levels and income \\ninequality, with structural change as the main \\nmechanism accounting for the relation. ˜is \\nbecame the most enduring legacy of simon \\nkuznets™s 1955 article, but it was by no means \\nthe only contribution of that work.\\nsimon kuznets analysed other mechanisms \\nthat he thought in˙uenced the interplay among \\ngrowth, structural change and inequality. ˜ese \\nranged from demographic changes (includ\\n-ing the economic paths of immigrants into \\nfast-growing modernizing economies) to the \\nin˙uence of political processes in determining \\nthe distribution of income: ﬁin democratic \\nsocieties the growing political power of the \\nurban lower-income groups led to a variety of \\nprotective and supporting legislation, much \\nof it aimed to counteract the worst e˚ects of \\nrapid industrialization and urbanization and \\nto support the claims of the broad masses for \\nmore

does not \\nseem to account fully for more recent develop\\n-ments in labour markets this century.\\nrather than a steep gradient, many labour \\nmarkets in developed economies have polar\\n-ized. ˜is polarization is sometimes manifested \\nwith an increase in the labour shares both at the \\nbottom and the top of the skill distribution and \\na hollowing out at the middle.\\n61 jan tinbergen™s \\nrace model, therefore, needs to be adjusted to \\naccount for wage growth at the bottom\\n \\nš assuming that the same mechanism can explain \\neither wage increases or gains in employment \\nshares at the top. a large literature has emerged \\nto account for job polarization, premised on \\nthe concept that not only technology but also \\nother factors\\n š including trade\\n š determine the \\ndemand for skills.\\n˜e most in˙uential approach in this ˆeld \\nconsiders tasks and assesses the extent to which \\nthey can be easily replaced by either technolo\\n-gy or globalization (with production moving \\nto lower labour cost economies). with this \\nframework, some tasks that are nonroutine \\n(thus di˘cult to automate) and more immune \\nto globalization (nontradable, in more techni\\n-cal terms, such as personal and social care, for \\ninstance) can be in high demand, even if they \\ncorrespond to low skills.\\n62 it is in the middle \\nof the skill distribution, with several tasks in \\nthe manufacturing sector, that there is higher \\nvulnerability to o˚shoring or technology re\\n-placement, which explains the hollowing out of \\nthe middle.\\n63 ˜ese factors seem to be at play in \\nsome developing countries as well.\\n64\\n over the \\ncourse of this century there has been a hollow\\n-ing out of the middle, in this case measured

˜is is \\nat the heart of ˜omas piketty™s critique of the \\nkuznets hypothesis, which argues that inequal\\n-ity dynamics depend primarily on institutions \\nand policies.\\n69 and walter scheidel

\\nconcerns with efficiency, or how much in\\n-come is growing, have traditionally dominated \\nconcerns with equity, or how it is distributed. \\narthur okun has suggested a tradeo˚ between \\neconomic efficiency and equality, arguing \\nthat more equality could weaken economic \\ngrowth by harming incentives to work, save \\nand invest.\\n71 and because income growth has \\nsuch an overwhelming impact over the longer \\nrun in improving living standards, the impact \\nof redistributing production would pale in \\ncomparison with the ﬁapparently limitless \\npotential of increasing production.ﬂ\\n72 yet re\\n-cent empirical studies have found that higher \\nincome inequality can be associated with \\nlower and less durable growth,\\n73 including in \\ndeveloping countries.\\n74 but both the data and \\ntechniques used in some of these econometric \\nstudies remain contested, casting a shadow of \\nuncertainty over claims that inequality is either \\nﬁbadﬂ or ﬁgoodﬂ for economic growth.\\n75ultimately, it is less relevant to explore \\nwhether inequality is harmful to growth (in \\na mechanistic way) than to understand the \\nimpact of policies on income distribution and \\neconomic growth.\\n76 and the evaluation of the \\nimpact of policies on distribution, in turn, \\ndepends on the weights that society and poli\\n-cymakers attribute to di˚erent segments of the \\npopulation. ˜us, blanket statements on the \\ne˚ect of inequality on growth are not helpful, \\nin part because they do not enable insights into \\nwhether income is accruing to the middle class \\nor to the bottom of the distribution. moreover, \\nsince at least simon kuznets™s 1955 article, it \\nhas been well understood that growth processes \\ncan at times be unequalizing. what matters is \\nto identify policies that can lead both to growth \\nand to more inclusive sharing of the gains from \\nexpanding income.\\nidentifying these more inclusive growth \\npatterns matters in particular for those at the \\nbottom of the income distribution. in this \\ncase, the redistribution of productive capacity \\n(leading to the accumulation of assets, access \\nto markets and connection of returns to asset \\nuse at the bottom) can lead to both growth \\nand income gains at the bottom, reducing in\\n-equality.\\n77 more mechanically, interactions be\\n-tween growth and inequality a˚ect how much \\nincome ˙ows to poor people.\\n78 as a matter of \\npure arithmetic decomposition, the impact of \\nexpanding mean income on poverty depends \\non the growth rate as well

\\nit can change the pov\\n-erty elasticity of income, which would make \\ngrowth more impactful on poverty reduction \\nover time.\\n80 a recent simulation exercise \\nquantiˆes how reducing inequality could help \\nreduce poverty using those direct relationships. \\n˜e number of extremely poor people would \\nremain above 550˛million in 2030 if gdp per \\ncapita were to grow according to

5˛percent in 2030, \\nwhich would bring 100˛million more people \\nout of extreme poverty.\\n 81in the spirit of understanding further pos\\n-sible mechanisms for the interaction between \\ninequality and growth, one hypothesis is that \\nif high inequality reduces mobility, that would \\nlead to an ine˘cient allocation of resources \\n(talent, skills and capital) that, compared with \\na counterfactual in which the resources are \\nallocated e˘ciently, would hurt growth. if this \\nmechanism holds, there would be a negative im\\n-pact of income inequality on economic growth, \\nwith

interactions, which can diminish trust and social cohesionin opportunity.\\n82 yet, once again, the empirical \\nsupport for this channel is ambiguous.\\n83another hypothesis is that the relation \\nworks through efficiency: productivity, and \\nhence gdp, increase most when resources are \\ne˘ciently used and the potential for technolog\\n-ical learning is fully exploited.\\n84 ˜is has been

in most countries with high income \\ninequality than in countries with low in\\n-come inequality.\\n86 one reason could be that \\ninequality reduces incentives for innovation \\nand investment through various supply-side \\nmechanisms.\\n87˜e relation could also work in reverse: slow \\neconomic growth could increase inequality \\nunder certain circumstances. for instance, \\nwhen rates of return are higher than economic \\ngrowth, especially for large wealth portfolios, \\nwealth inequality tends to increase.\\n88 together \\nwith other mechanisms contributing to the rise \\nof top-end bargaining power and high incomes \\n(including top executive compensation), this \\ndynamic could create a vicious circle of slow \\ngrowth and high inequality.\\ntrust and social interaction \\nin unequal societies\\nincome inequality can damage social cohesion \\nin societies. trust, solidarity and social interac\\n-tion can be diminished by large income gaps, \\nimpairing the social contract (sets of rules and \\nexpectations of behaviour with which people \\nvoluntarily conform that underpin stable \\nsocieties). but does income inequality simply \\ndamage social cohesion, or is the relation two-\\nway\\n \\nš \\ndoes low social cohesion block redistrib\\n-utive policies?\\nimportant features of social cohesion include \\nthe strength of social relationships, shared \\nvalues, feelings of identity and the sense of \\nbelonging to a certain community.\\n89 one of \\nthe most common measures of social cohesion \\nis the level of trust among society. trusting \\npeople means accepting strangers as part of the \\ncommunity and sharing with them the under\\n-lying commonality of values. trust is based on \\nsenses of optimism and control: putting faith \\nin strangers is not seen as risky.\\n90 but higher \\ninequality may cause the less wealthy to feel \\npowerless and less trusting in a society generally \\nperceived as unfair, while people at the top may \\nnot feel that they share the same fate as people \\nat the bottom or that they should strive towards \\na common goal.\\n91empirical evidence shows that in developed \\ncountries the higher the income inequality, the \\nlower the level of trust within society.\\n92 and \\nin european countries with higher income \\ninequality, people are less willing to improve \\nthe living conditions of others, independent of \\nhousehold income, while there is probably less \\nsolidarity and people are less likely to support \\nredistributive institutions.\\n93 the interaction \\nbetween inequalities and solidarity may thus go \\nin both directions.\\nwhen horizontal inequalities are high, or \\nperceived to be high, people may withdraw \\nfrom certain social interactions (box˛2.3), which \\ncan also diminish trust and social cohesion.\\n94 in \\nhighly unequal countries people from di˚er\\n-ent social strands are also less likely to mingle \\nand interact.\\n95 ˜ey probably live in di˚erent

perceived inequalities in south africasouth africa is an interesting case study of social cohe-sion and inequalities, given its history of racial segre-gation and related vertical and horizontal inequalities. according to multidimensional living standards meas\\n-ures, inequality has declined signi˚cantly among indi-viduals and among races since 2008. and yet interracial interactionsšmeasured by actual interracial social in-teractions, the desire to interact and the desire to know about the customs of people of other racesšhave also \\ndeclined since 2010. while interracial interaction is just \\none part of social cohesion, it is crucial in south africa. these ˚ndings are thus counterintuitive and run contrary to the empirical ˚ndings of other countries.one possible explanation is that perceived trends in \\ninequality, which are substantially different from actu\\n-al trends, are more important for predicting interracial \\nsocialization. the roughly 70˛percent of south africans \\nwho feel that inequality has not changed much or has \\neven increased over time are less likely to participate \\nin interracial socialization than those who perceive \\nthat inequality is declining. across race groups, interra-cial socialization and the desire to interact increase as \\nperceived inequality declines (see ˚gure). the desire to \\ninteract is crucial here, as it varies from the actual inter-actions due to circumstances. the ˚nding remains sig-ni˚cant even after a multidimensional living standards \\nmeasure, race, education, trust and other measures are \\ncontrolled for.\\nthese ˚ndings are important because interracial \\ninteraction is crucial for social cohesion in south africa. social cohesion in turn increases the possibility of con\\n-sensus on equalizing policies that reduce inequality. \\nthere is also weak evidence for reduced objective ine\\n-quality improving social cohesion. this opens an oppor-tunity to create a virtuous cycle of social cohesion and low inequalities.more interracial interaction with lower perceived inequalities020406080white      asian/indian      coloured

agents™ individual movements give rise to an aggregate segregation of around 86˛percent (in other words, roughly 86˛percent of one™s neighbours \\nend up being the same colour despite each person wishing to have a 50˛per\\n-cent level of diversity). reducing the preference to 40˛percent results in the \\noverall rate of segregation dropping to around 83˛percent; reducing it to \\n30˛percent brings segregation down to about 75˛percent (see ˚gure).\\n4 only lowering the preference to the single digits results in very low emergent segregation (for example, 9˛percent leads to 52˛percent). this means that \\npeople of similar ethnic characteristics automatically move closer together. \\nthese behavioural patterns can accelerate inequalities due to the power \\nof the neighbourhood effectšan expression used to describe the impact of neighbourhood on the possibility of an individual moving up the social \\nladder, especially through the in˜uence of peers and role models. in most \\ndeveloping countries neighbourhood effects are likely to be even stronger given the vast differences in the provision of public goods and services, es\\n-pecially between rural and urban areas.5however, public policy interventions can help shape human behaviour, \\nproviding counterincentives to mitigate the power of the neighbourhood ef-fect. in the united states inequality in housing prices limits workers™ ability to move to a location with higher earning potential.6 similarly, the quality \\nof public services such as schools can differ across neighbourhoods, fur-ther heightening inequalities. government subsidies for housing or equal-ly good quality public schools could help offset this effect. the moving to opportunity experiment showed the effectiveness of these policies by of-fering randomly selected families housing vouchers to move into better off neighbourhoods. the move increased college attendance and earnings for people who moved during childhood.7how

backgrounds. likewise, it \\ncan teach norms and values and promote par\\n-ticipatory and active citizenship. but schools \\ncan also act as a ˙attener for the health gradi\\n-ent, teaching children healthy habits and how \\nto follow a balanced and nutritious diet.\\n101 ˜e convergence in primary and secondary educa\\n-tion (see chapter˛1) thus gives hope for creating \\nvirtuous cycles of equity in the future.\\nhow inequalities are transferred \\ninto political inequality\\n \\nš \\nand back\\nmost of the literature has found that in high hu\\n-man development countries inequalities depress \\npolitical participation, speciˆcally the frequency \\nof political discussion and participation in \\nelections among all citizens but the richest.\\n102 economic elites (or sometimes even the upper \\nmiddle class) and organized groups representing \\nbusiness interests thus shape policies substantially \\nmore than average citizens or mass-based interest \\ngroups do. additionally, mechanisms through \\nwhich this can happen include opinion making, \\nlobbying and clientelism.\\n103 income and wealth \\ninequalities are thus transferred into political ine\\n-quality (box˛2.5), with privileged groups mould\\n-ing the system according to their needs and \\npreferences, leading to even more inequalities. \\ngovernment policy space to address inequalities \\nbecomes constrained because political decisions \\nre˙ect the balance of power in society. ˜is is \\no˝en referred to as elite capture of institutions.\\n104power asymmetries can even lead to break\\n-downs in institutional functions, constraining \\nthe e˚ectiveness of policies. when institutions \\nare afflicted by clientelism and captured by \\nelites, citizens may be less willing to cooperate \\non social contracts. when that translates into, \\nfor instance, lower compliance with paying tax\\n-es, the state™s ability to provide quality public \\nservices is diminished. ˜is, in turn can lead to \\nhigher and more persistent inequalitiesšfor \\ninstance, in health and education. as the overall \\nsystem will be perceived as unfair, people tend \\nto withdraw from political processes, which \\nfurther strengthens the in˙uence of elites.\\n105in a world in which information becomes \\nmore and more accessible and important, \\nmedia is a decisive channel through which the \\nimbalances of power can be further ampliˆed. \\ndifferent stakeholders ﬁcreate, tap, or steer \\ninformation ˙ows in ways that suit their goals \\nand in ways that modify, enable, or disable \\nthe agency of others, across and between a \\nrange of older and newer media settings.ﬂ\\n106 even though information is easily accessible \\nfor many people, not everyone is equally well \\ninformed. in countries with high internet pen\\n-etration, income inequality correlates positively \\nwith both information inequality (measured \\nby the gini coefficient estimated over the \\nnumber of news sources individuals use) and \\ninformation poverty (the probability of using \\nzero or only one news source). in australia, \\nthe united kingdom and the united states, \\nwhere income and information inequality are \\nhigh, 1 individual in 10 uses zero or only one \\nnews source (information poverty).\\n107 less well \\ninformed voters become more susceptible to \\nthe above described political in˙uence by the \\nfew media sources they consume. depending \\non how these sources are ˆnanced, they may \\npromote and protect the interests of a speciˆc \\ngroup. ˜is form of biased reporting has

2.5economic inequality and human development elizabeth anderson, arthur f. thurnau professor and john dewey\\ndistinguished university professor of philosophy and women™s studies at the university of michigan\\nhow does inequality matter for human development? it limits the prospects for development of the less advantaged. it undermines the ability of untar-geted pro-growth policies to reduce poverty because most of the growth will be appropriated by the better-off. and it reduces social mobility by enabling \\nadvantaged groups to hoard opportunities and close ranks against those beneath them.beyond these concerns, political theorists have drawn attention to the relational aspects of inequality, beyond the bare facts of distributive ine\\n-quality: distributive inequalities re˜ect, reproduce and sometimes consti\\n-tute oppressive social relations of domination, esteem and standing.1 it is not simply the material injury of wage theft or of being physically beaten by \\na domestic partner but the fact of living in subjection to others who wield the power to in˜ict harm with impunity and who feel free to sacri˚ce one™s \\nvital interests to their own greed or vanity that not only deprives but also oppresses. it is not simply the bare fact of lacking adequate clothing but the stigma others attach to such deprivation that makes poverty sting. it is not simply the physical dif˚culty the disabled have of navigating public spaces but also the little account public architects and public policy have given to their interests that not only inconveniences but constitutes their diminished standing in the eyes of others.across the world, inequality tracks differences of social identity such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion, caste, class and sexual orientationš\\narbitrarily marking some social groups as superior to others in the oppor\\n-tunities they enjoy, the powers they command and the respect others owe \\nthem. under such conditions members of subordinated groups lack effective means to vindicate their human rights, even in states that legally acknowl\\n-edge these rights. groups targeted for sexual harassment and assault can-not vindicate their rights if social or legal norms systematically disparage the credibility of their testimony. groups subject to disproportionate siting \\nof toxic waste dumps and polluting industries cannot vindicate their rights if they are disenfranchised or if state decisionmakers are otherwise unac\\n-countable to them. groups denied effective access to education cannot vin\\n-dicate their rights if they do not know what their rights are or lack the ability to navigate the judicial and bureaucratic processes needed to secure them.distributive inequality for social relations undermines trust among members of society as well as trust in institutions. it depresses political, civ-ic, social and cultural participation. it spurs communal violence and crime. it undermines democracy by enabling the rich to capture the state and thereby appropriate a disproportionate share of public goods, shift tax burdens in \\na regressive direction, enforce ˚scal austerity and avoid accountability for \\npredatory and criminal behaviour. even the laws and regulations that consti\\n-tute the basic economic infrastructure of markets, property and ˚rms have been designed under the in˜uence of powerful groups to rig purportedly neutral rules in their interests.2these effects occur in states at all levels of human development, even \\nthose with low poverty. they are exacerbated by extreme inequalities in the \\ntop 1˛percent of income and wealth distributions\\n3 as well as by a small or stagnant middle class.the independent normative signi˚cance of inequality suggests that abolishing poverty and deprivation should not be the only aim; the concen-tration of income and wealth at the top should also be limited.4 in 2019 the richest 26 individuals in the world owned as much wealth as the bottom half of the world™s population.\\n5 there is no normative justi˚cation for such extreme inequality. the wealth of the ultra-rich has not always been accu\\n-mulated legallyšgiven the vast scale of global corruption, organized crime, \\n˚nancial manipulation, money laundering and tax evasion. but even when it has, that would only call into question the justi˚cation of laws so heavily tilted towards the interests of the rich. it is absurd to credit such inequality to differences in merit, given the rising capital share of income, which re-wards mere ownership, and the large impact of chance on outcomes. nor can such extreme inequality be rationalized as necessary for poverty reduc-tion or as socially advantageous in any other way. extreme wealth does not \\neven enhance the consumption possibilities of the ultra-rich, who cannot personally consume all of their wealth or even a signi˚cant fraction of it.indeed, most of what the ultra-rich do with their wealth is exercise power over others. if they own, direct or manage a ˚rm, they deploy their wealth to control their workers and their working conditions. if they hold a \\nmonopoly or monopsony position, they may dominate consumers, suppliers and the communities where they operate. if they lobby or donate money to politicians, they capture the state. the ultra-rich also have disproportionate clout in global institutions, particularly regarding the rules of global ˚nance, which have contributed to systemic ˚nancial risks and to the instability ex\\n-perienced by many countries around the world.the current era is witnessing global democratic backsliding, following a surge of democratization in the 1990s and early 2000s. freedom house reports that 22 of 41 democracies have become less free in the last ˚ve years.6 while the causal connections between distributive inequality (in\\n-cluding extreme concentrations of wealth at the top and declining prospects for the global middle) and the decay of democratic norms and institutions have yet to be fully explored, what is already known should raise alarms. while the ultra-rich might escape the worst of unmitigated global climate \\nchange, what will happen to the billions left homeless, sick or stateless \\nby rising sea levels, extreme ˜oods, droughts, heat waves and attendant social con˜ict and civil war? the great inequalities de˚ned by citizenship status threaten the freedom of environmental and wartime refugees, while politicians in receiving states attack democratic institutions in the name of closing their borders. just at the point where meeting the challenges of \\nclimate change is demanding ever-greater international cooperation, states \\nare retreating from global institutions. greater attention to the case for equality, both within and between states and in the governance of global \\ninstitutions, is needed to promote human development and cope with the \\ngreatest challenge humanity faces in the 21st century.\\nnotes\\n1.˛anderson 1999; fourie, schuppert and wallimann-helmer 2015. 2.˛harcourt 2011; pistor 2019. 3.˛piketty 2014. 4.˛robeyns 2019. 5.˛oxfam 2019. 6.˛freedom house 2019.\\nchapter 2\\n

way in which di˚erent actors in society \\nbargain to reach agreements (policies and \\nrules). when these agreements take the form of \\npolicies, they have the power to directly impact \\nthe distribution of resources in society (the \\nbottom arrow in the right loop of ˆgure˛2.7, \\nﬁoutcome gameﬂ). for example, policies on tax\\n-ation and social spending determine who pays \\ninto the ˆscal system and who beneˆts from it. \\n˜ese policies directly in˙uence development \\noutcomes such as economic inequality (and \\ngrowth). however, by redistributing economic \\nresources, these policies are also redistributing \\nde facto power (the top arrow in the right loop \\nof ˆgure˛2.7). ˜is can generate (or reinforce) \\npower asymmetries between actors bargaining \\nin the policy arena, which can in turn adversely \\na˚ect the e˚ective implementation of devel\\n-opment policies. for example, power asym\\n-metries can manifest in the capture of policies \\nby elite actorsšundermining the ability of \\ngovernments to commit to achieving long-term \\ngoals. or they may manifest in the exclusion \\nof certain population groups from accessing \\nhigh-quality public servicesšundermining \\ncooperation by harming tax morale. ˜is can \\nlead to a vicious cycle of inequality (inequality \\ntraps) in which unequal societies begin to insti\\n-tutionalize the

inequalities and homicides \\nand violent con˙ict. ˜ere are more homicides \\nin countries with higher income inequality \\nacross all categories of human development. \\nfor high and very high human

\\nviolence.\\n120 others ˆnd no relation between \\nincome inequality and violent conflict.\\n121 more recently, frances stewart has argued \\nthat political disturbances\\n š \\nincluding violent \\ncon˙ict and civil war\\n \\nš \\narise from horizontal \\ninequalities between different groups, each \\ndistinguishing itself from the others by its his\\n-tory, religion, language, race, region,

by politically ex\\n-cluding certain groups.\\n123a condition for horizontal inequalities to \\nlead to con˙ict is that leaders or elites have \\nan interest in mobilizing groups and initiat\\n-ing a con˙ict. ˜at interest o˝en arises from \\nhorizontal political inequalities among the \\nelite.\\n124 added to this are more determinants \\nof con˙ict: the nature of the state, the role \\nof local

\\ninequalities and contribute to outbreaks of \\ninstability. one example is the contribution \\nof the drought that a˚ected syria prior to the \\nuprisings of 2011, showing how shocks and \\nhorizontal inequalities (primarily between the \\nrural population a˚ected by the drought and \\nthe population in urban areas) can interact to \\ntrigger instability.\\n127while only 9˛percent of

\\ncan reduce horizontal inequalities,1 while in others it can \\nexacerbate them. first, if the costs of internal con˜ict are \\ngreatest for those who are already poorest,2 horizontal in-equalities may increase. many countries and areas expe-riencing armed con˜icts had high horizontal inequalities \\nprior to the con˜ict, and such inequalities are exacerbat\\n-ed when the most disadvantaged groups are dispropor-tionately affected by it. second, internal armed con˜ict is \\noften restricted to or focused largely in certain areas of a \\ncountry. these areas, and the groups that reside in them, \\nmay be cut off from the rest of society and the economy. \\nsome areas will also suffer disproportionally from the de-struction of facilities, buildings and human lives.in the postcon˜ict

starts with good meas\\n-urement and good data. indeed, a major weak\\n-ness of today™s public discourse on inequality \\nis its reliance on summary measures, whose \\nchoice is far from trivial (see spotlight˛3.2 at \\nthe end of chapter˛3). ˜is is not an academic \\nissuešit is critical for policy.\\nconventional summary measures of inequal\\n-ity can fail to identify what truly concerns peo\\n-ple about the distribution of income, wealth \\nand other human development outcomes. for \\ninstance, income share ratios are insensitive to \\nregressive transfers within the poor (as noted \\nin spotlight˛3.1), a matter of importance for \\npolicymaking. income inequality is often \\ndescribed using the gini coefficient. true, \\nthe gini coe˘cient is sensitive to regressive \\ntransfers throughout the distribution and is \\nfrequently used in this reportšas it is in pol\\n-icy and much of the inequality research. but \\nit may not fully express what is of concern to \\npeople and so may need to be complemented \\nwith more information.\\nin fact, summary measures of inequality are \\nsensitive to di˚erent parts of the distribution. \\nevery summary measure implies judgements \\nabout how much to value the income shares of \\npoorer and richer people. sometimes these are \\ncalled ﬁweightsﬂ in a social welfare function. \\neach summary statistic assigns these weights \\nimplicitlyšand, for most people, not that \\ntransparently. some may even be using social \\nweights that do not re˙ect social values. tony \\natkinson, writing in the late 1960s, asserted: \\nﬁ[in examining] the problem of measuring in\\n-equality [–] at present this problem is usually \\napproached through the use of such summary \\nstatistics as the gini coe˘cient [–]. ˜is con\\n-ventional method of approach is misleading \\n[because the] examination of the social welfare \\nfunctions implicit in these measures shows \\nthat in a number of cases they have proper\\n-ties which are unlikely to be acceptable, and \\nin general there are no grounds for believing \\nthat they would accord with social values. [–] \\ni hope that these conventional measures will \\nbe rejected.ﬂ\\n6 in other words, the concept of \\ninequality one uses, and its implied ethical \\njudgements, will determine the conclusion one \\nreaches about it.\\n7as it happens, the gini coe˘cient is more \\nsensitive to transfers of income in the middle \\nof the distribution than at the bottom or the \\ntopšwhile in many countries most of the \\naction on income and wealth dynamics is \\nprecisely at the ends of the distribution (chap\\n-ter˛3). in particular, much of the inequality \\naction occurs at the very top, so that measures \\nlooking at the top 10˛percentševen, in some \\ncases, the top 1˛percentšlack the resolution to \\nfully capture the accumulation of income and \\nwealth.\\nin addition, concepts and measurement in\\n-teract, each shaping how the other evolves. it is \\nhistorically inaccurate to assume that the com\\n-plete axiomatic foundation of all inequality \\nmeasures was developed before these measures \\nwere used. ˜e human development index, \\nwhich human development reports issue \\nregularly, is a good illustration. as amartya \\nsen said, it was introduced as a ﬁrough and \\nreadyﬂ measure of basic capabilities, and several \\naspects of itšincluding changes introduced \\nover the yearsšremain controversial.\\n8 but the \\nsame can be said of national accounts estimates \\nand the origin of macroeconomic aggregates \\nsuch as gross domestic product (gdp). in \\nthe ediˆce of statistical manuals agreed to by \\nthe united nations statistical commission, \\nnational accounts may seem an unassailable \\nconstructionšbut they are no more than just \\nthat: a construction.\\ntracing the history of national accounts and \\ngdp, diane coyle recounts the 1940s debate \\nin the united states on whether to include \\ngovernment spending in gdp.\\n9 ˜e commerce \\ndepartment at the time argued that govern\\n-ment spending should be included. but a \\nfounding father of gdp measurement, simon \\nkuznets, argued for leaving it out (partly be\\n-cause he viewed some government spending as \\nnot necessarily enhancing welfare). ultimately, \\ncoyle argues, the decision to include it had \\nprofound implications for the government™s \\nperceived role in the economy as another agent \\nalongside private actors (the same approach \\nadvocated by john maynard keynes). hugh \\nrocko˚ goes further, showing how economic \\nstatistics such as price indices and unemploy\\n-ment rates originated ﬁin bitter debates over \\neconomic policy, ultimately debates over the \\ndistribution of income.ﬂ\\n10clearly, measurement in˙uences policy. yet \\nthe issue is more complex that just measure\\n-ment. it is one thing to agree to look beyond \\nsummary measures of income inequality, and \\nanother to have the data to do this. to be \\nsure, summary measures are constructed from \\ninformation on the very distribution that \\nthey collapse into a single summary statistic, \\nalthough the data on that distribution are \\no˝en too coarse. ˜anks to innovative e˚orts \\ncombining information from various sources \\non income and wealth distribution, however, \\nit is now feasible to estimate at a more gran\\n-ular level how income is distributed and how \\nthis distribution changes over time for various \\npopulation segments. meeting the growing de\\n-mand for comparable cross-country inequality \\nestimates, a number of databases with regional \\nor global coverage provide estimates for a range \\nof countries and years. although there is much \\nagreement across di˚erent databases, there are \\ndi˚erences across the concepts of income that \\nare used, with important implications for con\\n-clusions, such as the extent to which ˆscal re\\n-distribution a˚ects inequality (see spotlight˛3.3 \\nat the end of chapter˛3).\\n11to go beyond averages, part˛ii has two \\nchapters. chapter 3 presents recent ˆndings \\non inequality levels and trends in global pre\\n-tax incomes and wealth, pointing out that, as \\nthings stand, the wealthiest 1˛percent of the \\npopulation is on track to capture 35˛percent of \\nglobal wealth by 2030. ˜e chapter breaks out \\nthese trends across regions, using recent data \\nand new methods to survey income inequali\\n-ty. it then delves into the dynamics of wealth \\nconcentration.\\n˜e use of innovative methods to account for \\nthe evolution of income and wealth inequality \\nacross the distribution has captured previously \\nhidden patterns of accumulation at the very top \\nin many countries. ˜e drivers of this accumu\\n-lation need to be understood in depth and are \\nlikely to vary by country. (for instance, recent \\nanalysis has shown that the typical top earners \\nin the united states derive their high incomes \\nfrom founding or managing their businesses \\nrather than from ˆnancial capital).\\n12 ˜e inno\\n-vative methods in this chapter are still evolving, \\nrequiring assumptions that are contested in the \\nliterature.\\n13chapter˛3 is transparent about assumptions \\nand decisions in dealing with data challenges \\nto encourage the type of scrutiny that, over \\ntime, will improve data and information on \\ninequality. it bears recalling that even the \\nbest-established economic statistics have \\nsome uncertainty. the chapter argues that \\ntoday™s innovations in measuring economic \\ninequality can open the way for the more sys\\n-tematic

national \\nstatistical authorities ideally would produce \\nrich annual household surveys of individuals™ \\nliving conditions. and the tax administration \\nwould publish income and wealth administra\\n-tive tax each year. to track income and wealth \\ninequality, survey data and tax data would be \\nlinked so that it would be possible to know \\nthe ˆscal income reported in the tax data by \\nan individual who participated in the living \\nconditions survey. but linked survey and tax \\ndata are an exception across the globe, done by \\nonly a few countries: for example, sweden and \\nother nordic countries. and even there, the \\nability to measure inequality has deteriorated \\nin recent decades, partly because of the large \\nwealth hidden in o˚shore ˆnancial assets with\\n-out a proper international registration system \\nto follow them.\\n7in many countries tax data are not available to \\nthe public. ˜e production of administrative tax \\ndata has historically been closely related to the \\nexistence of an income or wealth tax in a country. \\nit was the introduction of the income tax in the \\nunited states in 1913, and in india in 1922, that \\nled public administrations to publish income \\ntax statistics. such information is critical for tax \\nadministrations to properly administer taxes \\nand for legislators and taxpayers to be informed \\nabout tax policy. but governments are sometimes \\nunwilling to publicly release the data.\\n8while some countries have released new \\ntax data over the past decade, others have \\nactually stopped producing them. and when \\ngovernments repeal income or wealth taxes, the \\nstatistical tools to measure inequality also dis\\n-appear. ˜e deterioration of administrative tax \\ndata thus raises

widespread protocols to assess who \\nis being left behind or extreme wealth concentration might take years or even decades to generate, with con\\n-straints ranging from corruption to pressure by

because of disclosures such as those \\nin the panama papers and the paradise papers.1 on the other side of the distribution, decentralized reporting \\nbased on investigative journalistic research routinely \\nuncovers abuse towards disadvantaged groups: when \\nall other mechanisms that give voice to excluded groups fail, journalism is often their last hope.2amartya sen has argued that a free

globalized world, internationally coordinated \\nefforts to ˚nd and disclose information can catch up with actors that operate strategically in different coun\\n-tries, taking advantage of transparency blind spots. the global investigative journalism network and the \\ninternational consortium of investigative journalism are two prominent examples of this approach.6 these networks have the potential to develop and defend \\nstandards of responsible reporting and diversify the risks of pressure from interest groups.quality journalism tends to face ˚nancial, polit-ical and safety challenges. when journalism and me-dia produce information and knowledge that has the characteristics of a public good, indirect and direct subsidies remain fundamental to avoid underprovision.\\n7 journalists can be subject to pressures, intimidation and attacks, which appear to be on the rise in many countries,8 highlighting the importance of protecting an \\nindependent, plural and diverse

lives. surveys, like any other data source, \\nhave pros and cons in the measurement of ine\\n-quality (table˛3.1). one way of overcoming the \\nlimitations of each data source is to combine data \\nfrom di˚erent types of sources, particularly com\\n-bining administrative tax data with survey data.\\nfor example, consider the level and evolution \\nof inequality in brazil and india. in brazil house\\n-hold surveys show that the richest 10˛percent \\nreceived just over 40˛percent of total income in \\n2015, but when all forms of income are consid\\n-eredšnot just income reported in

1˛percent may \\nhave an income share close to 20˛percent. but \\nhouseholds report an income share of around \\n10˛percent, suggesting that household survey \\ndata starkly underestimate incomes at the top of \\nthe distribution. ˜e extent to which they do so \\nvaries by country but is likely to be substantial. \\nin addition, surveys may also miss important \\nevolutions. in brazil, household surveys indicate \\nthe income share of the top 10˛percent has fallen \\nover the past two decades.\\n19\\n but revised estimates \\nbased on additional sources of information from \\nnational accounts and tax data suggest that the \\nincome share has been fairly stable. household \\nsurveys captured fairly well the increase in wage \\nincome across most of the distribution, which \\nhas

\\ndividends, retained earnings and so on) among \\nthe wealthy.\\n26 second, rates of return on wealth \\nhave been much higher than macroeconomic \\nincome growth over the past four decades, \\nimplying that wealth is taking an increasingly \\nimportant place in 21st century economies.\\n27 how the fast growth of wealth is distributed \\nacross the population becomes a pressing \\nquestion. unfortunately, available o˘cial data \\nare even scarcer for wealth than for income, so \\ndistributional national accounts estimates for \\nwealth inequality cover only a few countries at \\nthis stage.\\nfor transparency, the distributional national \\naccounts project releases distributional nation\\n-al accounts estimates and the methods used \\nto compute them. technical details and the \\ncomputer codes used to produce the estimates \\n(including those presented in this chapter) \\nare published online on the world inequality \\ndatabase website.\\n28 ˜is level of transparency \\nshould become the norm for existing economic \\nstatistics databases.\\ninequality series published online should \\nalso be as comprehensive as possible, given the \\nlimitations of summary measures of inequality \\n(as discussed in the introduction to part ii of \\nthe report), which can mask relevant inequal\\n-ity dynamics behind a veil of stability. beyond \\no˚ering summary measures and a limited set of \\ndecile shares, the world inequality database \\nproject publishes average income and wealth \\nlevels for each 1˛percent of the population in \\na given country or region (that is, income and \\nwealth percentiles). given the importance \\nof the very top groups in income and wealth \\ngrowth, the project decomposes the top 1˛per\\n-cent itself into smaller subgroups (up to the \\n108    |    \\nhuman development report \\n2019\\ntop 0.001˛percent) and estimates income and \\nwealth levels for each.\\ncurrently, the united nations system of \\nnational accounts includes standards and \\nguidance only for aggregate indicators.\\n29 ˜e \\nnext revision, due sometime in 2022œ2024, \\nmight consider how to cover distribution of \\nincome and wealth growth across the popu\\n-lation, in line with the recommendations of \\nthe 2008 report of the commission on the \\nmeasurement of economic performance and \\nsocial progress.\\n30\\n such an evolution would \\nrepresent signiˆcant progress for global public \\nstatistics and global public debates on growth \\nand inequality. the distributional national \\naccounts framework considered in this chapter \\nprovides a concrete model of how this shi˝ \\nbeyond averages could work.\\nthe elephant curve of global \\ninequality and growth\\nthe release of new tax data and the recent \\nmethodological developments by research\\n-ers collaborating with the world inequality \\ndatabase and at the world inequality lab make \\nit possible to produce new inequality estimates \\n(see boxes˛3.2 and 3.3 for deˆnitions of income \\nand consumption concepts used throughout \\nthe report).\\n31 a starting place in tracking the \\nevolution of income inequality over time and \\nacross countries is to estimate the share of total \\nincome received by the richest 10˛percent of the \\npopulation. but such an indicator should be \\ncomplemented by othersšideally, the income \\nlevel or growth of each percentile, or 1˛percent \\nof the population, as below.\\nbox 3.2what income concepts are we measuring?this chapter focuses on the distribution of national income, which is the sum of all income received by \\nindividuals in an economy. this corresponds to gross \\ndomestic product, to which are added net income from abroad (when a brazilian citizen owns a company in \\nindia, the income from the capital of the company is counted in brazil) and from which are subtracted the \\namounts required to replace any productive apparatus (roads, machines, computers) that has become obsolete.there are two broad ways to measure income \\nreceived by individuals in a country: before taxes and government transfers (pretax income) and after taxes and government transfers (post-tax income). there are \\ndifferent ways to de˚ne pre- and post-tax incomes, and \\nde˚nitions can affect the results substantially. in the \\nworld inequality lab™s distributional national accounts \\nframework, pretax national income is de˚ned as the \\nsum of all personal income ˜ows, before taking into ac\\n-count the tax and transfer system but after taking into account pension and unemployment insurance systems. this concept adjusts traditional computations of ﬁmar-ket income,ﬂ as explained in spotlight 3.3. contributions \\nto pension and unemployment insurance schemes are considered deferred income and therefore deducted, but \\nthe corresponding bene˚ts are included.the adjustment is crucial for good comparability of pretax inequality across countries. otherwise a country with a public pension system would appear to have arti˚cially high pretax inequality (because retired indi\\n-viduals would have no pretax income and would appear as ﬁvirtual poorﬂ before taxes), while a country with private pensions would have positive pretax income for the elderly (because they would bene˚t from pretax in\\n-come from their pension plans). differences in inequal-ity measures between the countries would not re˜ect differences in income concentration or the effectiveness of pension systems but simply different choices made for organizing the pension system.in the end, pretax income is similar to the taxable income of many countries, but its de˚nition is usually broader and more comparable across countries. several variants of pretax income should be looked at, and the distributional national accounts guidelines discuss them in more detail. unless stated otherwise, the income concept in this chapter is pretax income.1post-tax national income equals pretax income after \\nsubtracting all taxes and adding all forms of government \\ntransfers. in line with the distributional national accounts \\nmethodology, all forms of government spending are allo\\n-cated to individuals, so that post-tax income sums to na-tional income. not doing so would make countries with \\na stronger provision of public goods appear mechanically \\npoorer. by de˚nition, at the aggregate or macroeconomic \\nlevelšwhen summing all income of all individuals in a \\ncountryšpost-tax national income is exactly equal to \\npretax national income and to national income.note\\n1.˛see alvaredo and others (2016) for a technical description of income concepts and methods used for this chapter.\\nchapter 3\\n measuring inequality in income and wealth\\n    |

55˛percent in india.\\n33income inequality based on the top 10˛per\\n-cent™s income share has risen since 1980 \\nin most regions but at different rates (fig\\n-ure˛3.2). ˜e rise was extreme in the russian \\nfederation, which was one of the most equal \\ncountries in 1990 (at least by this measure) \\nand became one of the most unequal in just \\nˆve years. ˜e rise was also pronounced in \\nindia and the united states, though not as \\nsharp as in the russian federation. in china, \\na˝er a sharp rise, inequality stabilized in the \\nmid-2000s. ˜e rise in inequality in europe \\nwas more moderate than in other regions. \\ninequality in sub-saharan africa, brazil \\nand the middle east stayed extremely high, \\nwith the 10˛percent™s income share around \\n55œ60˛percent. these extreme inequality \\nlevels in low- and middle-income countries \\nalso deserve particular attention.\\n34the diversity of patterns across countries \\nsince 1980 shows that the extreme rise in \\ninequality in some parts of the world was not \\ninevitable but resulted from policy choices. \\nopenness to trade and the digitalization of \\nthe economy are o˝en put forward to explain \\nthe rise in inequality in a country, but such \\narguments fail to fully account for the diversity \\nof trajectories just presented. ˜e radical diver\\n-gence of the united states and europešde\\n-spite

institutions.\\n35 fiscal redistri\\n-bution and monetary transfers to the worse-o˚ \\nindeed helped low-income groups in europe \\nbut did not play the main role in restraining the \\nincrease in

the world inequality lab and its network of partners, the \\nobjective is a fully integrated representation of the economy. it would link the microeconomic study of \\nincome and wealth inequality (typically focusing on household wages, transfers and poverty or inequality) with macroeconomic issues such as capital accumula\\n-tion, the aggregate structure of property and privatiza\\n-tion or nationalization policies. too often, ﬁmicroﬂ and \\nﬁmacroﬂ issues have been treated separately.\\nto be clear, however, a lot of progress is needed \\nbefore it will be possible to publish a fully integrated ap-proach to these issues, analysing the joint evolution of \\ninequality of income and wealth in all countries. indeed, that approach requires careful measurement not only of pretax and post-tax income inequality but also of the distribution of savings rates across different income groups.the production of such seriesšpretax inequality, \\npost-tax inequality and savings rate inequalityšwill \\nmake it possible to systematically relate income, wealth and eventually consumption (income minus savings). in our view, however, it would be a mistake to overempha\\n-size the consumption perspective, as the literature on poverty has sometimes done. consumption obviously is a very important indicator of wealth, particularly at the bottom of the distribution. the problem is that house-hold surveys routinely used to measure consumption tend to underestimate income, consumption and wealth at the top.in addition, consumption is not always well de˚ned for top income groups, which generally save a very large \\nshare of their income, choosing to consume more in lat-er years, but more generally to consume the prestige or \\neconomic or political power conferred by wealth owner\\n-ship. to develop a consistent and global perspective on \\neconomic inequalityšone that views economic actors not only as consumers and workers but also as owners and investorsšrequires

is the income inequality target about? it seeks to ensure that people in the bottom income groups see \\n\\ngrowth that is at least as high as the average. while the \\ntarget is meant to be achieved by 2030, it is useful to \\nlook at the past to consider how countries have fared on \\n\\nthe indicators relevant to the target. the united states, \\n\\ndespite high overall economic growth, the bottom \\n40˛percent of the population has seen pretax income per \\n\\nadult fall by 2˛percent, from $13,700 in 1980 to $13,400 \\n\\nin 2017.3 during the same period the average income in the united states grew 66˛percent, from $41,900 to \\n\\n$61,400. if the bottom 40˛percent™s income had grown \\n\\nas fast as the average, it would be $22,600 today.\\nensuring that the bottom 40˛percent sees growth \\nthat is at least as high as the average may not be enough \\n\\nto contain rising inequalities. take another example: at \\n\\nthe global level, average annual pretax income increased \\n\\n95˛percent (net of in˜ation) for the bottom 40˛percent, \\n\\nfrom •1,300 in 1980 to •2,500 in 2017, but increased \\n\\n40˛percent overall, from •11,100 to •16,600. thus, the \\n\\nglobal bottom 40˛percent saw growth that was 45˛per\\n-centage points higher than the global average.at the other end of the distribution, the top 0.1˛per\\n-cent™s average annual pretax income increased 117˛per\\n-cent, from •671,600 to •1,462,000. despite its small size, \\n\\nthe 0.1˛percent saw a larger share of total growth than \\n\\nthe bottom 40˛percent of the populationšabout 12˛per\\n-cent versus about 8.5˛percent. indeed, it is mathematical\\n-\\nly impossible for all groups to see growth that is higher \\n\\nthan the average. at the global level, those who lost \\n\\nwere the middle 40˛percent, whose average income rose \\n\\njust over 33˛percent, from •11,900 in 1980 to •15,600 in \\n\\n2016. so, their share in global income was reduced. this \\n\\nshows that ensuring that the

wealth taxesšas \\nafter world war ii in europe (france and \\ngermany). to understand what a zero or \\nnegative net public wealth situation implies, \\nconsider the following: a government with \\nnegative public wealth willing to repay its debts \\nwould have to sell all its ˆnancial assets (such as \\nstocks) and nonˆnancial assets (such as roads) \\nbut would still be indebted. taxpayers would \\nthus have to continue to pay taxes to reimburse \\nowners of the debt, and citizens would also \\nhave to pay a rent to the new owners of the \\nstock of capital that was formerly public (roads, \\nenergy or water systems, or health or education \\ninfrastructure). such a situation arguably leaves \\ngovernment with little room to invest in the \\nfuture (in, say, education or environmental \\nprotection) and thus tackle current and future \\nincome and wealth inequality.\\na combination of factors accounts for these \\ntrends. ˜e reduction in the share of public \\nwealth accounts for a part of the rise of private \\nwealth. the decline in net public wealth is \\nalso due largely to the rise of public debt. ˜e \\nratio of public assets to national income has \\nremained fairly stable because a significant \\nchunk of public assets was privatized (particu\\n-larly shares in public or semipublic companies) \\nand the market value of the remaining assets \\nincreased. but the long-run decline in the share \\nof public wealth in total wealth, in no way in\\n-evitable, is the result of public policy choices \\n(privatizing public assets, expanding

global distribution.\\n˜is rise was more than o˚set at the top by \\nthe rise in within-country wealth inequality \\neverywhere, so wealth increased much faster \\nat the top of the global distribution: while \\nthe average wealth growth was 2.8˛percent a \\nyear per adult over 1987œ2017, it was 3.5˛per\\n-cent for the top 1˛percent, 4.5˛percent for the \\ntop 0.1˛percent and 5.7˛percent for the top \\n0.01˛percent.\\n˜e factors a˚ecting wealth inequality (in\\n-come inequality, inequality of savings rates \\nand asset rates of return) are a˚ected by public \\npolicies. for example, progressive taxation in\\n-˙uences income and savings inequality, while \\nˆnancial regulation and innovation can have \\nan impact on asset rates of return. privatization \\ncan also play a role when it beneˆts mostly a \\nspeciˆc part of the distribution, as in many \\ncountries since the 1980s and particularly in \\nemerging countries. so there is nothing inevi\\n-table about the rise of wealth inequality within \\ncountries.\\nin the russian federation and china the con\\n-centration of wealth increased since the 1990s. \\n˜e share of the top 1˛percent doubled (from \\n22˛percent in 1995 to 43˛percent in 2015 in \\nthe russian federation and from 15˛percent to \\n30˛percent in china, although with some vol\\n-atility; ˆgure˛3.18). ˜e divergences between \\nthe two countries come from the di˚erences \\nbetween their privatization strategies: ˜e fast \\npace of privatizing public assets in the russian \\nfederation favoured the wealthiest even more \\nthan in china. in the russia federation hous\\n-ing had a small dampening e˚ect on the rise of \\ninequality. in china housing wealth was privat\\n-ized through a very unequal process, whereas \\nthe approach was more gradual and equitable \\nin the russia federation.\\n˜e united states has had a less abrupt but \\nno less signiˆcant rise of wealth inequality since \\nthe mid-1980s, a˝er a considerable decline in \\nthe 1930s and 1940s, then due particularly to \\nthe policies of the new deal (see ˆgure˛3.18). \\n˜e share of wealth owned by the top 1˛percent \\ngrew from a historic low of 22˛percent in 1978 \\nto almost 39˛percent in the 2010s. ˜e key \\ndriver of this increase was the upsurge of very \\ntop incomes, enabled by ˆnancial deregulation \\nand lower top tax rates. inequality of savings \\nrates and of asset return rates ampliˆed the phe\\n-nomenon in a snowballing trend. meanwhile, \\nchapter 3\\n measuring inequality in income and wealth\\n    |    131\\nwealth inequality has been increasing since 1980, unaffected by the 2008 crisisthe income of the middle and the bottom of \\nthe distribution stagnated, and household \\ndebt (mortgages, student loans and credit card

france and the united kingdom wealth \\ninequality also increased after a historical \\ndecline, but at a much slower pace than in the \\nunited states. ˜e top 1˛percent share rose \\nfrom 16˛percent in both countries in 1985 to \\n20˛percent in the united kingdom in 2012 and \\n23˛percent in france in 2015. ˜is was due to \\ngreater earnings disparities, ampliˆed by a fall \\nin tax

disproportion\\n-ately owned by the wealthy, increased.\\nsmall changes in savings rate di˚erentials \\nacross wealth groups, or in progressive taxation \\npatterns, can have a very large impact on wealth \\ninequality, though it may take several decades \\nfor the impacts to play out. ˜is raises many \\nissues for the future of wealth inequality: if the \\ncurrent trends in savings, income and

\\nwithin a nation, within a group or even within \\nhouseholds. it is particularly important to have \\na better grasp of who and where those furthest \\nbehind and at the very bottom of the income \\ndistribution are. one way of looking within \\ncountries is to identify the hotspots, the subna\\n-tional districts, states or provinces set not to have \\na gdp per capita of $4,000 or more in 2005 \\npurchasing power parity terms in 2030.\\n1 ˜ere \\nare 840 such poverty hotspots globally, among \\nmore than 3,600 districts, states and provinces. \\nmoreover, 102 countries have at least one region \\nthat qualiˆes. in other words, people are being \\nle˝ behind in a large, diverse group of countries.\\nbut there is considerable variation within \\ncountries. over half of low-income countries \\nhave at least one region that is not a pover\\n-ty hotspot; 36 of 46 lower-middle-income \\ncountries have at least one region that is. even \\namong upper middle-income countries some \\n30˛percent of regions are hotspots.\\n2another way of identifying diversity within \\ncountries is to consider the human development \\nindex (hdi) at a subnational level.\\n3 by this \\nmeasure, there are ﬁclustersﬂ of hotspots that \\ncross national borders (see ˆgure˛s3.1.1 for an \\nexample with a group of countries in the gulf \\nof guinea). clusters of low subnational hdi \\nvalues exist in latin america, including parts \\nof central america. in centralœsouth asia \\nsubnational areas stretch from tajikistan and \\nkyrgyzstan to most of afghanistan, and in \\nsoutheast asia, sections of cambodia and viet \\nnam. not all in a hotspot are necessarily poor, \\nof course. within any area the next step implies \\nidentifying households most in need of social \\nassistance. most countries apply some sort of test \\nto decide who is eligible for assistance, tests that \\ngenerally are ˙awed. a critical challenge for the \\ntests is their high exclusion errors (not including \\nindividuals or households who are eligible but \\ndo not receive a beneˆt) and their high inclusion \\nerrors (of individuals or households who are not \\neligible but do receive a beneˆt). ˜e inclusion \\nand exclusion errors for a set of african econ\\n-omies are striking (table˛s3.1.1). for instance, \\nghana has an estimated inclusion error of \\n35˛percent (35˛percent of the identiˆed poor \\nhouseholds are nonpoor) and an exclusion error \\nof 63˛percent (63˛percent of the poor are not \\nidentiˆed as poor using the proxy means test).\\nfinally, it is important to go even deeper to look \\nwithin households. as noted, many countries \\ntry to identify poor and vulnerable households. \\n˜ere are good reasons for using households as a \\ngeneral proxy. one reason is that data on income \\nand consumption are o˝en better collectedšand \\nunderstoodšat the household level. a second is \\nthat the average well-being of a household is cor\\n-related with individual well-being among those \\nwithin it. and so while household identiˆcation \\ninevitably comes with inclusion and exclusion \\nerrors, it has been the standard for decades.\\n˜e outliers to this pattern are signiˆcant \\nand o˝en comprise people with disabilities, or\\n-phans and widows, migrants and mobile popu\\n-lations, and the homeless. ˜e numbers of such \\ncases are considerable. in 30 sub-saharan

an inequality index\\njames foster, professor of economics and international a˚airs at the george washington university, \\nand nora lustig, samuel z. stone professor of latin american economics and director of the \\ncommitment to equity institute at tulane university\\na useful way to describe the distribution of \\nincome is the lorenz curve, constructed as \\nfollows.\\n1 first, the population is ranked ac\\n-cording to income (or consumption, wealth or \\nanother measure of resources) from the lowest \\nto the highest. ˜en the cumulative shares \\nof individuals in the population are plotted \\nagainst their respective cumulative share \\nin total income. ˜e curve drawn is called \\nthe lorenz curve. ˜e horizontal axis of the \\nlorenz curve shows the cumulative percent\\n-ages of the population arranged in increasing \\norder of income. ˜e vertical axis shows the \\npercentage of total income received by a \\nfraction of the population. for example, the \\n(80˛percent, 60˛percent) point on the lorenz \\ncurve means that the poorest 80˛percent of \\nthe population receives 60˛percent of total \\nincome while the richest 20˛percent receives \\n40˛percent of total income.\\n2figure s3.2.1 shows two lorenz curves: l\\n1 and l\\n2. if everybody has the same income, the \\nlorenz curve will coincide with the 45-de\\n-gree line. ˜e greater the level of inequality, \\nthe farther the lorenz curve will be from the \\n45-degree line. in the ˆgure, l\\n2 lies below and \\nto the right of l\\n1, so an inequality index would \\nbe expected to indicate greater inequality in \\nthe l\\n2 case. another way to see this is that the \\npoorest \\nx˛percent of the population will always \\nhave an equal or greater share of income under \\nl1 than under l\\n2, regardless of what \\nx is. ˜is \\nis called the lorenz dominance criterion or \\nlorenz criterion for short.\\nwhat constitutes a ﬁgoodﬂ inequality index? \\none approach is to require the measure to be \\nconsistent with the lorenz criterion: that is, \\nto be lorenz consistent. for a measure to be \\nlorenz consistent the following two conditions \\nmust hold: first, inequality rises (declines) \\nwhen the lorenz curve lies everywhere below \\n(above) the original lorenz curve as with l\\n2 compared with l\\n1 (l1 compared to l\\n2) in the \\nˆgure. second, inequality is the same when \\nlorenz curves are identical. for a measure to \\nbe weakly lorenz consistent, condition 1 \\nbecomes the following: 1™. inequality rises (de\\n-clines) or stays the same when the lorenz curve \\nlies everywhere below (above) the original \\nlorenz curve.\\na second approach is to require the inequal\\n-ity index to fulˆl the following four principles:\\n1 symmetry (or anonymity). if two people \\nswitch incomes, the index level should not \\nchange.\\n2 population invariance (or replication in\\n-variance). if the population is replicated or \\nﬁclonedﬂ one or more times, the index level \\nshould not change.\\n3 scale invariance (or mean independence). if \\nall incomes are scaled up or down by a com\\n-mon factor (for example, doubled), the index \\nlevel should not change.\\n4 transfer (or the pigou-dalton transfer \\nprinciple). if income is transferred from one \\nperson to another who is richer, the index \\nlevel should increase. in other words, in the \\nface of a regressive transfer, the index level \\nmust rise.\\nfigure s3.1.1lorenz curvecumulative incomecumulative populationl1l2source: \\nauthors™ creation.136    |    \\nhuman development report \\n2019\\nit can be shown that indices satisfying these \\nfour principles are lorenz consistent and vice \\nversa.\\n˜ese indices include:\\nł summary indices\\n based on relatively com\\n-plex formulas designed to capture inequal\\n-ity along the entire distribution. ˜e most \\ncommonly used are (in alphabetical order): \\nthe atkinson, gini and ˜eil measures (and \\nthe generalized entropy measures, more \\ngenerally).\\nwhile inequality measures that satisfy the \\ntransfer principle are in common use, there are \\nalso simpler indices that do not satisfy 1œ4 but \\nare popular. ˜ese include:\\nł partial indices \\nbased on simple formulas that \\nfocus on inequality across certain parts of \\nthe distribution. ˜ese include the kuznets \\nratios expressed as the income share of top \\nx˛percent over the income share of bottom \\ny˛percent. ˜ere are, of course, many possible \\nkuznets ratios. the one proposed by the \\nnobel laureate simon kuznets was 20/40.\\n3 partial indices also include the top income \\nshares, expressed as the income share of the \\ntop \\nx˛percent. common examples include \\nthe income share of the top 1˛percent or of \\nthe top 10˛percent.\\n4 ˜e top income shares \\nare, in fact, limiting cases of kuznets ratios \\nobtained by setting the ﬁbottomﬂ income \\nshare to cover the entire population: that is, \\nby setting \\ny˛percent˛=˛100˛percent.\\n5such partial indices satisfy the following \\nprinciple:\\n4\\' weak transfer principle: if income is trans\\n-ferred from one person to another who is \\nricher (or equally rich), the index level should \\nincrease or remain unchanged.\\nin other words, in the face of a regressive \\ntransfer, the inequality index can never decline, \\nbut it may remain unchanged. it can be shown \\nthat indices satisfying 1œ3 and 4\\' principles are \\nweakly lorenz consistent\\n and vice versa.\\nin sum, the summary indices of atkinson, \\ngini and theil (and the whole family of \\ngeneralized entropy indices) satisfy princi\\n-ples 1œ3 and 4 and thus are lorenz consistent \\n(and vice versa). ˜is guarantees that in the \\nface of a regressive (progressive) transfer \\nanywhere along the distribution, inequality \\nmeasured by any of these indices will rise \\n(decline). in contrast, the kuznets ratios and \\ntop income shares focus on limited ranges of \\nincomes and thus violate the transfer prin\\n-ciple (and thus violate lorenz consistency). \\n˜e latter means that transfers entirely within \\nor entirely outside the relevant ranges have no \\ne˚ect on measured inequality. for example, \\nthe 10/40 ratio is insensitive to regressive \\ntransfers that stay within the poorest 40˛per\\n-cent, within the richest 10˛percent or within \\nthe remaining 50˛percent in the middle, while \\nthe income share of the top 1˛percent is in\\n-sensitive to transfers within the top 1˛percent \\nand within the bottom 99˛percent. despite \\ndisagreeing with the transfer principle, and \\nthus the lorenz criterion, these partial indi\\n-ces are useful for conveying easily understood \\ninformation about the extent of inequality. \\nimportantly, they satisfy the weak transfer \\nprinciple and thus guarantee that in the face \\nof a regressive transfer anywhere along the \\ndistribution, inequality measured by any of \\nthese indices will never decline but, notably, \\nit can stay the same.\\nin contrast, other common inequality indices \\ndo not even fulˆl the weak transfer principle \\n(transfer principle 4\\'). examples include the \\nquantile ratios (such as the income of percen\\n-tile 90 to the income of the 10th percentile also \\nknown as the p90/p10 ratio) and the variance \\nof logarithms. for example, a transfer from the \\n5th percentile to the 10th would reduce the \\np90/p10 ratio despite the fact that the trans\\n-fer is clearly regressive because it redistributes \\nincome from the very poor to the less poor. \\nregressive transfers at the upper end of the dis\\n-tribution can lower the variance of logarithms \\nand lead to extreme con˙icts with the lorenz \\ncriterion.\\n6finally, the mean to median ratio (mean di\\n-vided by the median) is a measure of skewness \\nthat can also be interpreted as a partial index of \\ninequality. virtually every inequality measure is \\na ratio of two ﬁincome standardsﬂ that summa\\n-rize the size of the income distributions from \\ntwo perspectives: one that emphasizes higher \\nincomes and a second that emphasizes lower \\nincomes.\\n7 so long as only distributions that are \\nskewed to the right are considered, the mean \\nexceeds the median, and the mean to median \\nratio takes on this form. ˜is index satisˆes the \\nˆrst three principles but can violate the weak \\ntransfer principle when the regressive transfer \\nchapter 3\\n measuring inequality in income and wealth\\n    |    137\\nraises the median income. like the other partial \\nindices, it is weaker in terms of the properties it \\nsatisˆes but has the advantage of simplicity and \\nis o˝en used in political economy.\\n8how to apply the above in practice? when \\nmaking pairwise comparisons, ˆrst graph the \\nlorenz curves. if the lorenz curves do not \\ncross, an unambiguous lorenz comparison can \\nbe made. one can conclude from this that any \\nreasonable (that is, lorenz consistent) measure \\nwould agree that inequality has unambiguously \\nincreased or declined, according to what the \\nlorenz curves indicates. however, it is also pos\\n-sible that the lorenz curves cross, in which case \\nreasonable inequality measures can disagree. \\nwhat can be done when lorenz curves cross? \\none approach is to narrow the set of reasonable \\ninequality measures using an additional crite\\n-rion. for instance, transfer-sensitive measures \\nare lorenz consistent measures that emphasize \\ndistributional changes at the lower end over \\nthose at the upper end. ˜e atkinson class and \\nthe two ˜eil measures (including the mean log \\ndeviation) are transfer-sensitive measures. by \\ncontrast, the coe˘cient of variation (standard \\ndeviation divided by the mean) is neutral with \\nrespect to where transfers occur, while many \\nother generalized entropy measures emphasize \\ndistributional changes at the upper end and \\nthus are not in the set of transfer-sensitive \\nmeasures.\\nwhen do all transfer-sensitive measures \\nagree? as a subset of lorenz-consistent meas\\n-ures, they agree when lorenz curves do not \\ncross as well as in many cases when they do \\ncross. for example, suppose that lorenz curves \\ncross once and that the ˆrst lorenz curve is \\nhigher at lower incomes than the second. ˜ere \\nis a simple test: ˜e ˆrst has less inequality than \\nthe second, according to all transfer-sensitive \\nmeasures exactly when the coe˘cient of varia\\n-tion for the ˆrst is no higher than that for the \\nsecond.\\n9 an even simpler approach is to select \\na (ˆnite) set of particularly relevant inequality \\nmeasures for making inequality comparisons. \\nif all agree on a given comparison, the result is \\nrobust. if not, the conclusion is ambiguous for \\nthat set of measures, with inequality ranked one \\nway for some measures and reversed for others.\\ntable s3.2.1 shows the statistics most fre\\n-quently published in commonly used interna\\n-tional databases.\\n9thus, the most frequently reported ine\\n-quality measures include two that are lorenz \\nconsistent (the gini and theil measures), \\none that is weakly lorenz consistent (the top \\n10˛percent) and one that is neither (the 90/10 \\nquantile ratio). in addition to inequality meas\\n-ures, international datasets report other sta\\n-tistics. among those, the most frequent is the \\ndistribution of income by decile.\\n10notes\\n1 named after max otto lorenz, a us economist who developed \\nthe idea of the lorenz curve in 1905.2 often, especially with historical data, we only have \\ngrouped-data or information on equal-sized population groups \\nsuch as quintiles or deciles (5 or 10 groups, respectively). \\nthe resulting lorenz curve is an approximation of the actual \\nlorenz curve where inequality within each group has been \\nsuppressed.3 some international databases report the 20/20 (sometimes \\ncalled s80/s20) and 10/40 ratios.4 the top 1˛percent has been the focus of the recent literature \\non top incomes. see, for example, atkinson, piketty and saez \\n(2011).5 by definition, 100˛percent of the population receives 100˛per-cent of the income so the denominator of the kuznets ratio \\nbecomes 100/100˛=˛1, and thus the 1/100 kuznets ratio equals \\n1˛percent.6 foster and ok 1999.7 foster and others (2013, p. 15). for example, one atkinson \\nmeasure compares the higher arithmetic mean to the lower \\ngeometric means; the 1˛percent income share effectively \\ncompares the higher 1˛percent mean to the lower arithmetic \\nmean.8 the mean to median ratio is the inequality measure used by \\nmeltzer and richards (1981) in their model to predict the size \\nof government. the greater the ratio, the higher the taxes and \\nredistribution.9 for details, see shorrocks and foster (1987). see also zheng \\n(2018), who presents additional criteria for making compari-sons when lorenz curves

\\nconcept. while this approach is broadly the \\nsame across all ˆve databases mentioned, the \\ndeˆnition of the speciˆc income concepts, the \\nincome concepts included in the analysis and \\nthe methods to allocate taxes and public spend\\n-ing di˚er. ˜is spotlight focuses on comparing \\nthe deˆnition of income conceptsšthat is, on \\nthe types of incomes, taxes and public spending \\nincluded in the construction of the preˆscal and \\npostˆscal income concepts. ˜ere are important \\ndi˚erences, and some can have signiˆcant impli\\n-cations for the scale of redistribution observed.\\n˜e following table compares the deˆnitions \\nof income used by the six databases mentioned \\nabove.\\n˜ere are ˆve important di˚erences:\\nł while all six databases start out with similar \\ndeˆnitions of factor income, the additional \\ncomponents included in prefiscal income \\ndi˚ers. ˜is is important because the pre\\n-ˆscal income is what each database uses to \\nrank individuals prior to adding transfers \\nand subtracting taxes and will thus a˚ect \\nthe ensuing redistribution results (see point \\non the treatment of pensions below). for \\nexample, euromod does not include the \\nvalue of consumption of own production \\nas part of preˆscal income, while the rest of \\nthe databases do. euromod, the income \\ndistribution and lis do not include the \\n(imputed) value of owner-occupied housing, \\nwhile the other three do. ˜ere is also a fun\\n-damental di˚erence in the treatment of con\\n-tributory pensions (see the next paragraph). \\nfinally, the world inequality database also \\nincludes undistributed proˆts in its deˆni\\n-tion of preˆscal income.\\nł second, egdna, euromod, the income \\ndistribution database and the lis treat \\nold-age pensions from social security as \\npure transfers, while the world inequality \\ndatabase treats them (together with un\\n-employment benefits) as pure deferred \\nincome. ˜e ceq data

a˚ect all forms of gender \\ninequality, from violence against women to \\nthe glass ceiling in business and politics. in \\naddition, gender-speciˆc tradeo˚s burden the \\ncomplex choices women encounter in work, \\nfamily and social lifešresulting in cumulative \\nstructural barriers to equality. ˜e tradeo˚s \\nare in˙uenced strongly by social norms and \\nby a structure of mutually reinforcing gender \\ngaps. ˜ese norms and gaps are not directly \\nobservable, so they are o˝en overlooked and \\nnot systematically studied.\\ngender inequality in \\nthe 21st century\\ngender inequality is intrinsically linked to hu\\n-man development, and it exhibits the same dy\\n-namics of convergence in basic capabilities and \\ndivergence in enhanced capabilities. overall, \\nit is still the casešas martha nussbaum has \\npointed outšthat ﬁwomen in much of the \\nworld lack support for fundamental functions \\nof a human life.ﬂ\\n9 ˜is is evident in the gender \\ninequality

happens in education and the \\nlabour market.\\neconomic participation also shows a gra\\n-dient (see figure˛4.4, right panel). when \\nempowerment is basic and precarious, women \\nare over-represented, as for contributing fam\\n-ily workers (typically not receiving monetary \\npayment). ˜en, as economic power increases \\nfrom employee to employer, and from employ\\n-er to top

analyses,2 practical \\ngender needs refer to the needs of women and men \\nto make everyday life easier, such as access to water, \\nbetter transportation, child care facilities and so on. \\naddressing these will not directly challenge gender \\npower relations but may remove important obstacles \\nto women™s economic empowerment. strategic gender \\nneeds refer to needs for society to shift in gender roles \\nand relations, such as a law condemning gender-based \\nviolence, equal access to credit, equal inheritance and \\nothers. addressing these should alter gender power \\nrelations. sometimes practical and strategic needs \\ncoincidešfor example, the practical need for child \\ncare coincides with the strategic need to get a job out-side the home.3 the difference is comparable to that \\nbetween basic and enhanced capabilities discussed \\nin this report. transformative changes that can bring \\nabout normative and structural shifts are the strongest

of aggregation are \\nthen used in reporting results on the index.the ˚rst consists of a simple count (equivalent to the union approach), where the indicators are simply summed and therefore have the same weight. this result has a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 7:the calculation is a simple addition of dichotomic variables, but it com-plicates the disaggregation and analysis by dimension and indicator.\\nto address this, the second method follows the alkireœfoster methodol\\n-ogy,\\n1 which counts the different gender social norm biases that an individual faces at the same time (following the intersection approach). these dimen\\n-sions are analysed to determine who has a bias on each indicator. this result \\ncounts only people with high-intensity bias.the methods are applied to two

way individuals express \\n\\nand experience power in their lives, relationships and \\n\\ncommunities. reaching equality, women and men will \\n\\nhave the same agency to make choices and participate \\n\\nin society. while women and girls bear the brunt of \\n\\ngender inequalities, men and boys are also affected by \\ntraditional conceptions of gender.\\ngender is a social construct of attributes or roles \\nassociated with being male or female. what it means \\nto be a man or a woman is learned and internalized \\nbased on experiences and messages over the course of \\na lifetime, normalized through social structures, culture \\nand interactions. though men usually have more agency \\nthan the women in their lives, men™s decisions and be\\n-\\nhaviours are also profoundly shaped by rigid social and \\ncultural expectations related to masculinity.\\nmasculinity is the pattern of social behaviours or \\npractices associated with ideals about how men should \\n\\nbehave.1 some characteristics of masculinity relate to \\ndominance, toughness and risk-taking, recently referred \\n\\nto as toxic masculinity or the man box, in that traditional \\nbehaviours of the gender roles restrict men to act in a cer-tain way that preserves existing power structures. in 2019 \\n\\npromundo along with unilever estimated the economic \\n\\nimpacts of the man box in mexico, the united kingdom \\n\\nand the united states, considering bullying, violence, de-\\npression, suicide, binge drinking and traf˚c accidents as \\n\\ncosts of restricting men to masculine behaviours.2 two of \\nthe most damaging consequences for men are related to \\n\\ntheir mental health: men are less likely to seek mental \\n\\nhealth services than women are, and men are more likely \\n\\nto die by suicide than women are. besides the ethical and \\n\\nsocial gains of gender equality, men as individuals can \\n\\nbene˚t from expressing freely, from having more options \\n\\nin their own experiences and behaviours and from having \\n\\nbetter and healthier relationships with women and girls.so challenging rigid gender norms and power dy-namics in households and communities and involving \\nmen and boys in making these changes are important. \\nengaging men in preventing gender-based violence, \\n\\nsupporting women´s economic empowerment, pursuing \\nchange for reproductive health and acting as fathers or \\n\\ncaregivers are examples of how men can challenge their \\nnotions of masculinity and of their own selves.notes\\n1.˛ricardo and menengage 2014. 2.˛heilman and

journey. it identi˚es the evolution of different inequalities in human development and \\nexamines the dynamic ways in which they limit human freedoms. it goes beyond averages to discover trends in the com-plete distribution of income and wealth. it also looks at gender inequality and delves into the factors holding back half of humanity. we are now almost at the end of the journey: what is to be done?\\nno single policy will su˘ce, nor will the same \\npolicies be appropriate for all countries. ˜ere \\nare large and significant differences across \\ncountries in history, institutions, incomes and \\nadministrative capabilities. culture and social \\nnorms also matter, as the discussion on gender \\ninequality highlights (chapter˛4). moreover, \\ninequalities in human development are linked. \\nit is unlikely that households deprived of en\\n-hanced capabilities, let alone basic capabilities, \\nwill be at the top of the income scale. it is also \\nunlikely that women who su˚er discrimina\\n-tion in access to education and jobs will be \\namong the very rich. as parts i and ii of the \\nreport highlight, inequalities along the vari\\n-ous dimensions interact and generate feedback \\nloops. ˜is makes ˆghting inequality a daunt\\n-ing task. how can countries tackle the myriad \\npolicies and institutions that stand behind all \\nthe dimensions of inequality? where should \\nthey begin? should they focus on capabilities, \\non income or on gender? what policies are \\nmore e˚ective when and where?\\npart˛iii of the report, dealing with poli\\n-cies, addresses these questions. it proposes a \\nframework to support countries in tailoring \\na response to inequalities in human develop\\n-ment to their speciˆc circumstances, taking \\ninto account their political constraints and \\nadministrative capabilities. ˜e aim is to help \\nthem cra˝ their own responsesšrather than \\no˚er a single recipe applicable to all.\\nin beginning to think about what can be \\ndone, it is essential to consider time and place. \\naddressing inequalities in human develop\\n-ment in the 21st century is not the same as it \\nwas before. policymakers interested in ˆghting \\ninequalities will take into account today™s com\\n-plexities and challenges. certainly, much is to \\nbe learned from what policies have worked and \\nwhat policies have failed in the past, but those \\nlessons have to be relevant to here and now.\\nin this context, chapters 5 and 6 discuss two \\nkey trends that could blunt the ˆght against \\ninequalities in all countries. understanding \\nthese trends is essential because le˝ on their \\nown, they will tend to increase inequalities in \\nhuman development.\\nthe first trend relates to climate change \\n(chapter˛5). much has been written about this \\ntopicšthe focus here is on its interactions \\nwith inequality. in a nutshell, increased vola\\n-tility in the world™s climate and rising average \\ntemperatures are likely to translate into more \\n˙oods, droughts, hurricanes and related phe\\n-nomena. ˜e chapter also documents that the \\nimpacts will not be distributed evenly within \\nor across countries. some countries will su˚er \\nmore than others, and within countries some \\nregions more than others. in parallel some \\nhouseholds will su˚er more.\\nall this will tend to increase inequalitiesšand \\nmay even reduce the e˚ectiveness of policies. for \\ninstance, countries might make progress against \\nincome inequality through more progressive \\ntaxation, but that progress could be undone by \\nhouseholds™ greater exposure to climate risks. \\nclimate change may thus require strengthening \\nold tools and introducing new onesšfrom \\ndrought-resistant crops to new insurance ap\\n-proaches. ˜e chapter also considers interactions \\nin the other directionšhow inequalities can \\ncomplicate responses to climate change. indeed, \\nit is far harder to rally around common respons\\n-es in societies that are more polarized.\\nchapter˛6 focuses on technological change. \\nit has always been with us, but since the \\nindustrial revolution it has a˚ected the distri\\n-bution of income and capabilities in far more \\nprofound and long-lasting ways, in part because \\neconomic prosperityšand increasingly the na\\n-ture of sustainabilityšis tied to the

already unspooling in the form of melting ice sheets and, as is likely, record \\nheatwaves and superstorms. without bold collective action, these will only worsen over time, joined by a suite of other ca-lamities, from depressed crop yields to rising sea levels to potential con˜ict. as recognized in the sustainable development goals and the paris climate agreement, climate change is a global challenge.but it will not a˚ect everyone equally š not \\nin the same way, not at the same time, not at \\nthe same magnitude. poorer countries and \\npoorer people will be hit earliest and hardest. \\nsome countries could quite literally disappear. \\nof all climate change™s disequalizing e˚ects, \\nperhaps none is greater than that on future \\ngenerations, which will shoulder the burden \\nof previous generations™ fossil fuel-dependent \\ndevelopment pathways.\\ninequality runs the gamut of climate change, \\nfrom emissions and impacts to resilience and \\npolicy. climate change is a recipe for more \\ninequality in a world that already has plenty. \\nbut climate change and inequality, and the \\ninteraction of the two, are choices, not inevita\\n-bilities. even though the window for decisive \\nand bold action on climate is shrinking, there \\nis still time to make di˚erent choices.\\n˜is chapter suggests that by redressing ine\\n-qualities, action on climate could also be made \\neasier and faster. to see why, consider two of \\nthe multiple possible channels at play.\\n1 ˜e \\nˆrst relates to how individual consumption \\ndecisions add up to total emissions (box˛5.1).\\n2 ˜e second, which is the focus of this chapter \\nand likely more consequential, relates to how \\ninequality interacts with technological change \\nbox 5.1household income, inequality and greenhouse gas emissionshigher household incomes are associated with higher \\nemissions, but the impact of inequality on aggregate \\nemissions depends on how quickly emissions increase \\nas income rises.\\n1 there is a wide range of empirical es-timates for this relationship, showing that, on balance, \\nemissions increase more slowly than income in most \\ndeveloped and middle-income countries but at the same \\nrate (or even a little faster) in lower income countries.2taking this channel alone into account would imply \\nthat income inequality should be associated with low-er emissions in developed countries. to see how, con\\n-sider the impact of transferring income from the rich \\nto the poor in a developed country. even though rich \\npeople emit more, given that the rate at which emis\\n-sions increase is slower than the rate at which income does,3 the increase in emissions by poor people would be higher than the corresponding decrease in con\\n-sumption by rich people, leading to a net increase in emissions. and one would expect to see the opposite in developing countries, with reductions in inequality lowering emissions.4 however, the scale of the impact \\nof inequality through this channel tends to be small, certainly when compared with other determinants of \\nchanges in emissions, such as technological change and policies.5perhaps more important, the interplay of these \\nconsumption patterns within and across countriesšal\\n-though trending towards lower emissions overallšap-pears unlikely to substantially reduce global aggregate emissions.6notes\\n1.˛it also depends on how inequality interacts with rising income. for a comprehensive description of the different possibilities, see ravallion, heil and jalan (2000). \\n2.˛see, for instance, liddle (2015). for a detailed estimate for the philippines, see seriño and klasen (2015). 3.˛when this relationship is measured in terms of how much a \\npercentage change in income is re˜ected in a corresponding percentage change in emissionsšin technical terms, an elasticityšthis implies an elasticity of less than 1. \\n4.˛more precisely, this would happen if the elasticity were greater than 1. for some empirical support of the hypothesis of this differential impact of inequality in emissions \\nin developed and developing countries, see grunewald and others (2017). 5.˛to illustrate, sager (2017) calculated consumption-based carbon emissions engel curves \\n(showing the relationship between household income and average carbon dioxide emissions) for the united states for several years between 1996 and 2009. in a scenario where income is redistributed to perfect equality (a dramatic and extreme case), average carbon dioxide emissions in 2009 would have increased 2.3˛percent, from the \\nactual 33.9 tonnes per household to 34.7 tonnes. in contrast, had there been no technological change and assuming the same consumption composition between 1996 and \\n2009, average emissions would have increased 70˛percent, to 57.9 tonnes. 6.˛caron and fally 2018.higher inequality tends to make collective actionškey both within and across countries to curb climate changešmore dif˜cultand policy formation. ˜ere is some evidence \\nthat high inequality hinders the di˚usion of \\n\\nnew environmentally friendly technology.\\n3 inequality can influence the relative power \\n\\nof interests arguing for and against curbing \\n\\nemissions. emissions would be expected to \\n\\nbe higher when income is concentrated at the \\n\\ntop and when the resulting concentration of \\n\\neconomic power coincides with the interests \\n\\nof groups that oppose action on climate.\\n4 more generally, higher inequality tends to \\n\\nmake collective actionškey both within and \\n\\nacross countries to curb climate changešmore \\n\\ndi˘cult.\\n5 information is critical for collective \\naction, but the ability of different interest \\n\\ngroups to communicate tends to be lower when \\n\\ninequality is high,\\n6 with the concentration of \\nincome potentially leading to the suppression \\n\\nor propagation of information in order to \\n\\nserve a particular interest.\\n7 other interacting \\nmechanisms relate to how inequality shapes \\n\\nperceptions of fairness (with implications for \\n\\ncompliance and enforcement).\\n8where emissions are being decoupled from \\neconomic growthša hopeful sign that is \\n\\ndirectionally right but not yet at scale, despite \\n\\naccelerating over the past two decadesšthis is \\n\\nrelated to countries having

\\nbox 5.2from holocene to anthropocene: poweršand who wields itšat the brink of a new erathe environment has a profound impact on people™s capabilities and on their \\nability to convert capabilities into achievementsšand thus on human de-velopment.1 conversely, human activity affects the natural world, shaping \\nenvironmental processes and patterns at a global scale. arguably, human\\n-kind today is not just witnessing but also causing the sixth mass species extinction in the earth™s history.\\n2 while the stratigraphy community has yet to formally declare a new epoch (meaning that humanity is still in the holocene), the unfolding changes to the environment are so dramatic, and so heavily in˜uenced by humans, that the expression anthropocene has en-tered current use.3the anthropocene portends a worrying mix of power, fragility and uncer\\n-tainty. the end of the last glacial period and the beginning of the holocene \\nmore than 10,000 years ago ushered in a stable climate regimeša climatic cradle for humansšwith conditions favourable for permanent agriculture \\nand the dawn of civilizations. rising populations, wealth and technological know-how have translated into greater, seemingly unbridled power, includ\\n-ing over the environment. yet fragilities have always been evident. crops \\nare susceptible to pests and bad weather. infectious diseases have sprung \\nfrom (and through) domesticated animals and elsewhere.4 the interplay among humans, geography and the environment has been central to the \\nway civilizations have come and gone.5fast forward to today, and the intertwining of power, fragility and un\\n-certainty has not changed. the differences are in the scale and the stakes. humans have far more power to affect the environment, including at the planetary level, but no greater control. the list of negative feedback from human activities ranges from introducing invasive species to the plastics ep\\n-idemics in the oceans to ˚sheries stress and collapse to fossil fuel emissions and climate change.6 these and other activities have not just destabilized ecosystems but have also transformed planetary biogeochemical process\\n-es.7 humanity is thought to have already breached at least four of nine plan-etary boundaries, the safe operating limits for different components of the earth system seen as critical to maintaining a stable holocene-like state.8 two of thesešclimate change and biosphere integrityšare considered \\ncore boundaries, meaning they have the potential on their own to push the \\nearth into a new state.9 humans have exceeded the safe operating space for both; the risk of crossing a critical threshold, destabilizing the earth system and exiting the holocene is no longer assuredly low.\\n10this is the anthropocene: human power at scale, without illusions of control and without fully grasping or heeding the consequences. through unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions and other actions, humans are pull\\n-ing themselves out of the relative stability of the current geological epoch into the uncertainty of a new one. the anthropocene is essentially a leap into the unknown. making a choice for sustainable human development, \\nbased on a country™s unique set of circumstances, is necessary. but it is not \\neasyšand it is made all the more dif˚cult when persistently high inequality, \\nin its many forms, with its corrosive effects, implies that both people and planet lose. choices rooted in inclusion and sustainability can turn the dam\\n-aging historical relationship between development and ecological footprints \\non its headšbreaking humanity free from old development approaches that simply will not work as it enters the brave new world of the

improved crop varieties, \\n\\nclimate change will cause signiˆcant declines in \\n\\naverage crop yields over the course of the 21st \\n\\ncentury in many regions. ˜e largest declines \\n\\nwill occur where food insecurity is already a \\n\\nthreat.\\n58 climate changeœrelated inequality is \\npartly a biophysical phenomenon of di˚eren\\n-tial exposure. in regions where natural climate

recent mod\\n-elling shows that poorer countries will gener\\n-ally experience weather-related changes before \\n\\nricher countries. regional heat extremes, for \\n\\nexample, are expected to change noticeably in \\n\\nafrica, large parts of india and most of south \\n\\namerica a˝er 1.5°c of warming, but mid-lat\\n-itude regions will not see such changes until \\n\\nglobal temperatures increase by about 3°c.\\n60climate-induced inequality is also a social \\nphenomenon. vulnerable people will suffer \\n\\nmore because, for instance, with less irrigation, \\n\\nyields are more weather dependent. with few\\n-er and less robust cereal market stabilization \\n\\nmechanisms, livelihoods can be volatile. with \\n\\nless income and wealth, poor people are less \\n\\nable to absorb spikes in food prices. with dis\\n-criminatory laws, marginalized groups are bur\\n-dened with compounding insecurities. climate \\n\\nchange is expected to exacerbate these and \\n\\nother vulnerabilities, its biophysical and social \\n\\ndimensions working in the same direction: \\n\\ntowards worsening inequality.\\n61recent modelling has started to capture the \\ninteraction between biophysical and

importance of exposure and vulnerability \\nas mechanisms for climate-related inequalities: \\ndisparities in the economic impacts of warm\\n-ing are driven more by di˚erences in exposure \\nthan di˚erences in underlying vulnerability. in \\nother words the negative impacts of warming \\ncut similarly across communities of all levels \\nof development. richer ones are not insulated \\nfrom warming because they are rich, and poorer \\nones are not uniquely vulnerable because they \\nare poor. part of the challenge is that exposure \\nto damaging temperatures is much more com\\n-mon in poor regions.\\n˜at study™s ˆndings, which imply a primacy \\nof exposure, correspond to those of another \\nrecent study on climate™s impacts on education \\nacross 29 countries, mostly in the

and unsettling, question: might climate \\nchange overwhelm response capacities, as typi\\n-cally conceived, across manyšperhaps allšlev\\n-els of human development? for countries where \\nclimate

\\nnegative effects of shocks.1 this sort of adaptation occurs \\nin all societies in different ways.however, when events fall outside of the histori\\n-cal norm, there is signi˚cant unpredictability

experience).2with climate change the basic structure of shocks does not disappear but evolves into a different process. current policy frameworks may become incomplete. some effects of climate change might take the form of ﬁblack swans,ﬂ low-probability but high-impact events to which both public and private institutions are ill-pre-pared to respond. in other cases the effects are com-pletely

\\nand unequal power relationships, as well as \\n˙awed water management policies that exacer\\n-bate scarcity.ﬂ\\n131water footprints are one way to understand \\nand measure human use of water. every country \\nhas a national water footprint, the amount of \\nwater produced or consumed per capita. ˜e \\nfootprint includes virtual water, which is the \\nwater used in the production of such goods as \\nfood or industrial products. across countries, \\nagriculture constitutes the single greatest com\\n-ponent (92˛percent) of the water consumption \\nfootprint, with cereals the largest subcompo\\n-nent (27˛percent), followed by meat (22˛per\\n-cent) and milk products (7˛percent).\\n132 because \\nthe national water footprint of consumption \\nincludes imported virtual water, some coun\\n-tries have water footprints much larger than \\nmight be expected based on national water re\\n-source endowments alone. ˜e transboundary \\nmovement of virtual water is signiˆcant. over \\n1996œ2005 about one-ˆ˝h of the global water \\nfootprint was bound up in exported goods, \\nwith trade in crops the lion™s share.\\n133water footprints vary considerably across \\ncountries. ˜e widest variation is for developing \\ncountries. indeed, some of them have national \\nwater footprints of consumption on par, or \\nexceeding, those in developed countries.\\n134 ˜e \\nhigh water

within countries. consider access to \\nsafe drinking water and sanitation, where \\nsignificant inequalities persist between and \\nwithin countries. gaps in coverage between \\nrural and urban areas have long been impor\\n-tant. globally, over the past two decades the \\ngaps have narrowed, falling from 47˛percentage \\npoints to 32 for safely managed water services \\nand from 14˛percentage points to 5 for safely \\nmanaged sanitation services. in many countries \\ninequalities by wealth are signiˆcant. in some, \\nbasic water and sanitation coverage for the \\nwealthiest quintile is at least twice that for the \\npoorest quintile (ˆgure˛5.12). for water, wealth \\ninequalities generally exceed urban-rural ones \\nwithin the same country. while water and sani\\n-tation coverage has generally improved over the \\npast two decades across most, but not all, coun\\n-tries, inequalities by wealth have shown no such \\ngeneral trend. in some countries inequalities \\nhave declined; in others they have increased.\\n137as with urban-rural divides, national averages \\ncan mask di˚erences and deprivations at lower \\nlevels. in south africa the national gini index \\nfor piped water is .36, but this varies consid\\n-erably across the country™s provinces, from \\n.06 (least unequal) to .57 (most unequal).\\n138 reducing inequality in water access and use can\\n-not mean denying

generate demand for labour. for \\nexample, artiˆcial intelligence can deˆne more \\ndetailed and individualized teaching needs and \\nthus generate more demand for teachers to pro\\n-vide a wider range of education services.\\n25 more \\ngenerally, technological change can be directed \\nto both reduce inequality and promote envi\\n-ronmental sustainability.\\n26can artiˆcial intelligence

of capabilities. \\n˜e cleavages that may open are not necessarily \\nbetween developed and developing countries \\nor between people at the top and people at \\nthe bottom of the income distribution.

only a partial perspec\\n-tive, given the inequalities in leveraging new \\ntechnologies, having a seat at the table in the \\ndevelopment of these technologies and being \\ntrained or reskilled for working with them. \\n˜ere are also gender disparities, with women \\n200    |    \\nhuman development report \\n2019\\nin more empowering areas of technology, \\ninvolving access to more information

access to \\nand use of advanced ones.\\nin fact, the ability to access and use digital \\ntechnologies has a deˆning role both in the \\npattern of production and consumption and \\nin how societies, communities and even house\\n-holds are organized. more and more dependsš\\nto a great extentšon the ability to connect to \\ndigital networks. ˜is section shows that:\\nł groups with lower human

the \\navailability of bandwidth mattered little when \\nthere was only ˆxed-line telephony, since all \\nthe connections had essentially the same band\\n-width. but as artiˆcial intelligence and related \\ntechnologies continue to evolve, bandwidth \\nwill be increasingly important (as will be cloud \\ncomputing, which depends on the ability to \\nconnect computers with each other). access to

and responsibly provided ˚nan\\n-cial services in a well regulated environment.1 mobile money, digital identi˚cation and e-commerce have given \\nmany more people the ability to save money and trans-act business securely without needing cash, to insure against risks and to borrow to grow their businesses and reach new markets.in 2017, 69˛percent of adults had an account with a \\n˚nancial institution, up 7˛percentage points from 2014.\\n2 that means more than half a billion adults gained ac-cess to ˚nancial tools in three years.well known examples of mobile moneyšplat\\n-forms that allow users to send, receive and store mon-ey using a mobile phonešinclude kenya™s m-pesa and \\nchina™s alipay. mobile money has brought ˚nancial \\nservices to people long ignored by traditional banks. it \\nreaches remote regions without physical bank branch-es. it can also help women access ˚nancial servic\\n-esšan important aspect of equality, since women in \\nmany countries are less likely than men to have a bank \\naccount.3increases in e-commerce have also been dramatic, in-cluding individuals and small businesses selling products \\nand services on online platforms. in particular, inclusive \\ne-commerce, which promotes the participation of small \\n˚rms in the digital economy, is important because it can \\ncreate new opportunities for traditionally excluded groups. \\nin china, for example, an estimated 10˛million small and \\nmedium enterprises sell on the taobao platform; nearly \\nhalf the entrepreneurs on the platform are women, and \\nmore than 160,000 are people with disabilities.4from arti˚cial intelligence to cryptography, innova\\n-tion in ˚nancial technology is transforming the ˚nancial \\nsector globally.\\n5 while ˚nancial technology offers many \\npotential bene˚ts, there are also considerable concerns \\nabout these new technologies™ vulnerabilities. blockchain \\ntechnology, for one, provides applications that include a \\nsecure digital infrastructure to verify identity, facilitate \\nfaster and cheaper cross-border payments and protect \\nproperty rights. but these technologies bring new risks \\nthat are not fully

greatly, and di˚erent occupations have \\ndifferent resulting levels of susceptibility \\n(table˛6.1).\\n78some occupations have several tasks that \\ncould be easily replaced by artiˆcial intelli\\n-gence bundled with other tasks that are di˘\\n-cult or impossible for machines to replace. a \\nradiologist™s task of checking medical images \\nto identify anomalies can be performed by \\nartiˆcial intelligence, but a machine cannot \\nset priorities, consult with the medical team, \\nmake treatment plans or communicate with \\npatients and familyšall tasks the radiolo\\n-gist

\\nwith wages.\\n80 so it is not inevitable that artiˆ\\n-cial intelligence will replace or depress wages \\nin certain occupations, as some argue about \\nprevious waves of automation.\\n81a human-centred agenda thus requires atten\\n-tion to technology™s broader role in advancing \\ndecent work. technology can free workers from \\ndrudgery and arduous labour. ˜ere is even \\npotential

including detailed job-cra˝ing discus\\n-sions between workers and management.\\n82intelligence augmentation (using computers \\nto extend people™s ability to process informa\\n-tion and reason about complex problems) \\nmeans that artificial intelligence, instead of \\naiming at automation, can integrate human \\nagency and automation in a way that enhanc\\n-es both. ˜e augmentation can take place in \\neveryday human tasks. ˜is happens already \\nin spelling and grammar checking in word \\nprocessors, which highlight text to correct \\nerrors, and in autocompletions of text input in \\ninternet search engines. automatic suggestions, \\neasily dismissible, can accelerate the search and \\nreˆne ambiguous queries. ˜ese provide value, \\npromoting e˘ciency, accuracy and the consid\\n-eration of alternate possibilities. ˜ey augment, \\nbut do not replace, user interaction.\\n83finally, the recent advances in artificial \\nintelligence do not increase artiˆcial general \\nintelligence that could substitute machines for \\nall aspects of human cognition. artiˆcial in\\n-telligence has been very e˚ective at one aspect \\nof intelligence: prediction.\\n84 but prediction \\nis only an input into decisionmaking. the \\ndecision task is broader, requiring the collection \\nand organization of data, the ability to take an \\naction based on a decision and the judgement \\nto evaluate the payo˚s associated with di˚erent \\noutcomes. for individual workers, advances in \\nartiˆcial intelligence will matter to the degree \\nthat prediction is a core skill in the tasks that \\nmake up their occupation. ˜e diagnosis that a \\nradiologist provides can also be partially made \\nby artiˆcial intelligence, but that is very di˚er\\n-ent from a decision on the

points to the need for \\nregulation.\\n90 governments increasingly use \\nartiˆcial intelligence themselves, and some are \\ndeveloping data ethics principles (box˛6.4). \\nwhen artiˆcial intelligence systems inform \\ndecisionmaking that a˚ects humans (such as \\nmedical diagnosis or providing a judge with \\nan assessment of potential recidivism), avoid\\n-ing bias and errors across di˚erent contexts \\nand communities is especially important. and \\ngiven the global application and reach of many \\nartiˆcial intelligence innovations, collective \\naction may be needed at some point on some \\nregulatory aspects.\\nbox 6.3arti˚cial intelligence and the risk of bias: making horizontal inequalities worse?arti˚cial intelligence applications have the potential to support positive social changešindeed, in some do\\n-mains their impact could be revolutionary. but as with \\nany new technology, actually achieving these positive \\nresults is challenging and risky.\\nmany groups of people across the globe may be on the receiving end of arti˚cial intelligence™s downside. \\nthey may lose their jobs as more tasks are performed \\nby machine learningševen if net job loss is contained, inequalities in income and wealth could rise, and the quality of jobs fall. workers may see strong biases \\nagainst their skin colour or gender embedded in ma\\n-chine learning, and they may be subjects of surveillance. algorithms for job matching may reproduce historical bi-ases and prejudices. companies need policies on trans\\n-parency and data protection so that workers know what is being tracked. regulation may be needed to govern data use and algorithm accountability in the world of work.as uses of arti˚cial intelligence become pervasive, questions arise about the rise of propaganda and manip\\n-ulation, undermining democracy, and about surveillance \\nand the loss of privacy. for example, arti˚cial intelli\\n-gence applications are linked with the development of smart cities.1 this involves collecting data from cameras and sensors on a large scale. how does this differ from mass surveillance?machine learning algorithms are not biased inher-ently; they learn to be biased. algorithmic bias occurs when the learning algorithm is trained on biased da-tasets and subsequently ﬁaccuratelyﬂ learns the pat-terns of bias in the data.2 in some cases the learned representations within machine learning algorithms can even exaggerate these biases.3 for example, women are less likely to receive targeted ads for high-paying jobs potentially because the algorithm that targets the ads \\ntrained on data in which women had lower paying jobs.4 and a computer programme used in the united states to assess the risk of reoffending by individuals in the crim-inal justice system incorrectly ˜agged black defendants as high risk nearly twice as often as white defendants.5facial recognition services can be much less accu\\n-rate in identifying women or people with darker skin.6the well recognized lack of diversity among the \\npeople designing and developing arti˚cial intelligence \\nis another problem. few women work in arti˚cial intel-ligence, as in the tech sector in general, and among the \\nmen, racial diversity is limited.7 diverse teams, bringing diverse perspectives, representative of the general pop-ulation, could check biases.notes\\n1.˛glaeser

inequalities \\nin both basic and enhanced capabilities, the \\nframework includes two blocks (ˆgure˛7.1). \\n˜e ˆrst block (the one on the le˝ in ˆgure˛7.1) \\nencompasses policies towards the convergence \\nand expansion of capabilities, looking beyond \\nincome.\\n1 ˜e policy goals are to accelerate con\\n-vergence in basic capabilities while reversing \\ndivergences in enhanced capabilities and elim\\n-inating gender and other horizontal inequali\\n-ties. ˜e timing of many of these policies along \\nthe lifecycle matters, in relation to when they \\nhave an impact over the course of people™s lives. \\n˜e earlier in life some policies are pursued, the \\nless interventions may be needed through other \\npolicies (which may be both more expensive \\nand less e˚ective) later in life.\\n˜e second block (the one on the right in \\nˆgure˛7.1) considers policies for the inclusive \\nexpansion of income. the policy objective \\nis to jointly advance equity and e˘ciency in \\nmarkets, increasing productivity that translates \\ninto widely shared growing incomesšredress\\n-ing income inequality. ˜e framework is based \\npolicies for reducing inequalities in human development in the 21st century: we have a choice\\nthree trends in inequalities in human development are revealed by looking beyond income and beyond averages. they frame the context for policies as we look beyond today to a world of mounting impacts of climate change and revolutionary advances in technology:ł inequalities in basic capabilities are falling (some quite rapidly) but remain high, with many people still left behind. \\nmoreover, the pace of convergence is not fast enough to eradicate extreme deprivations, as called for in the sustainable \\ndevelopment goals (sdgs).ł inequalities in human development are growing in areas likely to be central to people over the next decades. inequality \\nin enhanced capabilitiesšthose fast-becoming essential as we move to the 2020sšare increasing, both between and \\nwithin countries.ł inequalities in the distribution of opportunities between men and women have improved, but further progress may get \\nharder, as the challenge of gender equality moves from basic to enhanced capabilities. there is even evidence of back\\n-lash in some countries.the framework is \\nmultidimensional, \\nemphasizing the \\nintrinsic importance \\nof indivisible human \\nfreedoms: redressing \\ninequalities in basic and \\nenhanced capabilities \\nis the overarching \\nintended outcomeon an integrated approach, because the two \\nblocks of policies are interdependent. policies \\nto advance capabilities beyond income o˝en \\nrequire resources to fund government pro\\n-grammes, which are ˆnanced by taxes. and the \\noverall resources available are, in turn, linked to \\nproductivity, which is linked in part to people™s \\ncapabilities. ˜e two blocks can thus work to\\n-gether in a virtuous policy cycle.\\n˜e framework is multidimensional, empha\\n-sizing the intrinsic importance of indivisible \\nhuman freedoms: redressing inequalities in \\nbasic and enhanced capabilities is the over\\n-arching intended outcome. thus, it is not \\nconsistent with the reduction of inequalities in \\nsome capabilities at the expense of the drastic \\ndeterioration of others. or with approaches \\nthat either reduce living standardsœcompro\\n-mising sustainable growth through ill-designed \\ndistributive policiesœor that simply pursue the \\ncreation of wealth while violating human rights \\nand our planet™s sustainability.\\nmultidimensionality also allows a better \\nintegration of the instrumental analysis of \\nincome and nonincome mechanisms behind \\nthe formation and progressive equalization of \\ncapabilities. ˜e policy cycle can be described \\nas one composed of premarket policies (pri\\n-marily within the block on the le˝ of ˆgure˛7.1 \\non nonincome capabilities and feeding into \\nthe block on the right), in-market policies \\n(predominantly in the right block on inclusive \\nincome expansion) and postmarket policies \\n(which connect the right block back to the \\nle˝). wages, proˆts and labour participation \\nrates are typically determined in markets, \\nwhich are conditioned by prevailing regula\\n-tions, institutions and policies (in-market). \\nbut those outcomes also depend on policies \\nthat a˚ect people before they become active in \\nthe economy (premarket). premarket policies \\ncan reduce disparities in capabilities, help\\n-ing everyone enter the labour market better \\nequippedševen though it is important to \\nemphasize that this is far from the only reason \\nwhy capabilities matter and that by enhancing \\ncapabilities the contributions to expanding \\nincomes go beyond participating in the labour \\nmarket (they can, for instance, enhance polit\\n-ical participation). in-market policies a˚ect \\nthe distribution of income and opportunities \\nwhen individuals are working, shaping out\\n-comes that can be either more or less inclusive. \\npostmarket policies a˚ect inequalities once the \\nmarket, along with in-market policies, have \\ndetermined the distribution of income and op\\n-portunities. ˜ese sets of policies interact. ˜e \\nprovision of public services premarket may \\ndepend in part on the e˚ectiveness of postmar\\n-ket policies (taxes on market income to fund \\nhealth and education, for instance), which \\nmatter in mobilizing government revenue to \\npay for those services. and taxes, in turn, are \\ninformed by how much society is willing to \\nredistribute income from those with more to \\nthose with less.\\n2figure 7.1a framework for designing policies to redress inequalities in human

socioemo\\n-tional development improved substantially between 2010 and 2014, especially for children from poorer fam-ilies. positive parenting was measured by survey ques-tions that ask caregivers how

\\nprofessionals and standardized the processes \\nfor certifying them. brazil and ethiopia broad\\n-ened their health professional recruitment \\npools for health extension and o˚ered more \\nflexible career opportunities to community \\nhealth workers.\\n25box 7.3the persistence of health gradients even with universal health coverageeven countries with low income inequality and universal \\nhealth coverage have not eliminated gradients in health. sweden has an outstanding health care system, with broad coverage, minimal out-of-pocket costs and spe\\n-cial help for vulnerable groups. but this equal access to health care does not produce equal health outcomes. \\nfor example:ł mortality rates in sweden are strongly correlated with socioeconomic status. at the bottom more than 40˛percent of people die by age˛80, compared \\nwith fewer than 25˛percent at the top. people of \\nlower socioeconomic status are twice as likely as those at the top to suffer from heart attacks, lung cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart failure.\\nł only 10˛percent of women from bottom-income \\nhouseholds in sweden receive the vaccination against human papillomavirus, compared with 40˛percent of women from top-income households.ł risky births are more common in poorer families in sweden, since more than 30˛percent of mothers in \\nthe bottom 1˛percent smoke before or during preg\\n-nancy compared with only 5˛percent of mothers in \\nthe top group.such persistent inequality in health outcomes can be \\naccounted for in part by unequal access to health exper-tise outside the formal health system. some policies that \\ncould mimic family access to health professionals include \\nlong-term visiting-nurse programmes, making more gen-eral practitioners available and ensuring that more pro-viders are culturally compatible with their communities, \\nsince this increases trust. such policies would be even \\nmore effective if targeted at the poorest.source: \\nhuman

policies can reduce horizontal inequalities. but there is also a risk that targeted policies further reinforce group differences or grievances, since members receive bene˜ts precisely because of their group identityaddressing horizontal inequalities: \\nfocus on gender inequality\\nuniversal policies can provide basic ˙oors but \\nmay not be enough to eliminate horizontal \\ninequalities. the latter are often rooted in \\nlong-standing social norms and social exclu\\n-sion. social exclusion happens when people are \\nunable to fully participate in economic, social \\nand political life because they are excluded on \\nthe basis of cultural, religious, racial or other \\nreasons.\\n26 ˜is may mean a lack of voice, lack \\nof recognition or lack of capacity for active \\nparticipation. it may also mean exclusion from \\ndecent work, assets, land, opportunities, access \\nto social services or political representation.\\n27when there are large horizontal inequalities, \\ntargeted or affirmative action policies that \\ndirectly support disadvantaged groupsšfor ex\\n-ample, the provision of access to credit, schol\\n-arships or certain group quotas in employment \\nand educationšcan complement universal \\npolicies. several historical examples show that \\na combination of universal and targeted pol\\n-icies can reduce horizontal inequalities.\\n28 but \\nthere is also a risk that targeted policies further \\nreinforce group di˚erences or grievances, since \\nmembers receive benefits precisely because \\nof their group identity. targeted policies are \\nparticularly relevant when a group has clearly \\nbeen disadvantaged historically,\\n29 with policies \\nhaving a deˆned timeframe so that they are ap\\n-plied only as long as the targeted group is truly \\ndisadvantaged. clear communication about \\nthe policies is crucial to prevent grievances and \\nfeelings of disadvantage.\\ngiven that gender remains one of the most \\nprevalent bases of discrimination, policies \\naddressing deep-seated discriminatory norms \\nand harmful gender stereotypes, prejudices \\nand practices are key for the full realization \\nof women™s human rights.\\n30 policies can target \\nsocial norms directly. interventions to change \\nunequal power relationships among individuals \\nwithin a community or to challenge deeply \\nrooted gender roles can be achieved through \\neducation, by raising awareness or by changing \\nincentives. education and raising awareness are \\nboth based on providing individuals with new \\ninformation and knowledge that can foster \\ndi˚erent values and behaviours. such initiatives \\nmight include formal education, workplace \\ntraining or media campaigns against gender \\nstereotyping. to change incentives, protective \\nmechanisms can confront possible harm due \\nto traditional gender norms or a backlash, such \\nas school bullying or workplace harassment. \\nchanging incentives can also be introduced \\nto delay early marriage and reduce teenage \\npregnancies. ˜e three dimensions (education, \\nawareness, incentives) o˝en reinforce each oth\\n-er, as the examples of policies included in this \\nsection suggest.\\nfor example, québec™s 2006 nontransfer\\n-able parental leave for fathers shi˝ed incen\\n-tives so that fathers became more involved in \\nhome caregiving. with new beneˆts fathers \\nincreased their participation in parental leave \\nby 250˛percent,\\n31\\n contributing to reverse the \\nsocial norm that expected mothers to take sole \\nresponsibility for care work. and in households \\nwhere men had the opportunity to use the ben\\n-eˆt, fathers™ daily time in household work was \\n23˛percent higher than in households where \\nnew fathers did not participate, long a˝er the \\nleave period ended.\\n32\\n ˜is example also shows \\nthe importance of including men in gender \\nequality policies. in fact, according to a survey \\nof organisation for economic co-operation \\nand development (oecd) countries on \\nimplementing gender strategies or policies, \\nalmost everyone considers changing men™s and \\nboys™ attitudes towards care activities to be the \\nˆrst priority.\\n33 yet, even though the importance \\nof adequately engaging men and boys in over\\n-coming gender inequality or addressing their \\nown gender-related vulnerabilities is widely \\nacknowledged, public policies have yet to fully \\nconsider that dimension.\\n34˜us, laws and regulations can balance the \\ndistribution of care work in householdsšsay, \\nby increasing the duration of paid parental \\nleave, as in the québec example. but only \\nabout half of the countries in the world o˚er \\npaternity leave in addition to maternity leave, \\nand half of those o˚er fewer than 3 weeks for \\nfathers and 80˛percent offer fewer than 14 \\nweeks for mothers.\\n35 moreover, it is not enough \\nfor the policy to be gender-neutral; it must \\nexplicitly target men (as in québec), precisely \\nbecause otherwise social norms may prevail, \\nimpeding people from taking leave. in 2007 the \\nrepublic of korea started to reserve a year of \\npaternal leave, and by 2014

where \\nparents receive a small gender-equality ˆnan\\n-cial bonus for every day they use parental leave \\nequally. ˜is way, fathers™ share of childcare \\nduring the early months or years of a

particular\\n-ly for children, is crucial precisely because much \\nof the di˚erence in earnings throughout the li\\n-fecycle is generated before age˛40, leading wom\\n-en to miss many labour market opportunities \\nduring the early stages of their careers.\\n37 ˜ese \\nmissed opportunities coincide with childbirth, \\nwhich can encourage women to withdraw from \\nthe labour market. o˚ering access to a˚ordable \\nchildcare can provide mothers opportunities to \\nmake their own work-life decisions, allowing \\nthem to engage in paid work. mothers tend to \\nadjust their choices around paid work to the \\ndemands of childcare.\\n38 hence, accessible and \\na˚ordable childcare is relevant for mothers™ \\nfreedom to engage in paid work.\\n39the impact of regulations and laws goes \\nbeyond changing the balance of care. policies \\nare important in areas ranging from protection \\nfrom violence and discrimination to access to \\npublic services. but the way in which policies \\nare designed and implemented is determined, \\nin part, by participation in politics. ˜us, af\\n-ˆrmative action quotas that increase minority \\nparticipation in politics can result in stronger \\ninstitutional commitment to equality and \\nnondiscrimination. even though tunisia is a \\nyoung democracy (its first constitution was \\nratiˆed in 2014), today it has one of the world™s \\nmost progressive gender parity laws. it has leg\\n-islated candidate, constitutional and electoral \\nlaw quotas. ˜e regulations guarantee equal \\nopportunities for women and men at all levels \\nof

\\nef˜cient labour markets\\nmost people receive income from work (a few \\nalso from capital gains), which is determined to \\na great extent by how markets are organized and \\nregulated. ˜us, labour markets and the world \\nof work are important determinants of income \\ninequality. for instance, increases in labour \\nincome towards the bottom of the distribution \\nwere central in latin american countries that \\nreduced income inequality in the 2000s.\\n65markets are not a baseline on which govern\\n-ments intervene;\\n66 rather, they are embedded \\nin society (to use karl polanyi™s expression).\\n67 and market outcomes are shaped by a number \\nof policies and institutions, some of which are \\nconsidered in this section. for instance, unions \\nendow workers with the

to the fragmentation of \\nproduction associated with globalization un\\n-ionization has become more di˘cult, with the \\nin˙uence of unions declining in many coun\\n-tries,\\n69 although with

\\ngiven workers™ lack of alternative employment \\nopportunities. in some cases ˆrms can cooper\\n-ate to reduce wages even further.\\n79 monopsony \\nis more prevalent when the geographical mo\\n-bility of labour is low, due either to laws such as \\nresidency requirements or to low skills of work\\n-ers, which makes them easily substitutable.\\npublic policy can play a key role in such \\ncases. although opinions are split on whether \\nminimum wages reduce employment in com\\n-petitive markets, when labour market power \\n234    |    \\nhuman development report \\n2019\\nis concentrated by ˆrms, minimum wages can \\nactually increase employment, when the min\\n-imum wage acts as a price ˙oor, preventing a \\nproˆt-maximizing ˆrm with monopsony power \\nfrom reducing wages through lower hiring.\\n80 ˜e positive e˚ect on employment and wages at \\nthe bottom is expected to reduce inequalities.\\nfurther e˚orts to reduce inequalities by check\\n-ing the labour market power of ˆrms are ham\\n-pered by the dearth of research and data on the \\ntopic of monopsony, especially compared with \\nresearch and data on monopoly. an internation\\n-ally comparable indicator and dataset on labour \\nmarket power would enable monitoring across \\ncountries and prompt action to reduce it. ˜ere \\nis ample scope for policy, since in some cases \\nworkers™ wages are marked down by 6˛percent or \\nmore from their marginal product.\\n81minimum wages can also be e˚ective in the \\ncontext of high informality. a common mis\\n-conception is that the informal sector, since it \\nhas no formal barriers to entry, is more compet\\n-itive than the formal sector. but the di˘culty \\nof enforcing contracts in the informal economy \\ncan create a holdup problem, where workers \\ncannot be certain they will be paid once the \\nwork is done. if this happens, employers in \\ninformal markets have considerable power over \\ntheir workers.\\n82 ˜is would turn on its head the \\nconcern that labour market regulations, such \\nas a minimum wage, could increase informal\\n-ity. when this mechanism holds, enforcing \\nbox 7.5gender equality in the labour

development outcomes, such as productivity, and \\nincreases economic diversi˚cation and income equality.\\n2policies that aim to mitigate gender biases and guarantee equal pay can promote economic growth and could be magni˚ed through a stronger presence of skilled women in the labour market.3 barriers to wom-en™s participation act as brakes on the national econo\\n-my, sti˜ing its ability to grow. so implementing policies \\nthat remove labour market distortions and create a level playing ˚eld for all would boost the demand for wom\\n-en™s labouršwith action also on the supply side to al\\n-low women to exercise their free choice to participate.4 these measures range from changes in discriminatory regulations and practices to ensuring gender equality in \\npay and fairer working conditions for women.modifying regulations could require employers to review their pay practices or to report gender gap cal-culations. since 2001 both france and sweden have asked employers to review their practices and develop \\nan annual plan for gender equality. australia, germany, \\njapan, sweden and the united kingdom require organ-izations with 250 or more employees to publish their \\ngender pay gap calculations.5 currently, equal pay for \\nequal work is constitutionally guaranteed in only 21˛per\\n-cent of countries.6other examples to improve the quality of working conditions include de˚ning identical criteria to promote \\nmen and women, having ˜exible working arrangements and increasing the supply of care options to broaden choices. in belgium, france, germany and new zealand all employees in companies of a certain size are enti-tled to request ˜exible working arrangements. japan and the republic of korea provide mothers and fathers \\none year of nontransferable paid parental leave each. \\nand nordic countries often reserve parts of the parental leave period for the exclusive use of each parent for a few months.7it is not enough to adopt these policies if they are not accompanied by training or awareness campaigns to \\nchange gender social norms. for the workplace it is very important to change attitudes towards caregiving and taking leave from work to care for dependents by men so that fathers who take leave are not stigmatized. this can help balance workloads at home and change atti-tudes towards gender roles in households. as in other dimensions, it is critical to engage men. one way is by establishing male role models to drive changes in gen\\n-der stereotypes. an alternative is to raise awareness through sensitivity training to recognize male privilege, discern signs of sexism and understand exclusion and \\nﬁmicromachismos.ﬂ8notes\\n1.˛cuberes and teignier 2012. 2.˛imf 2018. 3.˛agenor, ozdemir and moreira 2018.

disproportionately affect poor peoplea grasp of the distributive effects of competition is central to policymaking. poorer households are typically the most affected by market concentration because they consume a more homogeneous set of goods, have less op\\n-portunity to substitute consumption and have limited access to markets.\\n1 inducing more competition in concentrated markets could reduce poverty, \\nincrease household welfare2 and boost growth and productivity.\\nmexico is well known for its history of monopolies, including telmex \\nfor ˚xed-line communications (privatized in 1990) and an oligopoly in corn \\nproducts, an important household staple. plagued by low productivity and limited innovation that have resulted in high prices for consumers, these monopolies have become an integral part of mexico™s paradoxical growth, \\nleading to an average 98˛percent markup in goods across households, ac\\n-cording to recent estimates.3one study using the welfare and competition tool to simulate the dis\\n-tributional effects of a rise in competition in mobile telecommunications and \\ncorn products in mexico found that increasing competition from 4 to 12 ˚rms in the mobile telecommunications industry and reducing the market share of the oligopoly in corn products from 31.2˛percent to 7.8˛percent would reduce \\nthe poverty headcount by 0.8˛percentage point and the gini coef˚cient by \\n0.32 point (box˛˚gure˛1).4in mobile telecommunications relative gains are fairly evenly distribut-ed across income groups. for corn products a decline in market concentra\\n-tion would bene˚t households at the bottom of the income distribution more (in relative terms), since they allocate a larger share of their consumption to these products. corn is especially relevant in the diet for low-income groups in mexico, therefore, for households in the four lowest deciles, moving from a concentrated market to perfect competition would increase their average income by 1.6œ2.9˛percent (box˛˚gure˛2). by contrast, the increase among \\nhouseholds in the three highest deciles would be only about 0.4˛percent \\n(though the absolute impacts increase in higher income deciles).competition-enhancing policies that reduce concentration in key markets \\ncan bene˚t households. the hypothetical case shows that market concentra\\n-tion in key sectors of the mexican economy reduces welfare, especially among \\npoor and vulnerable households. moving towards competitive markets, among \\nthe main objectives of the mexican government, requires removing market

in-come and opportunity. a comparison of income inequal\\n-ity across advanced and emerging economies shows the redistributive role of direct tax and transfer systems (box˛˚gure˛1). while direct taxes and transfers in ad\\n-vanced economies reduce the gini coef˚cient by 0.17 point (from 0.48 to 0.31), they reduce it much less, by 0.04 (from 0.49 to 0.45), in emerging and developing economies, which include latin american countries with some of the highest income inequality in the world. so, on average, the redistributive impact of direct income taxes and transfers explains nearly all the difference in \\ndisposable income inequality between advanced and emerging economies.the redistributive reach of ˚scal policy is greater when the analysis includes the impact of in-kind public spending on education and health. for instance, rising spending on education has been instrumental in in-creasing access to education and reducing inequality of \\neducation outcomes. as more educated cohorts enter the labour market, income inequality decreases as the \\ninequality of education outcomes falls and the higher \\nhuman capital stock leads to a reduction in returns to high skills. the

\\nalways equalizing forces (measured as the mar\\n-ginal contribution to reduce inequality). even \\nindirect taxes equalize more o˝en than not. \\n˜e equalizing e˚ect of health and education \\nspending (including tertiary education in some \\ncountries) is particularly relevant: not only are \\nthey a more powerful equalizing force, but they \\nalso bolster human development

e˚ortšand di˚erences in \\nthe progressivity of taxes and transfersšthat is, \\nˆscal progressivity (see also spotlight 7.3 at the \\nend of the chapter).\\nfrom the perspective of fiscal effort, many \\ncountries have the scope to increase redistribu\\n-tion by increasing tax revenues. a recent study on \\nwhether (personal income) tax rates are optimal \\nfor maximizing revenues, which depends on how \\nresponsive revenues are to taxes, found that tax \\nrates were signiˆcantly below optimal levels in \\nall the countries examined, implying that they \\ncould raise tax rates and still increase revenue.\\n118 some studies have also found that the decreasing \\nprogressivity of taxation in many countries was \\nnot associated with higher economic growth.\\n119 hence, all the countries included in the study \\nhad room for more redistribution.\\n120but tax rates have been declining.\\n for exam\\n-ple, the top marginal personal income tax rate \\nhas tended to decline in both developed and \\ndeveloping countries over the past few decades \\n(ˆgure˛7.7). corporate income taxes have also \\nfallen since 1990, in both developed and devel\\n-oping countries.\\n121several domestic factors might explain to\\n-day™s low tax rates (chapter˛2).\\n122 and tax com\\n-petition among countries may also have been a \\nfactor, especially for corporate income taxes, as \\ndiscussed below.\\nrecent policy debates have returned to taxes \\non wealth, intended to both raise public revenue \\nand lower inequality (by ˙attening the wealth \\ngradient and by using the funds raised for pub\\n-lic social services expenditure or infrastructure \\ninvestment). ˜e advantage of taxing wealth, \\nespecially real estate, is that it is harder to hide \\nthan income, to a point. wealth taxation is also \\nvery progressive due to the very high concentra\\n-tion of wealth at the top. however, the reporting \\nof wealth could fall by as much as an estimated \\n15˛percent in response to such a tax. and of 12 \\ncountries with a wealth tax in the 1990s, only 3 \\n(in europe) still have the measure in place.\\n123\\n ˜is \\nis due partly to concerns about e˘ciency and

report \\n2019\\na more integrated global economy also requires international cooperation and rules to ensure fair play and to avoid a race to the bottom in taxeshowever, analysis of progressivity must go \\nbeyond the progressivity of individual taxesš\\nor even aggregate taxes. it is not enough to look \\nsolely at the progressivity of individual tax rates \\nbecause ˆscal systems are designed with both \\nrevenues and expenditures in mind. ˜e pro\\n-gressivity of net transfers is more informative \\nthan the progressivity of the individual taxes \\nand transfers. for example, even an e˘cient but \\nregressive taxšsuch as a typical value added \\ntaxšcan be equalizing if it is complemented by \\ntransfers that target poor people.\\n126assessments of fiscal redistribution should \\nthus consider both taxation and spending to\\n-gether.\\n127\\n public policy can also maximize the \\nimpact of redistribution through deliberate \\ndesign of how resources are allocated to di˚erent \\ngroups in society and to di˚erent areas of spend\\n-ing. fiscal policy should tilt towards greater \\nspending on the lower deciles, through more \\ntransfers (both direct and in kind) to the lower \\ndeciles or through greater spending on pro\\n-grammes to support disadvantaged groups and \\ncommunities. investments in public goodsš\\nincluding the education system, infrastructure, \\nsanitation and securityšcould also dispropor\\n-tionately beneˆt people in lower deciles who \\nwould otherwise not have access to such services.\\nregardless of the type of tax, support for \\nredistribution has strengthened since 1980šat \\nleast in oecd countries. ˜e oecd™s new \\nrisks that matter survey asked more than \\n22,000 people in 21 countries about their per\\n-ceptions of social and economic risks, how well \\nthey think their government addresses those \\nrisks and their desired policies and preferenc\\n-es for social protection. in almost all oecd \\ncountries more than half the respondentsš\\nespecially older and low-income onesšthink \\ntheir government should do more for their eco\\n-nomic and social security, though this does not \\nnecessarily imply support for higher tax rates.\\n128in sum, redistribution can be a powerful in\\n-strument to redress inequalities in both income \\nand capabilities. fiscal e˚ort is one part of this \\ntool. ˜e other side of redistribution is ˆscal \\nprogressivity, how net transfers are allocatedš\\nto whom they are transferred and how and on \\nwhat public services they are spent on and for \\nwhose beneˆt. decomposing these two aspects \\nshows great variationšand thus suggests mul\\n-tiple options for countries to consideršin the \\nmix of policies to pursue to redress inequality. \\nwhat is clear is

the increased integration of \\ncountries have meant more than just increased \\n˙ows of goods, services, ˆnance and people. \\ndecisions by corporations on how they struc\\n-ture their supply chains can shape investment, \\nproduction, trade, migration and taxation \\naround the world. global value chains deˆne \\nmodern manufacturing production especially \\nand in recent decades have been accompanied \\nby the distribution of research and develop\\n-ment\\n129 and other segments of the value chain. \\nmultinational corporations distribute activities \\nin cities and countries to take advantage of \\ndi˚erences in costs, availability of skills, inno\\n-vation capabilities and logistical advantages.\\nevidence suggests that the domestic spillo\\n-ver of global value chains have contributed to \\nsigniˆcant gains in productivity and incomes \\nin many economies.\\n130\\n ˜ere can also be an \\nassociation with increasing inequality in some \\ndeveloping countries, through the skill premi\\n-um, and in developed economies, if jobs are \\ndisplaced.\\n131\\n so a more integrated global econ\\n-omy also requires international cooperation \\nand rules to ensure fair play and to avoid a race \\nto the bottom in taxes (particularly corporate \\nincome taxes), disclosure and regulations.\\n132˜us, international tax cooperation must en\\n-sure that transparency is maintained in order to \\ndetect and deter tax evasion; that multinational \\ncorporations are prevented from shi˝ing proˆts \\nto no- or low-tax jurisdictions; that countries \\ncan get their fair share of taxes, especially with \\nthe advent of new digitally intensive business \\nmodels; and that countries, particularly devel\\n-oping countries, can develop capacities to deal \\nwith these challenges.\\n133wealthy people can use o˚shore centres to \\nhide their money and reduce their tax burdens. \\n˜e wealth of individuals in o˚shore centres \\nin 2014 was an estimated $7.6˛trillion,

large multi\\n-national corporations o˝en have an advantage \\nover national governments in determining how \\nmuch and where they pay their taxes. in august \\n2016 the european commission determined

government revenues \\nhave increased as tax rates have fallen.\\n137 where \\nthe proˆts thus attributed are not generated \\nby underlying economic activities, the practice \\nis harmful. in such

and nonpoor people.\\nin the end the road to universalism may \\ndepend on a combination of the three trajec\\n-tories, speciˆc to each context. for instance, \\ncountries where social insurance reaches less \\nthan 20˛percent of the population require a \\nvery different policy trajectory from those \\nwhere social insurance reaches more than \\n60˛percent. building broad support requires \\nthat revenues be generated from a diversity \\nof sources, including copayments for those \\nwho can a˚ord them, payroll contributions \\n(depending on the proportion of formal work\\n-ers) and general taxes. in countries with deep \\nhorizontal inequalities, it is also important to \\ncreate stakeholders in di˚erent communities \\nand to avoid the identiˆcation of services with \\nspeciˆc groups.\\nin developed countries the challenge may be \\nto keep social policies that provide enhanced \\ncapabilities to the broadest base. ˜ose systems \\nare sustainable to the extent that they work for \\nmost of the population, and particularly for the \\nmiddle classes. ˜at has been eroded recently in \\nsome oecd countries, where the middle class \\nperceives itself as progressively le˝ behind in \\nreal income, a˚ordable access to quality educa\\n-tion and health, and security.\\n151in developing countries the challenge is to so\\n-lidify social policies for a still vulnerable middle \\nclass. in latin america there is evidence that \\nthe middle class pays more than it receives in \\nsocial services. ˜at, coupled with perceptions of \\nlow-quality education and health services, feeds \\nresistance to further expanding social policies.\\n152 one consequence is the preference for private \\nproviders: ˜e share of students going to private \\nschool for primary

groups.\\n154 a natural response would be \\nto add resources from those at the top. but those \\ngroups, while a minority, have o˝en been an ob\\n-stacle to expanding universal services, using their

century: we have a choice\\n    |    247\\nbox s7.1.1being right is not enough: reducing inequality needs a movement from below ben phillips,author of the forthcoming bookhow to fight inequality (polity press, october 2020)it is a remarkable achievement. just a few years ago there was no consensus that inequality needed to be tackled. now inequality is recognized as harm\\n-ful and dangerous by mainstream economists, the international monetary \\nfund, the organisation for economic co-operation and development and the world bank. and all governments have, in adopting the sustainable \\ndevelopment goals, pledged to reduce inequality.\\nbut winning on words has not meant winning on action. inequalities continue to worsen, and the broad thrust of government action is at best insuf˚cient to address them. the mainstream consensus has shifted to rec\\n-ognize the inequality crisis without a suf˚cient shift in action. the problem in beating inequality is not being unsure of what needs to be done; it is not \\ngathering the collective power to overcome those stopping it.some leaders made commitments to tackle inequality without a determined \\nintention to implement them, but even when leaders are more inclined to effect \\nchange, they cannot act without the wind at their back that ordinary people, \\nwhen organized, can give them. remember the story of us president lyndon \\njohnson telling martin luther king, jr., ﬁi know what i have to do, but you have \\nto make me do it.ﬂ politicians are under so much pressure from the ever more \\npowerful 1˛percent that even the best-intentioned ones need pressure.inequality is so hard to break because it is a vicious cycle. the power im-balance that comes with the concentration of wealthšand its interaction with \\npolitics, economics, society and narrativešenables the further concentration \\nof wealth and a worsened power imbalance. the imbalance of power is what \\nmatters for ˚xing the injustice. as history showsšin the birth of the european \\nwelfare state, the us new deal and great society, free education in kenya, the \\nnational rural employment guarantee act in india, free hiv medicines in south \\nafrica and the declines in inequality in latin america in the early 21st centuryš\\nthe momentum for action to tackle inequality requires pressure from below.\\nhow can inequality be beaten again? three key lessons stand out from \\nresearch and observation.overcome deferencethe ˚rst lesson is to overcome deference. john lewis, who helped lead \\nthe us civil rights movement, describes how, as a child, he was urged by \\nhis mother, ﬁdon™t get in the way; don™t get in trouble.ﬂ but as a teenager, \\ninspired by activists ˚ghting inequality, he realized that making change re\\n-quired him to ﬁget in trouble, good trouble, necessary trouble.ﬂ so too with \\nsouth africa™s treatment action campaign for access to antiretroviral med\\n-icines, the gambia™s has decided movement to ensure that the loser of the \\nelection there stood down as promised and bolivia™s landless workers, who \\ndemanded access to land. all were treated as troublemakers before they \\nwere recognized for prompting needed change. so too were the suffragettes, \\nwho struggled for women™s right to vote. resistance does not always work, \\nbut acceptance never works. and no one gets to initiate major social shifts \\nwithout being criticizedšthat is part of the journey to greater equality.\\nbuild collective powerthe second lesson is to build collective power by organizing. as the saying \\ngoes, ﬁthere is no justice, just us.ﬂ but ﬁjust usﬂšorganizedšis powerful. jay \\nnaidoo, who led the trade union movement that helped bring down apartheid \\nin south africa, emphasized that ﬁpower is built at the grassroots, village by \\nvillage, street by street.ﬂ organizing is not just about marches. it is about the \\nwhole process, about what happens between the most visible moments. it is \\nabout people forming groups so they can be strong enough to act and be harder \\nto ignore, suppress or exploit because they have collective power. in nepal the \\nmahila adhikar manch, a grassroots women™s movement, started as communi\\n-ty- and district-level women™s forums, organizing local campaigns on violence \\nagainst women. after six years of grassroots actions, community leaders came \\ntogether for two days™ deliberations and formed a national secretariat. since \\nthen mahila adhikar manch has grown to be a membership-based organization \\nthat has spread to more than 30 districts with 50,000 members.old divides across groups need to be broken down to form a winning coali-tion. the usawa (ﬁequalityﬂ) festival in nairobi deliberately brings together rural \\nand urban, young and old of all communities in a common celebration and plan-ning process, because only by breaking down barriers and building community \\ncan it build the unity needed for change. so too the dividing line between unions \\nand social movements has never been wide when they have been at their most \\neffective. the movement in el salvador to protect water as a public good has \\nbeen effective, its leaders note, only because it brought together such a broad \\nrange of the church, social movements, academics, resident groups and non-governmental organizationsša narrower coalition would not have been strong \\nenough to win. william barber ii calls these movements ﬁfusion coalitionsﬂ \\nbecause their power comes from bringing so many different groups together.\\nbuild a new storythe third lesson is to build a new story of society. previous victories against in\\n-equality built one, and a new one is needed again. such a new story will not be \\nbuilt in policy papers. the mexican social movement secured the passing of a \\nlabour law reform, ensuring domestic workers access to social security and the \\nright to paid holidays, due in part to the popularity of the movie roma, which \\nhas no explicit policy message but moved millions to understand with greater \\nempathy the likes of domestic workers. similarly, a new narrative is needed \\nto shift from the old millennium development goals to the new sustainable \\ndevelopment goals, which embody a new vision of mutuality. but it requires \\na new narrative to bring it alive. possible parts of the story might assert that a \\ngood society is about the values we want to live by and the relationships we \\nwant to have, that we need a ceiling as well as a ˜oor and that our society and \\neconomy are something we build together. in laudato si pope francis set out a \\nvision of community over competition, dignity over materialism.the shift in recognizing the problem of inequality and the formal commit\\n-ment to tackle it have been necessary but insuf˚cient conditions for tackling \\ninequality. likewise, analysis of the trends and impacts of inequality and pol\\n-icy advice on how to tackle it are vitally important but not enough. the one \\ngeneralizable lesson of social change seems to be that no one saves others; \\npeople liberate themselves by standing together. change can be slow, and it \\nis always complicated and sometimes failsšbut it is the only way it works. \\nchange is not given; it is won. by overcoming deference, building collective \\npower and building a new story, inequality can beat inequality.\\n 248    |    \\nhuman development report \\n2019\\nspotlight 7.2\\nproductivity and equity while ensuring environmental sustainability\\n˜e analysis in this chapter assumes room for \\neconomic growth along pathways that combine \\nequity and increases in productivity. but over \\nthe next decades countries will face demands \\nfor di˚erent patterns of development to keep \\nglobal warming below 2°c.\\n1so countries may need to recalibrate the tools \\nused to promote both equity and productivity \\nin a more sustainable way, and new opportu\\n-nities may lay therein.\\n2 ˜e question is how to \\nmake room for the expansion of productivity \\nin a way that does not destroy the planet. ˜e \\nconsensus expressed by the intergovernmental \\npanel on climate change is that the world \\nneeds to decarbonize the economy, reaching \\nnet zero emissions by mid-century.\\n3 this \\nrequires a shi˝ in patterns of consumption, \\nemployment and production and in the struc\\n-ture of government taxes and transfers, with \\nsigniˆcant implications for the distribution of \\nincome and human development.\\ntake, for instance, carbon pricesšeither \\nthrough a carbon tax or a market-based emis\\n-sions trading scheme. by raising the relative \\nprice of carbon-emitting activities to better \\nre˙ect the social damages of carbon, incen\\n-tives to produce less carbon would be in place. \\n˜e united states pioneered successful mar\\n-ket-based trading schemes for some pollutants, \\nnotably sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and \\nleaded gasoline.\\n4 ˜e largest emissions trading \\nscheme for carbon is the european union \\nemission trading scheme, but other jurisdic\\n-tions are either planning or considering carbon \\npricing as a way to meet their commitments un\\n-der the paris agreement of the united nations \\nframework convention on climate change, \\nwhich represents 55˛percent of greenhouse \\ngas emissions.\\n5 still, only about 20˛percent of \\nglobal greenhouse gas emissions are covered by \\none of the 57 carbon pricing initiatives either \\nin operation or scheduled for implementa\\n-tion.\\n6 administered across 46 national and \\n28 subnational jurisdictions, these initiatives \\ngenerated approximately $44˛billion in 2018, \\nup $11˛billion from 2017.\\n7 carbon prices vary \\nwidely, from less than $1 per tonne of carbon \\ndioxide equivalent to $127.\\n8 only 5˛percent of \\ngreenhouse gas emissions are covered by a car\\n-bon price considered high enough to achieve \\nthe goals of the paris agreement.\\n9 about half \\nof emissions covered by carbon pricing are \\npriced at less than $10 per tonne of carbon di\\n-oxide equivalent, well below what is considered \\nnecessary to ˆght climate change.\\n10raising the price of carbon, seen in isola\\n-tion, may be considered regressive since poor \\npeople generally spend a greater share of their \\nincome on energy-intensive goods and services \\nthan rich people do.\\n11 some research paints \\na more nuanced picture: an inverse u-shape \\nrelationship between energy expenditure share \\nand income, leading to suggestions that carbon \\npricing can, on average, be regressive for coun\\n-tries with an income per capita above roughly \\n$15,000 but progressive for poorer countries.\\n12 however, the inequality impact of ˆscal re\\n-distribution measures should not be seen as \\npiecemeal and isolated from how the collected \\nfunds are to be used and how the incidence of \\ntaxes is implemented, as discussed in chapter˛7. \\nnothing mechanical determines that pricing \\ncarbon must be regressive.\\ncarbon pricing can, for instance, reduce \\ninequality if the revenues from a carbon tax are \\nreturned to taxpayers according to a budget-neu\\n-tral concept called revenue recycling. one study \\nin the united states showed that if just 11˛per\\n-cent of revenues were returned to the bottom \\nincome quintile, those households would not be \\nworse o˚ on average.\\n13 ˜e ˆscal transfer could \\nbe increased, either through cash transfers or tax \\ncredits, to reduce inequality as carbon emissions \\nfell. reductions in energy subsidies function \\nsimilarly to the introduction of a carbon tax \\nbecause both increase the price of fossil fuels. a \\nstudy in india showed that phasing out energy \\nsubsidies and returning the government savings \\nto people in the form of a universal basic income \\nwould be progressive, signiˆcantly beneˆting the \\npoorest, who typically spend far less on energy \\nthan the richest do.\\n14where ambitious emission reduction targets \\nare set, carbon pricing can generate sustained \\nchapter 7\\n policies for reducing inequalities in human development in the 21st century: we have a choice\\n    |    249\\nrevenues over decades that could also be spent \\non other important areas, such as health and \\neducation.\\n15 and to the extent that those \\ninvestments disproportionately benefit poor \\nand vulnerable people, inequality in human \\ndevelopment could also decline. some revenue \\nrecycling options reduce inequalities more than \\nothers.\\n16 so carbon pricing using equity-promot\\n-ing revenue recycling options could be a triple \\nwin: a way to reduce carbon emissions, reduce \\nor avoid climate-related inequalities and reduce \\nother inequalities in human development.\\nwhere opportunities for equity-promoting \\nrevenue recycling face real-world constraints, \\nsome have argued for alternatives, such as \\nestablishing sector-specific carbon prices \\nsupplemented by regulation and public invest\\n-ments.\\n17 if higher carbon prices can be assigned \\nto di˚erent sectors or to di˚erent products and \\nuses where the rich tend to spend, lower carbon \\nprices can be set in areas where poor people \\nspend differentially. for a given emissions \\nreductions target a portfolio of di˚erentiated \\ncarbon prices, direct regulation and investment \\nmeans those with higher incomes will ex ante \\nbear more of the costs of compliance. such ap\\n-proaches can alleviate some of the undesirable \\ndistributional impacts of a single carbon price, \\nespecially where the ability to address distribu\\n-tional concerns ex post are limited.\\n˜e other side of the adjustment is in produc\\n-tion and employment. a drastic reduction in \\nfossil fuels implies the progressive reduction of \\njobs in those sectors. an international labour \\norganization study projected scenarios of de\\n-carbonization consistent with limiting global \\nwarming to 2°c (over preindustrial levels). it \\nfound that the net e˚ect on employment by \\n2030 would be positive, with 24˛million jobs \\ncreated and 6˛million jobs lost. going beyond \\nthe averages also applies to policies: even if the \\nworld is better o˚ in employment, the gains \\nand losses are not equally distributed, and some \\ncommunities will be more a˚ected than others. \\n˜e management of that dynamic can be very \\nconsequential for human development and for \\nthe political sustainability of the process.\\n18notes\\n1 some even argue that economic growth objectives may not \\nbe consistent with keeping

social welfare weight that is given \\nto different segments of the population \\n(the consumption of those who are \\nliving below the extreme poverty line, \\nfor example, has barely budged, even \\nthough many have been able to move \\nabove the line).7 for example, gaps in life expectancy \\nappear marked in the united states \\nacross socioeconomic groups, with \\nthose at the top of the

about how \\nconclusions about inequality can \\nchange depending on the de˚nition \\nof the indicator. in this chapter, \\nunless explicitly statedšas in \\nthe inequality-adjusted human \\ndevelopment indexšcomparisons \\nof inequality in human development \\ndepart from summary measures. they \\ncompare the achievements across \\ngroups (countries, castes, quintiles \\nbased on

\\nwith respect to an invariant base with \\nintrinsic valuešthe base is linked to \\npeople across indicators. in the case \\nof indicators based on ratios the base \\nrepresents people with access. in \\nthe case of life expectancy the base \\nrepresents years of human life. life \\nclaims should be universal (anand \\n2018). second, in the context of \\nbounded indicators this comparison \\nsatis˚es the mirror axiom (erreygers \\n2009), ensuring that conclusions are \\nrobust to changes in convention in the \\nconstruction of the indicator going \\nfrom achievement to shortfall and vice \\nversa. third, in practical terms, they \\navoid extreme sensitivity from variable \\nbases of comparison.19 world bank 2018a.\\n20 the convergence in primary education \\nis based on between-country and \\nwithin-country comparisons over the \\nlast decade. unesco (2019b) presents \\nsimilar results over that period but \\nhighlights that over the last few \\nyears there have been no evidence of \\nconvergence between countries.21 deaton 2013a.22 this analysis is based on simple aver-ages. in statistical table˜1 the analysis \\nis based on population-weighted \\naverages and reveals a gap of 18.2 \\nyears.23 undesa 2019.24 undesa 2019.25 un 2015a.26 permanyer and smits 2019.27 consistent results with this divergence \\nin life expectancy at older ages are \\ndocumented by engelman, canudas-romo and agree (2010) and permanyer \\nand scholl (2019). seligman, \\ngreenberg and tuljapurkar (2016) also \\n˚nd a disassociation between equity \\nand length of lifespan.28 based on data from undesa (2019), \\nthe absolute gain in life expectancy at \\nage 70 was higher in very high human \\ndevelopment countries than in low \\nhuman development countries during \\nthe second half of the 20th century. \\nbetween 1955 and 1995 the gain was \\n63˛percent higher in very high human \\ndevelopment countries than in low \\nhuman development countries. in the \\n21st century there has been marked \\nincrease: between 1995 and 2015 the \\nincrease was 223˛percent higher in \\nvery high human development coun-tries than in low human development. \\nthe contrast is even starker in relative \\nterms.29 the discussion is limited to people \\nunder age 80 because people rarely \\nsurvive beyond age 100.30 bragg and others 2017; di cesare and \\nothers 2013; gonzaga and

expec-tancy gaps across different income \\ngroups because they ignore income \\nmobility. kreiner, nielsen and serena \\n(2018) argue that overestimation could \\nbe as high as 50˛percent. using data \\nfor denmark, they also ˚nd that gaps \\nacross socioeconomic groups have \\nbeen increasing over time and that \\nthe overestimation is attenuated at \\nhigher ages (disappearing completely \\nat age 80). mackenbach and others \\n(2018) note that health inequalities \\ngenerally increased in europe between \\nthe 1980s and the late 2000s, with \\nsome narrowing in several countries \\nsince then.33 chetty and others 2016. also, \\nfinkelstein, gentzkow and williams \\n(2019) estimate that moving from a \\n10th percentile location to a 90th \\npercentile location increases life \\nexpectancy at age 65 by 1.1 years in \\nthe united states.34 baker, currie and schwandt 2017.\\n35 brønnum-hansen 2017; kreiner, \\nnielsen and serena 2018.36 van raalte, sasson and martikainen

gender \\ngroups in 23 organisation for economic \\nco-operation and development coun-tries. their estimates of expected lon-gevity at ages 25 and 65 by education \\nand gender show that the gap in life \\nexpectancy between highly educated \\nand poorly educated people is 8 years \\nfor men and 5 years for women at age \\n25 and 3.5 years for men and 2.5 years \\nfor women at age 65. this implies \\nthat relative inequalities in longevity \\nby education increase with age. for \\nfrance, currie, schwandt and thuilliez \\n(2018) found no signi˚cant changes \\nover time and little

2013, p.˛98.11 brunori, ferreira and peragine 2013. \\nthis conclusion was drawn from two \\ndifferent measures of mobility: inter-generational persistence in income \\nand intergenerational persistence in \\neducation.12 for an earlier analysis on inequality of \\nopportunity, see world bank (2006). \\nthe report found that a quarter of \\nall differences in earnings between \\nworkers can be attributed to similar \\ncircumstances as the ones mentioned \\nabove.13 narayan and others 2018. the \\nmeasure for mobility is intergenera-tional persistence in education and the \\nmeasure for inequality of opportunity \\nis the inequality of economic oppor-tunity index developed in brunori, \\nferreira and peragine (2013).14 brunori, ferreira and peragine 2013. \\nfor a critical literature review on \\nequality and inequality of opportunity \\nfocusing on the principles of compen-sation and reward, see ferreira and \\nperagine (2016).15 even in rather equal societies there is \\nevidence that children of wealthy par-ents are well off themselves. recent \\nevidence drawn from the wealth \\nof adoptees in norway (fagereng, \\nmogstad and ronning 2019) and \\nsweden (black and others 2019) sug-gests that the wealth of the adoptive \\nparents was a strong determinant of \\nchildren™s accumulation of wealth. an \\nimportant caveat is that these ˚ndings \\npertain to the intergenerational \\ntransmission of wealth, which may be \\ndifferent from that of income, which is \\nthe focus of this section.16 roemer 1998.17 there is consensus among many \\neconomic thinkers that ˚nal welfare \\nis inappropriate for assessing distrib-utive justice. compare, for example, \\ndworkin (1981), rawls (1971), roemer \\n(1998) and sen (1985).18 narayan and others 2018.19 deaton

\\nlife (bjorkenstam and others 2017).23 this behaviour does not need to re˜ect \\nrational choices or individual pref-erences but may even be shaped by \\nthe dynamics of social structures, as \\nargued in xie, cheng and zhou (2015).24 the contribution of assortative mating \\nto levels and changes in income \\ninequality varies in the literature. \\nblundell, joyce, keiller and ziliak \\n(2018) estimate that, for the united \\nkingdom and the united states, assor-tative mating contributed slightly more \\nthan half of the increase in household \\nearnings for the group between the \\n5th and 95th percentiles in the period \\n1994œ2015 (table 2, p.˛58). greenwood \\nand others (2014) report a very large \\nimpact of assortative mating on ine-quality by simulating what would have \\nhappened to income inequality in the \\nunited states in 2005 if mating had \\nbeen random; but they later corrected \\nthese ˚ndings as an overestimation \\n(greenwood and others 2015). the \\ncorrected estimates are in line with \\nthose of eika, mogstad and zafar \\n(forthcoming) for the united states and \\nother developed countries, which show \\nthat assortative mating accounts for \\na non-negligible amount of income ine-quality, but with other factors playing \\na greater role. (hryshko, juhn and \\nmccue 2017 also ˚nd a small effect \\nfor the united states). hakak and \\nfirpo (2017) ˚nd similar evidence for \\nbrazil, showing that the counterfactual \\nincome gini with assortative mating \\nwould have been slightly slower \\nthan it actually was over a period \\nof 20 years (see also torche 2010, \\nwho ˚nds an isomorphism between \\nassortative mating and inequality not \\nonly for brazil but also for chile and \\nmexico). further, these studies show \\nthat the patterns of assortative mating \\nacross income groups and over time \\nvary, and with several other factors \\ndriving inequality, it is dif˚cult to \\nattribute unambiguously the impact of \\nassortative mating to inequality. still, \\nthe evidence strongly suggests that \\nassortative mating takes place across \\ncountries and makes a non-negligible \\ncontribution to income inequality.\\n25 for an argument and evidence showing \\nhow assortative mating is important \\nfor intergenerational mobility see \\nchadwick and solon (2002).26 most of the analysis in this section \\nconsiders what happens from one gen-eration to the next, but even though \\nthe evidence is contentious in the \\nliterature, the persistence can carry \\neven across multiple generations, with \\nthe effects dissipating over time (see \\nsolon 2018 for a recent review).27 regression of

kuznets 1955. lewis™s dual model is \\nsimilar in spirit to kuznets™s, but lewis \\nassumes that holders of capital in the \\nmodern sector can accumulate wealth \\nwhile paying a constant wage to a \\nﬁreserve armyﬂ of workers that are \\navailable in the agricultural sector, \\nthus having very different implications \\non income distribution (lewis 1954).56 kuznets 1955, p.˛17. he also con-sidered the implications of a higher \\nsavings rate, and thus accumulation \\nof capital and assets, at the top of the \\nincome distribution, emphasizing the \\nimpact of policies and taxes in limiting \\nthe accumulation of wealth at the \\nvery top. the ﬁunravellingﬂ of these \\npolicies and tax structures in many \\nmarket-based economies is document-ed by piketty (2014), who argues that \\nthe mid-20th century, when inequality \\nwas low, was an exceptional period \\nduring which institutions curbed the \\ntendency of returns to capital running \\nahead income growth and that the \\nmore normal course of capitalism is to \\nhave a high concentration of income \\nand wealth at the topšwhich is the \\ntrend that has dominated in several \\nadvanced economies since the 1980s. \\nthis would thus be a rejection of \\nkuznets-like arguments grounded on \\nstructural change.57 kanbur 2017.58 milanovic 2016. thus, the recent in-crease in inequality in many advanced \\neconomies can be interpreted as the \\ntransition to societies adjusting to \\nthe joint effects of globalization and \\ntechnological change (conceição and \\ngalbraith 2001).59 tinbergen 1974, 1975.\\nnotes

\\nto the canadian population assuming \\nthe same distribution as the one \\nobserved in the united states. the \\nsimpli˚cation seems acceptable given \\nthe similar trajectories of top income \\nshares observed in the two countries \\nand is justi˚ed by the relatively small \\nsize of canada as compared with the \\nunited states (implying that different \\nassumptions on the distribution of \\nnational income in canada only have \\na marginal impact on the distribution \\nof growth in the united states and \\ncanada combined). the two countries \\nare merged into a single aggregate. \\nthis allows a simple estimate of \\ninequality in a region that is broadly \\ncomparable in size to western europe, \\nwhile taking into consideration the \\nmain differences in national income

only \\ndirect emissions from consumption \\n(such as driving a car) but also the in-direct emissions related to production \\nof a good or service (for instance, the \\nsteel processing, manufacturing and \\ntransportation activities required to \\nmake a chair available for someone to \\nsit on).3 because fewer consumers have the \\npurchasing power to afford ﬁgreenﬂ \\ngoods and services, keeping prices \\nup and generating less demand for \\nfurther technological change (vona and \\npatriarca 2011).4 there is evidence supporting this \\nhypothesis for the case of states \\nin the united states, with analysis \\nshowing that there is no impact \\nof the gini index on emissions by \\nstate (thus, con˚rming that the ˚rst \\nmechanism is either absent or weak) \\nbut that there is a positive relationship \\nbetween state-level emissions and the \\nconcentration of income among the top \\n10˛percent, consistent with ﬁapproach-es that focus on political economy \\ndynamics [–] which highlight the \\npotential political and economic power \\n[–] of the wealthyﬂ (jorgenson, \\nschor and huang 2017, p.˛40). market \\nconcentration was key in the history \\nof the development of the montreal \\nprotocol in 1987 to combat ozone-de-stroying chloro˜uorocarbons. for years, \\ndominant ˚rms opposed regulatory \\naction until they saw how they could \\nbene˚t economically from regulation \\nthat would create a pro˚table market \\nfor chemical substitutes (hamann and \\nothers 2018; maxwell and briscoe \\n1998).5 much of the evidence applies to \\ncommon pool resources, as opposed to \\na global public good such as climate \\nstability, but the broader mechanism \\nshowing how inequality makes collec-tive action more challenging remains \\nvalid. see, for instance, alesina and la \\nferrara (2000); anderson, mellor and \\nmilyo (2008); bardhan (2000); costa \\nand kahn (2003); and varughese and \\nostrom (2001).6 for both the impact of inequality in \\nreducing cooperation and the value \\nof communication in enabling it, see \\ntavoni and others (2011).\\n7 berger and others 2011.8 and how inequality exacerbates \\nsocial status competition and could \\nencourage growth policies at the ex-pense of environmental ones (baland, \\nbardhan and bowles 2007; berthe \\nand elie 2015; chaigneau and brown \\n2016; franzen and vogl 2013; magnani \\n2000).9 cohen and others 2018 p.˛1.10 some evidence suggests that decoup-ling is associated with reductions in \\nincome inequalityšmore speci˚cally, \\nthat it is negatively associated with \\nincreasing the income share of the top \\n20˛percent and positively associated \\nwith increasing the income share of \\nthe bottom 20˛percent (mcgee and \\ngreiner 2018).11 cumming and von cramon-taubadel \\n2018.12 see moser and kleinhückelkotten \\n(2017) for an exploration of the \\ncomplexities of environmental identity, \\nintentions and impacts, combining in-tent- and impact-oriented perspectives \\nthat have been motivating questions \\nin the environmental psychology \\nliterature.13 for instance, the trend (that is, \\nremoving cyclical changes in income) \\nelasticity between income and emis-sions for a typical developed country \\nhas been estimated to be essentially \\nzero for production-based emissions \\n(effectively meaning that emissions \\nare decoupled from growth), while \\njumping to 0.5 for consumption-based \\nemissions (implying still quite strong \\ncoupling); the elasticities estimated for \\ndeveloping countries are about 0.7 for \\nboth production-based emissions and \\nconsumption-based emissions (cohen \\nand others 2018).14 a related conceptšand narrower one, \\nin certain formulationsšdiscussed at \\nlength in the literature is the pollution \\nhaven hypothesis, ˚rst postulated \\nby copeland and taylor (1994) in the \\ncontext of the north american free \\ntrade agreement. in its most general \\nformulation, the pollution haven hy-pothesis posits that trade liberalization \\nencourages more polluting ˚rms and \\nindustries to move some of their oper-ations to countries with laxer environ-mental standards, thereby increasing \\npollution in receiving countries. \\nevidence for the hypothesis is mixed; \\nsee gill, viswanathan and abdul karim \\n(2018) for a comprehensive review. a \\nconceptual sticking point is causal-ityšthat is, whether ˚rms relocate \\nbecause of the laxer environmental \\nstandards or for some other reason \\nthat also happens to correlate with \\nweaker standards. some compelling \\nevidence exists for the hypothesis for \\ncarbon dioxide emissions, including \\nrecently in itzhak, kleimeier and viehs \\n(2018), which used innovative micro \\ndata. environmental burden shifting \\nas presented in this chapter is broader \\nthan under the pollution haven hypoth-esis and is not preconditioned on dif-ferences in environmental regulation. \\nit can occur between countriesšin the \\nform of net ˜ows of virtual pollution or \\nresource use (such as freshwater use) \\nbundled in traded goodsšor within \\nthemšfor example, in the siting of \\nwaste disposal facilities. kolcava, \\nnguyen and bernauer (2019) show only \\npartial support for a link between trade \\nliberalization via preferential trade \\nagreements and environmental burden \\nshifting, as measured by aggregate \\necological footprints. still, that study \\nhas tested a narrower hypothesis \\n(trade liberalization via preferential \\ntrade agreements) than what this \\nchapter asserts has to do with trade \\ngenerally, regardless of the extent of \\nliberalization, as well as to do with \\nnon-trade-related burden shifting. see \\nalso roca (2003).15 given that the negative effects of cli-mate change fall disproportionally on \\nthose with lower incomes and fewer \\ncapabilities (undp 2007).16 based on simulations of the evolution \\nin income inequality across countries \\nfrom 1961 to 2010, measured by the \\n90:10 ratio of population-weighted \\ngdp per capita (diffenbaugh and \\nburke 2019a). these results have \\nbeen contested as an overestimation \\n(rosen 2019), but the authors stand by \\ntheir ˚ndings (diffenbaugh and burke \\n2019b).17 burke and tanutama 2019; randell and \\ngray 2019. although a lot depends on how impact is assessed (for example, economic damages or causalities) and on the nature of hazards linked to climate change. for instance, there is evidence that extreme temperature events have increased mortality in both developed and developing countries, deaths linked to extreme drought have gone down in both groups of countries and there is increasing polarization between developed and developing countries in deaths associated with ex-treme storms increasing in developing countries (coronese and others 2019).18 pershing and others (2019) provide a \\nconceptual overview of the impact of \\nclimate change on ﬁsurpriseﬂ events

\\nde bettignies 2002.23 ritchie and roser 2018.24 some have argued that the uncon-ditional pledges under the paris \\nagreement worsen existing inequal-ities in carbon emissions and that an \\nemissions trading scheme across a \\nsubset of major signatories shows \\nthat although emissions trading re-duces the costs of meeting emissions \\nreductions targets, most of the gains \\nwould go to richer countries, implying \\nadditional inequality. see rose, wei \\nand bento (2019).25 chancel and piketty 2015.26 cardona and others 2012.27 even though growth in the economic \\ndamages associated with extreme \\nhazards in temperate regions has ac-celerated (coronese and others 2019).28 the only stronger hurricane ever \\nrecorded in the atlantic was hurricane \\nallen in 1980, but

\\ndivergence, even though the book \\npresented what was at the time an \\noriginal thesis on how and why the \\nindustrial revolution happened (claim-ing that it was happenstance that it \\noriginated in europe, given that east \\nasia had very similar conditions in \\nthe late 17th century and, further, that \\neurope™s advantage was due largely to \\nthe large natural resources extracted \\nfrom the ﬁnew worldﬂ colonies). \\nthis view is contested, with a recent \\nreview of the debate on the causes \\nof the great divergence and multiple \\nhypothesis being put forward, included \\nin vries (2016). for a recent economic \\nperspective, see o™rourke, rahman \\nand taylor (2019).\\n2 the aspiration to ﬁdevelopﬂ in \\nmuch of the second half of the 20th \\ncentury was almost synonymous with \\nﬁindustrialization.ﬂ and, indeed, over \\nthe second half of the 20th century, \\nmanufacturing moved to several de-veloped countriesšthough not to all \\nand not at the same timešleading to \\nsome convergence in incomes across \\ncountries. a testimony of the enduring \\nappeal of industrialization is re˜ected \\nin the fact that industrializing remains \\none of the goals of the 2030 agenda \\nfor sustainable development.3 until the mid-19th century the \\nlargest ratio of real income per capita \\nbetween the richest and the poorest \\nsociety was 5 to 1 (vries 2016). human \\ndevelopment report of˚ce calcula-tions based on country estimates in \\nthe maddison project database of in-come per person (bolt and others 2018) \\nshow that the ratio had grown to 50 \\nto 1 by the middle of the 20th century. \\nthese estimates are contested but still \\nprovide a useful reference point. on \\ninequality within countries, milanovic, \\nlindert and williamson (2010) show \\nthat the gini coef˚cient for income \\nwas, on average, as high in preindus-trial as in industrial economies, with \\nsimilar variation across economies.4 the intensive use of coal as a source \\nof energy continued throughout the \\n20th century and was exacerbated by \\nthe widespread use of the internal \\ncombustion engine. for a historical ac-count of the environmental dimensions \\nof these technological innovations and \\ntheir signi˚cance, see mcneill (2001).5 the report also considered the \\nimportance of balancing incentives for \\ninvestments in new technology with \\nits diffusion and discussed the many \\nbarriers that developing countries face \\nin bene˚ting from that diffusion (undp \\n2001).6 silver and others 2018.7 lecun, bengio and

\\nthis can be done much faster than the \\nsharing of information by humans, who \\ncommunicate at rates of 10 bits per \\nsecond, 100˛million times slower than \\nmachines (pratt 2015).8 and beyond the impact on labour \\nmarkets, arti˚cial intelligence is also \\nstarting to raise very deep philosoph-ical questions. as of now, and in the \\nnear future, arti˚cial intelligence sim-ply implements

table 2, which presents trends \\nusing consistent data, or http://hdr.undp.org/en/data, which \\npresents interpolated consistent data.\\ndiscrepancies between national and \\ninternational estimates\\nnational and international data can di˝er because international \\nagencies harmonize national data using a consistent methodol\\n-ogy and occasionally produce estimates of missing data to allow \\ncomparability across countries. in other cases international \\nagencies might not have access to the most recent national data. \\nwhen hdro becomes aware of discrepancies, it brings them \\nto the attention of national and international data authorities.\\ncountry groupings and aggregates\\n˜e tables present weighted aggregates for several country \\ngroupings. in general, an

lee (korea university) was another invaluable \\nsource for the calculation of the report™s indices.\\nstatistical tables\\n˜e ˚rst six tables relate to the ˚ve composite human devel\\n-opment indices and their components. since the 2010 human \\ndevelopment report, four composite human development \\nindicesšthe hdi, the ihdi, the gii and the mpi for devel\\n-oping countriesšhave been calculated. ˜e 2014 report intro\\n-duced the gdi, which compares the hdi calculated separately \\nfor women and men. \\n˜e remaining tables present a broader set of human develop\\n-ment indicators and provide a more comprehensive picture of a \\ncountry™s human development.\\nfor indicators that are global sustainable development goals \\nindicators or can be used in monitoring progress towards specif\\n-ic goals, the table headers include the relevant goals and targets.\\ntable 1, human development index and its components,\\n ranks countries by 2018 hdi value and details the values of \\nthe three hdi components: longevity, education (with two \\nindicators) and income per capita. ˜e table also presents the \\ndi˝erence in rankings by hdi value and gross national income \\nper capita, as well as the rank on the 2017 hdi, calculated \\nusing the most recently revised historical data available in 2019.\\ntable 2, human development index trends, 1990œ2018, \\nprovides a time series of hdi values allowing 2018 hdi values \\nto be compared with those for previous years. ˜e table uses the \\nmost recently revised historical data available in 2019 and the \\nsame methodology applied to compute 2018 hdi values. ˜e \\ntable also includes the change in hdi rank over the last ˚ve \\nyears and the average annual hdi growth rate across four time \\nintervals: 1990œ2000, 2000œ2010, 2010œ2018 and 1990œ2018\\ntable 3, inequality-adjusted human development index,\\n contains two related measures of inequalityšthe ihdi and \\nthe loss in hdi due to inequality. ˜e ihdi looks beyond the \\n296\\n    |    human development report \\n2019\\naverage achievements of a country in longevity, education and \\nincome to show how these achievements are distributed among \\nits residents. ˜e ihdi value can be interpreted as the level of \\nhuman development when inequality is accounted for. ˜e rel\\n-ative di˝erence between ihdi and hdi values is the loss due \\nto inequality in distribution of the hdi within the country. \\n˜e table presents the coe˛cient of human inequality, which is \\nthe unweighted average of inequalities in the three dimensions. \\nin addition, the table shows each country™s di˝erence in rank \\non the hdi and the ihdi. a negative value means that taking \\ninequality into account lowers a country™s rank on the hdi. \\n˜e table also presents the income shares of the poorest 40 \\npercent, the richest 10 percent and the richest 1 percent of the \\npopulation, as well as the gini coe˛cient.\\ntable 4, gender development index, \\nmeasures dispar\\n-ities on the hdi by gender. ˜e table contains hdi values \\nestimated separately for women and men; the ratio of which is \\nthe gdi value. ˜e closer the ratio\\n˜is to 1,\\n the smaller the gap \\nbetween women and men. values for the three hdi compo\\n-nentsšlongevity, education (with two indicators) and income \\nper capitašare also presented by gender. ˜e table includes ˚ve \\ncountry groupings by absolute deviation from gender parity in \\nhdi values.\\ntable 5, gender inequality index, \\npresents a composite \\nmeasure of gender inequality using three dimensions: repro\\n-ductive health, empowerment and the labour market. ˜e \\nreproductive health indicators are the maternal mortality ratio \\nand the adolescent birth rate. ˜e empowerment indicators are \\nthe share of parliamentary seats held by women and the share \\nof population with at least some secondary education by gender. \\n˜e labour market indicator is participation in the labour force \\nby gender. a low gii value indicates low inequality between \\nwomen and men, and vice-versa.\\ntable 6, multidimensional poverty index, \\ncaptures the \\nmultiple deprivations that people in developing countries face in \\ntheir health, education and standard of living. ˜e mpi shows \\nboth the incidence of nonincome multidimensional poverty (a \\nheadcount of those in multidimensional poverty) and its inten\\n-sity (the average deprivation score experienced by poor people). \\nbased on deprivation score thresholds, people are classi˚ed as \\nvulnerable to multidimensional poverty, multidimensionally \\npoor or in severe multidimensional poverty. ˜e table includes \\nthe contribution of deprivation in each dimension to overall \\nmultidimensional poverty. it also presents measures of income \\npovertyšpopulation living below the national poverty line and \\npopulation living on less than $1.90 in purchasing power parity \\nterms per day. mpi values are based on a revised methodology \\ndeveloped in partnership with ophi. for details, see \\ntechnical \\nnote 5\\n at http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/˚les/hdr2019_tech\\n-nical_notes.pdf and ophi™s website (http://ophi.org.uk/\\nmultidimensional-poverty-index/).\\ntable 7, population trends, \\ncontains major population \\nindicators, including total population, median age, dependency \\nratios and total fertility rates, which can help assess the burden \\nof support that falls on the labour force in a country.\\ntable 8, health outcomes, \\npresents indicators of infant \\nhealth (percentage of infants who are exclusively breastfed in \\nthe 24 hours prior to the survey, percentage of infants who lack \\nimmunization for dpt and measles and infant mortality rate) \\nand of child health (percentage of children under age 5 who are \\nstunted and under-˚ve mortality rates). ˜e table also contains \\nindicators of adult health (adult mortality rates by gender, \\nmortality rates due to noncommunicable diseases by gender \\nincidence of malaria and tuberculosis and hiv prevalence \\nrates). finally, it includes healthy life expectancy at birth and \\ncurrent health expenditure as a percentage of gdp.\\ntable 9, education achievements, \\npresents standard edu\\n-cation indicators. ˜e table provides indicators of educational \\nattainmentšadult and youth literacy rates and the share of the \\nadult population with at least some secondary education. gross \\nenrolment ratios at each level of education are complemented by \\nprimary school dropout rate and survival rate to the last grade \\nof lower secondary general education. ˜e table also presents \\ngovernment expenditure on education as a percentage of gdp.\\ntable 10, national income and composition of resources, \\ncovers several macroeconomic indicators such as gross domestic \\nproduct (gdp), labour share of gdp (which includes wages \\nand social protection transfers), gross ˚xed capital formation, \\nand taxes on income, pro˚t and capital gains as a percentage of \\ntotal tax revenue. gross ˚xed capital formation is a rough indi\\n-cator of national income that is invested rather than consumed. \\nin times of economic uncertainty or recession, gross ˚xed \\ncapital formation typically declines. general government ˚nal \\nconsumption expenditure (presented as a share of gdp and as \\naverage annual growth) is an indicator of public spending. in \\naddition, the table presents two indicators of debtšdomestic \\ncredit provided by the ˚nancial sector and total debt service, \\nboth measured as a percentage of gdp or gni. ˜e consumer \\nprice index, a measure of in˙ation, is also presented.\\ntable 11, work and employment,\\n contains indicators on \\nfour topics: employment, unemployment, work that is a risk to \\nhuman development and employment-related social security. \\n˜e employment indicators are the employment to popula\\n-tion ratio, the labour force participation rate, employment in \\nagriculture and employment in services. ˜e unemployment \\nindicators are total unemployment, youth unemployment and \\nyouth not in school or employment. ˜e indicators on work \\nthat is a risk to human development are child labour, the \\nworking poor and the proportion of informal employment in \\nnonagricultural employment. a new indicator on skill-level \\nemploymentšhigh-skill to low-skill employment ratiošhas \\nbeen added. ˜e indicator on employment-related social secu\\n-rity is the percentage of the eligible population that receives an \\nold-age pension.\\n table 12, human security,\\n re˙ects the extent to which the \\npopulation is secure. ˜e table begins with the percentage of births \\nreaders guide    |    297\\nthat are registered, followed by the number of refugees by country \\nof origin and the number of internally displaced people. it then \\nshows the size of the homeless population due to natural disasters, \\nthe number of deaths and missing people attributed to disasters, \\nthe population of orphaned children and the prison population. it \\nalso provides homicide and suicide rates (by gender), an indicator \\non justi˚cation of wife beating and an indicator on the depth of \\nfood de˚cit (average dietary energy supply adequacy).\\ntable 13, human and capital mobility,\\n provides indica\\n-tors of several aspects of globalization. international trade is \\ncaptured by measuring exports and imports as a share of gdp. \\nfinancial ˙ows are represented by net in˙ows of foreign direct \\ninvestment and ˙ows of private capital, net o˛cial develop\\n-ment assistance and in˙ows of remittances. human mobility \\nis captured by the net migration rate, the stock of immigrants, \\nthe net number of tertiary students from abroad (expressed as \\na percentage of total tertiary enrolment in the country) and \\nthe number of international inbound tourists. international \\ncommunication is represented by the percentages of the total \\nand female populations that use the internet, the number of \\nmobile phone subscriptions per 100 people and the percentage \\nchange in mobile phone subscriptions between 2010 and 2017.\\ntable 14, supplementary indicators: perceptions of well-be\\n-ing, \\nincludes indicators that re˙ect individuals™ perceptions of \\nrelevant dimensions of human developmentšeducation quality, \\nhealth care quality, standard of living, personal safety, freedom of \\nchoice and overall life satisfaction. ˜e table also presents indi\\n-cators re˙ecting perceptions about community and government.\\ntable 15, status of fundamental human rights treaties, \\nshows when countries rati˚ed key human rights conventions. \\n˜e 11 selected conventions cover basic human rights and free\\n-doms related to elimination of all forms of racial and gender \\ndiscrimination and violence, protection of children™s rights, \\nrights of migrant workers and persons with disabilities. ˜ey \\nalso cover torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading \\ntreatment as well as protection from enforced disappearance.\\ndashboard 1, ˚uality of human development, \\ncontains a \\nselection of indicators associated with the quality of health, edu\\n-cation and standard of living. ˜e indicators on quality of health \\nare lost health expectancy, number of physicians and number \\nof hospital beds. ˜e indicators on quality of education are \\npupilœteacher ratio in primary schools; primary school teachers \\ntrained to teach; proportion of primary and secondary schools \\nwith access to the internet; and programme for international \\nstudent assessment (pisa) scores in mathematics, reading and \\nscience. ˜e indicators on quality of standard of living are the \\nproportion of employment that is in vulnerable employment, \\nthe proportion of rural population with access to electricity, \\nthe proportion of population using at least basic drinking-water \\nservices and the proportion of population using at least basic \\nsanitation facilities. a country in the top third of an indicator \\ndistribution has performed better than at least two-thirds of \\ncountries globally. a country that is in the top third group on all \\nindicators can be considered a country with the highest quality \\nof human development. ˜e dashboard shows that not all coun\\n-tries in the very high human development group have the high\\n-est quality of human development across all quality indicators \\nand that many countries in the low human development group \\nare in the bottom third of all quality indicators in the table.\\ndashboard 2, life-course gender gap, \\ncontains a selection of \\nindicators that indicate gender gaps in choices and opportunities \\nover the life coursešchildhood and youth, adulthood and older \\nage. ˜e indicators refer to health, education, labour market and \\nwork, seats in parliament, time use and social protection. most \\nindicators are presented as a ratio of female to male values. sex \\nratio at birth is an exception to grouping by tercilešcountries \\nare divided into two groups: the natural group (countries with \\na value of 1.04œ1.07, inclusive) and the gender-biased group (all \\nother countries). deviations from the natural sex ratio at birth \\nhave implications for population replacement levels; they can \\nsuggest possible future social and economic problems and may \\nindicate gender bias. countries with values of a parity index con\\n-centrated around 1 form the group with the best achievements \\nin that indicator. deviations from parity are treated equally \\nregardless of which gender is overachieving.\\ndashboard 3, women™s empowerment, \\ncontains a selec\\n-tion of woman-speci˚c empowerment indicators that allows \\nempowerment to be compared across three dimensions: repro\\n-ductive health and family planning, violence against girls and \\nwomen and socioeconomic empowerment. most countries have \\nat least one indicator in each tercile, which implies that wom\\n-en™s empowerment is unequal across indicators and countries.\\ndashboard 4, environmental sustainability, \\ncontains a \\nselection of indicators that\\n cover environmental sustainability \\nand environmental threats. ˜e environmental sustainability \\nindicators present levels of or changes in energy consumption, \\ncarbon dioxide emissions, forest area, fresh water withdrawals \\nand natural resource depletion. ˜e environmental threats \\nindicators are mortality rates attributed to household and \\nambient air pollution and to unsafe water, sanitation and \\nhygiene services, proportion of land that is degraded mostly by \\nhuman activities and practices, and the international union for \\nconservation of nature red list index value, which measures \\naggregate extinction risk across groups of species.\\ndashboard 5, socioeconomic sustainability,\\n contains a \\nselection of indicators that cover economic and social sustain\\n-ability. ˜e economic sustainability indicators are adjusted \\nnet savings, total debt service, gross capital formation, skilled \\nlabour force, diversity of exports and expenditure on research \\nand development. ˜e social sustainability indicators are the \\nold age dependency ratio projected to 2030, the ratio of edu\\n-cation and health expenditure to military expenditure, change \\nin overall loss in hdi value due to inequality and changes in \\ngender and income inequality.\\n298\\n    |    human development report \\n2019\\nhuman development \\ncomposite indices\\nsdg 3sdg 4.3sdg 4.6sdg 8.5human development index (hdi)life expectancy at birthexpected years

intensity of the deprivations. see technical note 5 \\nat http://hdr.undp.org/sites/\\ndefault/˜les/hdr2019_technical_notes.pdf for details on how the multidimensional poverty index is calculated.multidimensional poverty headcount: population with a deprivation score of at least 33 percent. it is expressed as a share of the population in the survey year, the number of people in the survey \\nyear and the projected number of people in 2017.intensity of deprivation of multidimensional poverty: average \\ndeprivation score experienced by people in multidimensional poverty.\\ninequality among the poor: variance of individual deprivation \\nscores of poor people. it is calculated by subtracting the deprivation score of each multidimensionally poor person from the average intensity, squaring the differences and dividing the sum of the \\nweighted squares by the number of multidimensionally poor people.population in severe multidimensional poverty: percentage of the population in severe multidimensional povertyšthat is, those with a deprivation score of 50 percent or more.population vulnerable to multidimensional poverty: percentage of the population at risk of suffering multiple deprivationsšthat is, those with a deprivation score of 20œ33 percent.contribution of deprivation in dimension to overall multidimensional poverty: percentage of the multidimensional poverty index attributed to deprivations in each dimension. population living below national poverty line: percentage of the population living below the national poverty line, which is the poverty line deemed appropriate for a country by its authorities. national estimates are based on population-weighted subgroup estimates from household surveys.population living below ppp $1.90 a day: percentage of the population living below the international poverty line of $1.90 (in purchasing power parity [ppp] terms) a day.\\nmain data sources\\ncolumn 1: refers to the year and the

three groups of approximately equal size (terciles): the top third, the middle third and the bottom third. aggregates are colour coded using the same tercile cutoffs. see technical note 6\\n at http://hdr.undp.org/\\nsites/default/˚les/hdr2019_technical_notes.pdf for details about partial grouping in this table.a this column is intentionally left without colour because it is meant to provide context for the indicator on change in forest area.b data refer to the most recent year available during the period speci˚ed.c less than 0.1.definitionsfossil fuel energy consumption: percentage of total energy consumption that comes from fossil fuels, which consist of coal, oil, petroleum and natural gas products.renewable energy consumption: share of renewable energy in total ˚nal energy consumption. renewable sources include hydroelectric, geothermal, solar, tides, wind, biomass and biofuels.\\ncarbon dioxide emissions: human-originated carbon dioxide emissions stemming from the burning of fossil fuels, gas ˛aring and the production of cement. carbon dioxide emitted by forest biomass through depletion of forest areas is included. data are expressed in tonnes per capita (based on midyear population) and in kilograms per unit of gross domestic product (gdp) in constant 2010 us dollars.forest area: land spanning more than 0.5 hectare with trees taller than 5 metres and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. it excludes land predominantly under agricultural or urban land use, tree stands in agricultural production systems (for example, in fruit plantations and agroforestry systems) and trees in urban parks and gardens. areas under reforestation that have not yet reached but are expected to reach a canopy cover of 10 percent and a tree height of 5 metres are included, as are temporarily unstocked areas resulting from human intervention or natural causes that are expected to regenerate.fresh water withdrawals: total fresh water \\nwithdrawn, expressed as a percentage of total renewable water resources.natural resource depletion: monetary valuation of energy, mineral and forest depletion, expressed as \\na percentage of gross national income (gni).mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution: deaths resulting from exposure to ambient (outdoor) air pollution and household (indoor) air pollution from solid fuel use for cooking, expressed per 100,000 population. ambient air pollution results from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks.\\nmortality rate attributed to unsafe water, \\nsanitation and hygiene services: deaths attributable to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene \\nfocusing on inadequate wash services, expressed per 100,000 population.degraded land: rain-fed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest and woodlands that have experienced the reduction or loss of biological or economic productivity and complexity resulting from a combination of pressures, including land use and management practices.red list index: measure of the aggregate extinction risk across groups of species. it is based on genuine changes in the number of species in each category of extinction risk on the international union for conservation of nature red list of threatened species. it ranges from 0, all species categorized as extinct, to 1, all species categorized as least concern.main data sources\\ncolumns 1, 2, 5 and 8: world bank (2019a).\\ncolumns 3, 4, 11 and 12: united nations statistics division

people have little prospect for a \\nbetter future. they are without hope, purpose or dignity, \\nwatching from society™s sidelines as they see others pulling \\nahead to ever greater prosperity. worldwide many have \\nescaped extreme poverty. but even more have neither the \\nopportunities nor the resources to control their lives. far \\ntoo often a person™s place in society is still determined by \\nethnicity, gender or his or her parents™ wealth.\\ninequalities. the evidence is everywhere. inequalities do \\nnot always re˜ect an unfair world, but when they have little \\nto do with rewarding effort, talent or entrepreneurial risk-\\ntaking, they can be an affront to human dignity. under the \\nshadow of sweeping technological change and the climate \\ncrisis, such inequalities in human development hurt societies, \\nweakening social cohesion and people™s trust in government, \\ninstitutions and each other. most hurt economies, wastefully \\npreventing people from reaching their full potential at work \\nand in life. they often make it harder for political decisions to \\nre˜ect the aspirations of the whole of society and to protect \\nthe planet, if the few pulling ahead ˜ex their power to shape \\ndecisions in their interests. in the extreme, people can take \\nto the streets. \\nthese inequalities in human development are a roadblock \\nto achieving the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. \\nthey are not just about disparities in income and wealth. \\nthey cannot be accounted for simply by using summary \\nmeasures of inequality that focus on a single dimension. and \\nthey will shape the prospects of people that may live to see \\nthe 22nd century. this report explores inequalities in human \\ndevelopment by going beyond income, beyond averages and \\nbeyond today. it asks what forms of inequality matter and \\nwhat drives them, recognizing that pernicious inequalities \\nare generally better thought of as a symptom of broader \\nproblems in a society and economy. it also asks what policies \\ncan tackle those driversšpolicies that can simultaneously \\nhelp nations to grow their economies, improve human \\ndevelopment and reduce inequality.\\nit is hard to get a clear picture of inequalities in human \\ndevelopment and how they are changing. in part because \\nthey are as broad and multifaceted as life itself. in part \\nbecause the measures we rely on, and the data that underpin \\nthem, are often inadequate. yet important patterns repeat \\nagain and again.\\nin every country the goalposts are moving. inequality \\nin human development is high or increasing in the areas \\nexpected to become more important in the future. there has \\nbeen some progress worldwide in fundamental areas, such \\nas escaping from poverty and receiving a basic education, \\nthough important gaps remain. yet at the same time, \\ninequalities are widening higher up the ladder of progress.\\na human development approach opens new windows \\non inequalitiesšwhy they matter, how they manifest \\nthemselves and what to do about themšthat help create \\nconcrete action. the report suggests the importance of \\nrealigning existing policy goals: emphasizing, for instance, \\nthe quality education at all agesšincluding at the preprimary \\nlevelšin addition to focusing on primary and secondary \\nenrolment rates. many of these aspirations are already \\nre˜ected in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. it \\nalso means addressing power imbalances that are at the heart \\nof many inequalities, such as leveling the economic playing \\n˚eld through antitrust measures. in some cases, addressing \\ninequalities means tackling social norms embedded deep \\nwith a nation™s history and culture. many policies comprise \\noptions that would enhance both equity and ef˚ciency. the \\nmain reason why they often are not pursued may be linked \\nwith the power of entrenched interests who do not stand to \\ngain from change.\\nthe future of inequalities in human development in the 21st \\ncentury is in our hands. but we cannot be complacent. the \\nclimate crisis shows that the price of inaction compounds \\nover time, as it feeds further inequality, which can in turn \\nmake action on climate more dif˚cult. technology is already \\nchanging labour markets and lives, but not yet locked-in \\nis the extent to which machines may replace people. we \\nare, however, approaching a precipice beyond which it will \\nbe dif˚cult to recover. we do have a choice, and we must \\nexercise it now.\\nisbn: 978-92-1-126439-5evaluation and \\nindependence\\nexisting evaluation\\n policies and  new approaches\\nevaluation and independence: \\n existing evaluation policies and

and governance arrangements. building on an external review in 2014 and \\nfollowing the revision of norms and standards for evaluation in june 2016 by the united \\nnations evaluation group (uneg) heads, in september 2016 the executive board of \\nundp agreed on a new evaluation policy to reinforce the role of evaluation at undp and \\nthe independent evaluation o˝ce (ieo)™s mandate. with the executive board as custodian \\nof the policy, the undp administrator continues to safeguard the integrity of the evaluation \\nfunction. ˚e director of undp™s ieo submits reports directly to the executive board \\nand has a ˛xed-term appointment. in support of the governance of evaluation, undp has \\nexpanded the remit of its oversight advisory committee from exclusive focus on audit to now \\nalso include evaluation function (as well as ethics).  together, these institutional and policy \\nchanges are the foundations of the undp evaluation function™s independence and ability to \\nbetter support learning and accountability.\\n˚is paper was commissioned by ieo as an input to process of revising the undp \\nevaluation policy. its authors, professor fritz sager and lyn pleger of the center for public \\nmanagement, university of bern. for their work on evaluation and independence they were \\nrecipients of the swiss evaluation society™s annual congress ‚prix seval™ in

discussions with di˜erent \\nmembers from the independent evaluation o˝ce (ieo) of the united nations development \\nprogramme (undp), and presents ˛ndings derived from a document review of di˜erent \\nun evaluation policies (annex 1). ˚is report consists of six sections and is structured as \\nfollows: after the introduction, the key ˛ndings regarding dimensions of evaluations derived \\nfrom several interviews with ieo and undp members in march 2016 are summarized in \\nsection 2. section 3 presents a theoretical de˛nition of independence and an explanation of \\ntwo di˜erent types of independence (3.1). moreover, a heuristic model of in˙uence (busd-\\nmodel) is going to be discussed (3.2). based on the ˛ndings of the interview and the \\ndocument review, the present report concludes with section 4. in here, a code of conduct for \\nupholding independence in evaluations is provided, consisting of nine \\n red ˙ags, which are also explained in this section. \\n62.  \\n key findings: review on \\ndimensions of \\nindependence \\nfrom ieo and undp \\nemployees\\n˚e interviews and document reviews have shown that ieo has made a great e˜ort over the \\nlast years to establish and increase the accountability of evaluations within the organization. \\n˚e process towards an increase of the relevance of independence is still ongoing and not \\ncompleted yet. during interviews with sta˜ of the ieo, executive board members and \\nformer ieo sta˜, it became evident that di˜erent perspectives, views and understanding of \\nthe term independence exist. similarly, di˜erent issues are regarded as being important in \\nthis context. ˚ese ˛ndings demonstrate the necessity for a uniform understanding of the \\nterm independence. a common understanding and clear de˛nition might help to e˝ciently \\nenhance speci˛c aspects of the term independence which are not as clearly established as \\nothers. interviews and discussions revealed that two di˜erent notions on independence of \\nevaluation exist which require a precise semantic distinction. we propose a \\nde˜nition of \\nindependence consisting of a distinction between formal independence and substantial \\nindependence which is clari˛ed in section 3. \\nkey ˜ndings\\n˜   shift towards accountability evaluations in the last three years, ongoing process\\n˜  requirement for a uniform

\\nassigned to two dimensions that should be distinguished: \\n˚˛˛ł   formal independence \\n    ł   substantial independence\\n73.  \\n core concepts and \\n principles on independence \\n3.1    de˜nition of independence in evaluations\\nbased on the interviews and discussions conducted, as well as de˛nitions in di˜erent un \\nevaluation policies, independence is used in di˜erent contexts. for instance, independence \\nis understood as the absence of  ﬁnot managed and/or conducted by the activity managerﬂ as \\nper the escwa evaluation policy july 2014. some evaluation policies use several synonyms \\nfor independence such as ﬁimpartialityﬂ or ﬁtransparencyﬂ, as presented in the 2006 iom \\nevaluation guidelines of the o˝ce of the inspector general. ˚e evaluation policy of undp \\nincludes a section covering ﬁnormsﬂ in which ﬁindependenceﬂ is discussed as follows:\\nﬁ \\n˜e evaluation function should be structurally independent from the operational \\nmanagement and decision-making functions in the organization so that it is free from \\nundue in˚uence, more objective, and has full authority to submit reports directly to \\nappropriate levels of decision-making.ﬂ  \\n(˜e evaluation policy of undp 2011, p. 3)\\n˚e ˛rst part of the quote describing ﬁstructural independenceﬂ refers to formal \\n independence similar to the escwa evaluation policy. ˚e second part, in contrast, \\n captures a di˜erent type of independence by claiming that evaluation function should be \\n ﬁfree from undue in˙uence.ﬂ \\n˚e structural or formal independence captures organizational requirements for independent \\nevaluations while the absence of in˙uence captures independence with respect to ethical \\nchallenges. in the revised undp evaluation policy of 2016, evaluation principles also focus \\non ethical independence by ˛rst stating that ﬁevaluations must be independent and impartialﬂ \\nand then claiming that ﬁ[i]mpartiality contributes to the credibility of evaluation and the \\navoidance of bias in ˛ndings, analyses and conclusions. independence requires that those \\nbeing evaluated should not seek to in˙uence the results of an evaluation, other than to point \\nout errors of fact and to ensure that evaluations conform to their terms of reference.ﬂ  ˚e \\nuneg ethical guidelines for evaluation also cover ethical independence in the ﬁobligations \\nof evaluatorsﬂ section: \\nﬁ \\nevaluation in the united nations systems should be demonstrably free of bias. (–) \\nevaluators shall ensure that they are not unduly in˚uenced by the views or statements \\nof any party. where the evaluator or the evaluation manager comes under pressure to \\nadopt a particular position or to introduce bias into the evaluation ˛ndings, it is the \\nresponsibility of the evaluator to ensure that independence of judgement is maintained.ﬂ \\n(uneg ethical guidelines for evaluation 2008, p. 5)\\n8due to a lack of a coherent de˛nition of the independence which includes both dimensions, \\nwe propose a de˛nition which is drawn from the ˛ndings of the discussions, interviews and \\ndocument review as well as from the research area of evaluation ethics:\\nit is important to distinguish these two fundamentally di˜erent understandings of the term \\n‚in˙uence™ as they refer to completely di˜erent problems. a clear distinction is therefore \\nrequired and shown in table 1. we propose the term \\nsubstantial independence\\n to the type \\nof independence which is the purpose of the present report. in contrast, we propose the term \\nformal independence\\n for capturing the other understanding of the term independence. \\nformal independence can be understood as organizational and structural independence. \\n with regard to the ieo, formal independence refers to the requirement to be an independent \\nevaluation o˝ce even though it is a part of the undp. another important aspect is the \\nclari˛cation of responsibilities and competencies (director, board, administrator) or the \\nbudget allocation. ˚e formal independence is already well represented in the revised undp \\nevaluation policy and does not require further clari˛cation.\\nsubstantial independence is aimed to be assured by the introduction of guiding principles \\nand evaluation standards as it can become an ethical challenge if it is not given. ˚e related \\nde˜nition of evaluation independence\\nindependence is a twofold concept and refers to formal independence on the one \\nhand and substantial independence on the other. formal independence means \\nstructural freedom from control over the conduct and substantial independence \\ncan be described as the objective scienti˝c assessment of a subject free from undue \\nin˜uence meant to distort or bias the conduct or ˝ndings of an evaluation.  \\ntable 1. di˜erences between substantial independence and formal independence\\nformal independence\\nsubstantial independence\\nł describes the formal relationship \\nbetween commissioned individual and \\nthe person who hired her or him to \\nconduct the

means\\n9concepts are ‚objectivity™ and ‚impartiality™. substantial independence requires professionaliza\\n-tion and scienti˛c integrity of the evaluator and cannot be assured by organizational struc\\n-tures. substantial independence is not fully represented in the undp evaluation policy yet. \\none reason might be the confusion with formal independence. \\nwithin the undp evaluation policy of 2011, for instance, ﬁimpartialityﬂ and ﬁindependenceﬂ \\nﬁethicsﬂ are treated as separate norms (˚e evaluation policy of undp 2011, p. 3-4). ˚e \\nuneg code of conduct for evaluation in the un system (2008, p. 2) and the uneg \\nethical guidelines for evaluation (2008, p.5) also treat independence and impartiality \\nseparately. ˚e revised evaluation policy of undp of 2016, however, does include a \\nconnection between independence and impartiality and a consideration of substantial \\nindependence. ˚e postulation that ﬁ[i]ndependence requires that those being evaluated \\nshould not seek to in˙uence the results of an evaluation, other than to point out errors \\n of fact and to ensure that evaluations conform to their terms of referenceﬂ (˚e revised \\n undp evaluation policy 2016, p.3) displays a promising approach to independence in the \\ncontext of substantial challenges. \\nwhen comparing substantial and formal independence, substantial independence refers \\n to the ˛nal evaluation and its quality. it therefore serves as a goal rather than a means. \\n formal independence refers to the conditions that enable or hinder a good ˛nal evaluation. \\n it therefore serves as a means rather than a goal. absolute formal independence may support \\nbut can also be detrimental to substantial independence.\\n˚e reason why we chose the term ‚substantial independence™ is that in evaluation research, \\nindependence is often closely related to evaluation ethics and therefore describes a less \\ntangible type of independence than formal independence (see for a detailed literature \\n overview morris 2015; see also kitchener 1984; stuˆebeam 1994). in evaluation theory, the \\nresearch on ethical challenges discovered that one main challenge for evaluators consists of \\nbeing in˙uenced or pressured by a stakeholder (brown & newman 1992; morris & cohn \\n1993; pope & vetter 1992). over the last decade, evaluation research increasingly focused on \\nspeci˛c types of ethical challenges by means of empirical studies. in the context of pressure \\n on evaluators by the hiring person, the importance of independence as an essential aspect \\n for conducting evaluation arose (morris 1999, 2007; pleger et al. 2016; ˚e lse gv314 \\ngroup 2013; turner 2003). \\n3.2   independence and in˚uence: busd-heuristic model of in˚uence\\nwhen dealing with substantial independence, the main problems result from the collaboration \\nbetween individuals. as discussed above, evaluation research identi˛ed pressure on evaluators \\nor attempts to in˙uence them during their evaluation work as one of the main ethical \\nchallenges. regarding the undp, ˛ndings from the undp evaluation policy review point in \\nthe same direction. ˚e review states that ﬁ[o]ver 40% of decentralised evaluation consultants \\nreport some form of unacceptable measures by undp managers a˜ecting the independence \\nof their evaluationsﬂ (undp evaluation policy review 2014, p. iv) and ﬁ[a]bout 38% of \\nconsultants who responded to a survey (–) reported some form of unacceptable interference \\nby managementﬂ (undp evaluation policy review 2014, p. vi). ˚e interviews with the ieo \\n10sta˜ also revealed that some evaluators have also experienced attempts by a stakeholder or \\ncolleague to misrepresent ˛ndings even though that was mainly the case during national and \\nregional evaluations. \\nnevertheless, there is a ˛ne line between the in˙uence of a stakeholder to misinterpret \\n˛ndings and to in˙uence in a way which is intended to improve the evaluation quality. \\ngiven these two types of in˙uence intention means there is a positive and a negative type of \\nin˙uence. we developed a two dimensional heuristic model of in˙uence (busd-heuristic \\nmodel of in˙uence) which distinguishes four types of in˙uence. ˚e dimensions are direction \\nof in˙uence and explicitness of in˙uence. ˚e direction of in˙uence can be divided into \\nconstructive and destructive in˙uence which lead to two types of negative in˙uence (distortion \\nand restraint) and to two types of positive in˙uence (support and betterment). explicitness \\nof in˙uence, the second dimension, can be divided into explicit and implicit in˙uence \\nwhich captures the intensity of in˙uence. ˚e busd-heuristic model of in˙uence can help \\nevaluators to di˜erentiate between positive and negative in˙uence. at the same time, it is \\nintended to draw attention to the fact that in˙uence is not necessarily negative but can \\n also be positive. \\n

\\n code of conduct for \\nupholding independence \\n in evaluations\\nbased on the ˛ndings, we propose a code of conduct consisting of nine red ˙ags for upholding \\nindependence in evaluations. ˚ey aim to illustrate and communicate the importance of and \\nresolution to problems of evaluation independence.\\na consistent understanding of an independence \\n concept is essential \\n˚e ˛rst requirement for establishing a consistent and coherent understanding of \\nindependence is a clear de˛nition of this term. by doing so, guidelines and evaluation \\nprinciples can be developed which target speci˛c components of independence. a clear \\nde˛nition of independence also helps to establish a uniform understanding of the term \\n among sta˜. a uniform understanding of terms helps to discover and communicate speci˛c \\naspects of independence that might need to be promoted whilst others might be well \\ndeveloped already. \\na clear de˛nition of the term independence also prevents a confusion with di˜erent types of \\nindependence. \\n \\nindependence is a twofold concept consisting of formal \\n and substantial independence\\nwith regard to a clear de˛nition of independence, we propose a distinction between two types \\nof independence, formal independence and substantial independence. it is important to note \\nthat both types are equally important. nevertheless, the two types refer to di˜erent aspects of \\nindependent evaluations. while formal independence has the organization in its focus and \\ncaptures organizational structures, substantial independence, in contrast, concentrates on the \\nevaluator and refers to evaluation standards or guiding principles.\\nindependence is not \\nper se\\n positive \\n˚is is a crucial point which can be intensi˛ed in evaluation policies as soon as a common \\nunderstanding of the term in˙uence in the context of ethical challenges (in here called \\nsubstantial in˙uence) is established. ˚e absence of in˙uence by the management or other \\nstakeholders does not imply automatically an increase in the evaluations™ quality and \\nindependence. as the busd-model illustrates, besides the negative types of in˙uence, positive \\ntypes of in˙uence also exist. a comprehensive evaluation policy should not only aim to hinder \\nnegative in˙uence but also try to foster positive in˙uence.\\n12312independence is a requirement for both internal and \\nexternal evaluation types\\nfor instance, within ﬁpreparing and conducting evaluations eclac guidelinesﬂ, the \\nadjective independent is only used in the context of external evaluations but not internal \\nevaluations. within the escap evaluation guidelines, the following is stated: ﬁindependence: \\nonly external evaluations that are managed and conducted by organizations other than \\nescap can be considered truly independentﬂ (escap m&e system monitoring & \\nevaluation system overview and evaluation guidelines 2010, p. 39). similarly, the reverse \\nis not necessarily applicable, namely that independence is automatically guaranteed as soon \\nas an evaluation is externally conducted: ﬁall evaluations according to this policy will be \\nmanaged and/or coordinated by the escwa team responsible for evaluations and supported \\nby external consultants whose independence from the evaluation subject is evidentﬂ (escwa \\nevaluation policy july 2014 p. 3-4). analogous to the previously mentioned red ˙ags, a \\nclear distinction between formal and substantial independence is required. whilst external \\nevaluations do meet the requirements for formal independence, substantial independence is \\nnot related to whether an evaluation is conducted externally or internally.  \\nit is not only about who conducts the evaluation but \\n how\\n the evaluation is conducted\\nbuilding on the previous point, independence is relevant for internal and external evaluations \\nespecially with regard to substantial independence where the evaluator is the center of \\nattention. evaluation principles and evaluation guidelines assist an evaluator in orientation for \\npursuing substantial independent evaluations. ˚e iom evaluation guidelines, for instance, \\ndo include an annex with questions related to evaluation criteria, and include independence \\nunder ﬁunanticipated e˜ectsﬂ: ﬁare these e˜ects complementary to other results or are they \\ncompletely independent? did these unanticipated e˜ects a˜ect (positively or negatively) \\nother results?ﬂ (o˝ce of the inspector general iom evaluation guidelines, january 2006, p. \\n33). criteria, however, which allow to answer the question are missing. guiding principles \\nand evaluation policies should o˜er as precise as possible guidance to evaluators on what \\nsubstantial independence requires.\\nindependence is required at any stage of the \\n evaluation process\\n˚e requirement of independence can be applied to any stage of the evaluation process. based \\non the de˛nition of independence in the who evaluation policy, we developed a model \\nwhich links the formal stages of the evaluation process to the levels of independence (˛gure \\n2). ˚e who evaluation policy distinguishes three levels of independence: organizational, \\nfunctional, and behavioural level, which are clari˛ed as the following: \\nﬁat the organizational level, the evaluation function must be separated from those \\nresponsible for the design and implementation of the programmes and operations being \\nevaluated. at the functional level, there must be mechanisms that ensure independence \\n45613in the planning, funding, and reporting of evaluations. at the behavioural level, there \\nmust be a code of conduct that is ethics-based. ˜is code of conduct will seek to prevent or \\nappropriately manage con˚icts of interest.ﬂ \\n(who evaluation policy 2012, p. 3-4)\\naccountability and learning are not mutually exclusive \\n but can foster each other \\naccountability and learning are based on the same type of basic evaluative information. an \\nevaluee can only learn when the evaluation provides information about the quality of his or \\nher work and board can only judge the suitability/e˜ectiveness of a programme if the same \\nsort of information is provided. ˚e assumption that evaluation is intended for learning \\nfundamentally di˜ers from evaluations meant for control therefore does not hold true. we see \\nmore importance in furthering awareness for the notion of evaluation as such, i.e. it is not a \\nmanagement but an assessment tool irrespective of its intention. ˚is should be the dominant \\nnarrative on evaluations shared by both evaluated actors and the management.\\nthere is no ˜xed mechanism to guarantee independence \\nensuring independence is a continuous process. establishing a uniform understanding of \\nindependence among sta˜ and ensuring formal independence by corresponding organizational \\nstructures does not automatically mean that independence is guaranteed. ˚e interviews with \\nthe sta˜, for instance, revealed that there is no uniform understanding of what independence \\nfigure 2. \\n comprehensive

for others, it means closer adherence \\nto rigorous methodological standards of practice so \\nthat credibility is assured. both of these do not have \\nto exist to the same extent in each evaluat\\nion, since \\ndata for specific decisions may not have to meet \\nthe same rigorous standards as that for\\n \\ncreation of \\nnew knowledge.\\n \\n \\nthe likelihood of evaluation use is

the \\njoint \\nevaluation was included in\\n the gef ieo work program that was approved by \\nthe gef council in \\njune 2019\\n.1 the evaluation will build on the 2015 joint \\ngef\\n-undp evaluation of the \\nsgp and will focus on the period july 2014 to june 2019. \\n 2. building on the\\n 2015 joint evaluation\\n, this evaluation will \\nfocus on\\n sgp\\n™s\\n strategic mission, \\nupgrading \\npolicy\\n, use of \\nfull\\n-size projects (\\nfsps\\n) as a modality, and \\ngovernance, \\nmanagement\\n and \\noperations\\n. a shared budget of $200,000\\nš$100,000 each from the \\nindependent evalu\\nation offices of the \\ngef and undp\\nšfor this evaluation has initially been approved by the joint steering committee of the \\nevaluation on 12 september 2019. \\nthis\\n approach paper \\nhas\\n be\\nen developed jointly \\nby \\nthe \\nieos of \\ngef\\n and \\nundp\\n. the joint evaluation \\nwill \\nbe submitted to the gef council in december 2020 and presented to the \\nundp executive board in \\njune\\n 2021\\n. b. background\\n and \\ncontext\\n 3. the gef created the sgp in 1992 with the explicit aim of developing community\\n-led and \\n-owned \\nstrategies and technologies for reducing threats to the global environment\\nšnotably in connection with \\nbiodiversity loss, mitigating climate change, \\nland degradatio\\nn \\nand protecting international waters\\n, \\nchemical and waste management \\nšwhile addressing livelihood challenges. the principal strategy of the \\nsgp is to provide small grants\\nšup to a maximum of $50,000\\n2što needy communities to support the use \\nof practices and \\ntechnologies that benefit the global environment. \\n 4. the sgp \\nis a corporate gef program implemented by undp. the united nations office for project \\nservices (unops)\\n, the executing \\nagency of the \\nglobal \\nprogram,\\n provides financial and administrative \\nsupport to \\nthe program\\n at the country and \\nglobal\\n levels. \\noverall\\n strategic and programming direct\\nions\\n, \\nsupervision and technical support are provided by \\na central programme management team (cpmt) \\nbased \\nin new york.\\n3 each participating country \\nhas a \\nlocally recruited \\nsgp national coordinator\\n, and\\n often a \\n 1 gef/me/c.56/03, four\\n-year work program and budget of the gef independent

in practice the \\naverage grant amount \\nis\\n approximately $25,000\\n. through a strat\\negic projects window, grants up to \\n$150,000 \\nare provided \\nto \\nbetter \\nenable scal\\ning\\n up, \\nand\\n to cover\\n a large\\nr number of\\n communities within a critical landscape or \\nseascape.\\n at the time of writing 81 active projects \\nhave a budget of more than \\n$50,000.\\n 3 cpmt consists of eight staff including a global manager, a deputy global manager, program advisers on the gef \\nfocal areas, a program specialist for knowledge management, a monitoring and evaluation specialist and two \\nprogram associates.\\n together, they pro\\nvide global supervision and day\\n-to-day programmatic and operational \\nguidance to over \\n125 countries that are part of the sgp global program. in the 15\\n upgraded countries\\n, cpmt is \\n     2   program assistant\\n. the national coordinator is often associated with and supported by the undp country \\noffice or\\n hosted in a nongovernmental organization \\n(ngo) that acts as a national host institution. \\neach \\nparticipati\\nng \\ncountry develops a country program strategy \\n(cps) \\nfor each sgp operational phase \\nthat \\nadapts the sgp global strategic framework to specific \\ncountry conditions\\n4. national steering committees \\nprovide major substantive contributions to and oversight of the\\nir respective sgp country program\\n as key \\ngovernance structure at the country level\\n. the national steering committee, whose members are \\nvolunteers, typically comprises representatives from local \\ncivil society organiza\\ntions (csos)\\n, government, \\nacademia, undp\\n and occasionally \\nother gef agencies \\nsuch as conservation international\\n, \\ninternational \\nunion for conservation of nature, and world wildlife fund,\\n as well as\\n other \\ncofounding donors, \\nindigenous peoples™ organizations, the private sector, and the media; a majority of members \\nshould be \\nnongovernment\\nal, respecting the \\ncso\\n-led \\nnature of the program\\n. grants are awarded directly to \\ncommunity\\n-based organizations \\n(cbos) \\nand \\nngos. the use of local \\ncsos\\n and/or cbos as grantee partners \\nimplies a built\\n-in preference for projects requiring community involvement.\\n 5. sgp aim\\ns to contribute to resolving global environmental and sustainable development \\nchallenges by providing small grant\\ns to communities and csos for projects aligned with the strategic \\npriorities of the gef and within the framework of sustainable development. the sgp targets community\\n-level initiatives across the range of global environmental issues addressed by the gef an\\nd seeks to \\nintegrate actions that lead to poverty reduction

grants with a total of $653 million in \\ngrants. \\n most of the projects are multi\\n-focal in nature, however\\n, for reporting purpose, grantees \\nare \\n asked \\nto select the most dominant focal are\\na.  \\nhistorical\\nly, biodiversity projects\\n have \\nconstitute\\nd the large\\nst share of the global sgp portfolio. climate change\\n projects (including adaptation) come second after the \\nbiodiversity ones and are followed by land degradation projects. these three sgp project areas co\\nnstitute \\nthe large majority of the global sgp portfolio, corresponding to 83 percent of the total number of projects, \\nand 84 percent of the total grant budget.\\n 7. the sgp is a tool for the gef to achieve global environmental benefits while addressing the \\nlive\\nlihood needs

empowerment, relevant to the \\nlocal \\ncontext.\\n c. previous evaluations of the \\nsgp\\n 11. the 2008 joint evaluation was presented to the council in november 2007 and assessed the \\nrelevance of \\nsgp results to the gef and to country and environmental priorities, the effectiveness of the \\nsgp in generating global environmental benefits, and the efficiency of the sgp in engaging community\\n-based groups and \\ncivil society\\n organizations\\n. the most recent \\njoint evaluation of the sgp was presented \\nto the gef council in june 2015 and to the undp executive board in september 2015 and built on \\nthe \\n2008 joint evaluation of the sgp. \\nthe \\nevaluation covered four main areas: (1) current role and results of \\nthe sgp: \\neffectiveness in achieving global environmental benefits while addressing livelihoods, poverty, \\nand gender; (2) broader adoption issues; (3) the sgp™s strategic positioning; and (4) efficiency issues, \\nincluding monitoring and evaluation (m&e). particular a\\nttention was given to the upgrading of sgp \\ncountry programs and related policies.\\n 12. the main conclusions\\n of these evaluations\\n were:\\n  as of 2015, t\\nhe sgp continue\\nd to support communities with projects that are effective, efficient, \\nand relevant. \\nreplication\\n, s\\ncaling\\n-up, and mainstreaming are occurring\\n, building on the 2008 \\nconclusion that sgp is a cost\\n-effective way for the gef to generate global environmental benefits \\nwhile addressing country priorities and responding to the needs of local populations.\\n  in 2008\\n, the evaluation found that the management model had reached its limits and was not \\nsuitable for a new phase of growth\\n. in 2015, \\nthe sgp governance and management structures \\nwere found to be\\n adequate but \\nwere\\n increasingly\\n strained by an ever rapidly changi\\nng context\\n. the 2008 joint gef\\n-undp sgp evaluation was crucial in shaping the way forward for the sgp and \\nprovided the foundation for the implementation of several important changes, some of which \\nwere essential for making it possible to broaden the \\nprogram to more countries. in 2015, the \\nevaluation noted that the introduction of upgrading and related policies contributed to the \\nevolution of the sgp by setting out expectations for country programs and their development \\nover time. the new policies have\\n resulted in increased resources for the sgp but also brought \\nchallenges. the sgp was found to have remained coherent while staying flexible, but the global \\nor long\\n-term vision of the sgp had not been updated.\\n it was recommended that the criteria for \\nupgra\\nding be reviewed.\\n  in 2008, the \\nevaluation\\n highlighted the need to strengthen audit processes and oversight\\n. in 2015\\n, the evaluation noted significant improvements but stressed that \\nm&e \\nwas\\n not adequately \\nsupport\\ning\\n decision making and remains too complex\\n. in relation to the upgrading process, the \\nevaluation found that the ﬁimplementation of the sgp through two separate mechanisms (as fsps \\nand under the cpmt)ﬂ undermined knowledge management and complicated m&e.\\n 13. apar\\nt from the key conclusions presented above, previous evaluations drew the following \\nconclusions on priority issues for the current evaluation (see section ii):\\n      6    innovation: \\nwhile the 2008 evaluation did not focus on this aspect and only highlighted that one\\n program was found to act as ﬁincubator\\n,ﬂ the 2015 evaluation concluded that sgp, in its delivery \\nof global environmental objectives, put an emphasis on ﬁinnovation and piloting\\n,ﬂ but could not \\nindependently verify available monitoring information and conc\\nluded that in some cases, the \\nﬁtype of innovationﬂ introduced was not clear.\\n  sustainability\\n and broader adoption\\n: in 2008, the evaluation found that benefits from most of the \\ncompleted projects were likely to continue in the future. i\\nn 2015, the evaluation\\n concluded that \\nthe achievements of the sgp were being replicated at the local scale, up\\n-scaled and mainstreamed \\ninto\\n local and, at times, national development processes. \\nin terms of broader adoption, the 2015 \\nevaluation could verify that it was taking pla\\nces in several cases, including through replication and \\nupscaling, but also mainstreaming, especially in more mature programs. in 2008, the evaluation \\nhad already highlighted that sgp was contributing to institutional and policy change.\\n  gender: the 2008 evaluation assessed the gender component of sgp under the framework of an \\n\\nassessment of progress in targeting efforts to \\nbenefit the poor\\n and marginalized\\n. it concluded that \\nwhile there was room for improvement in targeting the poor\\n, indig\\nenous peoples, and women, \\nthe extent to which sgp grants targeted these groups seemed adequate, given overall program \\nobjectives. the evaluation found that 21 out of the 22 reviewed countries included women as a \\npriority target group. in 2015, the evaluati\\non concluded that sgp was continuing to promote \\ngender equality and empowering women\\n: 20 of the 30 cpss reviewed\\n were found to\\n have a \\nrelatively strong approach to gender\\n and national sgp stakeholders generally believed that \\nattention to gender and women™s\\n empowerment has strengthened the country™s ability to meet \\nenvironmental objectives\\n. ii. purpose, objectives, and audience\\n a.\\n purpose\\n and \\nobjective\\n 14. the overall purpose of this joint evaluation is to \\nexamine the gef sgp\\n, an important\\n corporate \\nprogram\\n of the gef\\n, and to \\ndetermine\\n whether any changes \\nare required to improve effectiveness of the \\nsgp\\n. the aim of the joint evaluation is to \\nprovide the gef council and the undp executive board with \\nevaluative evidence of the sgp™s relevance, \\neffectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability\\n.  15. the main objective of this joint evaluation is to build on the findings of\\n, and evaluate progress \\nmade\\n, since the 2015 joint sgp evaluation and the extent\\n to which the sgp is achieving the objectives set \\nout in its strategic and operational directions under gef\\n-6 (20\\n14-2018) \\nand gef\\n-7 (201\\n8-2022)\\n. the \\nevaluation will also assess the relevance and strategic pos\\nitioning of the sgp within the gef and provide \\nrecommendations on the way forward for the sgp.\\n b. stakeholders \\nand\\n audience\\n 16. the primary stakeholders are the gef secretariat \\nsenior management and \\nstaff, \\nundp \\nsenior \\nmanagement and \\nstaff\\n, unops, \\nthe \\nsgp cpmt\\n, ge\\nf council members\\n and undp executive board \\n     7   member\\ns. secondary stakeholders \\nare \\nsgp national coordinators and their program assistants, national \\nsteering committee\\ns, staff from governments, \\ncsos, \\nbeneficiaries\\n and\\n other gef stakeholders.\\n 17. the evaluation™s ta\\nrget audience are the gef council members and undp board members, other \\ngef and undp stakeholders, as well as the general public and professionals interested \\nin \\ndevelopment \\nand small grants programs.\\n iii. coverage and \\nevaluation \\nquestions\\n a.\\n coverage\\n 18. the \\nfocus\\n of this evaluation\\n will be \\non \\ndevelopments since \\njuly 2014\\n, which was the cut\\n-off date \\nfor the 2015 joint evaluation of the sgp\\n, to december 2019\\n. the \\n2015 joint evaluation provided an \\nassessment of the \\nrelevance and strategic positioning, \\neffectiven\\ness\\n, \\nand \\nefficiency, of the sgp with a \\nstrong \\nemphasis on country results\\n. this current evaluation will \\nalso assess relevance, effectiveness, and \\nefficiency \\nwhile \\nemphasi\\nzing\\n sgp\\n™s\\n strategic mission\\n and upgrading \\npolicy\\n, \\ninnovation, \\ngender \\nconsiderations\\n, \\ngovernance structure,\\n and sustainability of \\noutcomes in ucps\\n. 19. attention will be given to \\nthe promotion of \\ninnovation\\n. under gef\\n-7, the sgp\\n, once \\noperationalized,\\n will\\n have \\na stronger focus \\non supporting innovative \\ninitiatives at the local level to protect \\nthe \\nglobal environment in priority \\nland\\nscapes\\n and seascapes\\n. sgp is\\n encouraged to support \\nprojects that \\ncould be incubators of innovation\\n for potential broader replication\\n of successful \\napproaches\\n financed by \\nthe g\\nef or other\\n partner\\ns.8 according to the \\nsgp implementation arrangements for gef\\n-7, \\nthe sgp \\nis \\nlaunching programs to \\nsupport emerging new themes under its strategic initiatives.\\n9 the joint evaluation \\nwill \\nassess\\n innovation in the sg\\np using the following definition: \\ninnovation is the application or \\nintroduction of a technology, product, process, or practice that is new or perceived to be new for a specific \\ncontext with a purpose to catalyze greater global environmental benefits. it is \\ncontext\\n-specific; what is \\nnew and innovative in one context is not necessarily new and innovative in another.\\n 20. the 2015 joint evaluation assessed sustainability\\n of sgp \\noutcomes \\nand found \\nsustainability \\nratings \\ncomparable \\nto \\nthose for other gef projects\\n. thi\\ns joint evaluation will focus \\non\\n the sustainability of \\nucp\\ns, including in relation to the implementation modalities\\n. the joint evaluation will \\nassess the \\nlikelihood \\nof \\nthe sustainability of outcomes\\n of all ucps\\n. for completed projects\\n, the \\nassess\\nment will \\nalso include\\n the \\nratings \\nand discussion \\nof sustainability of outcomes\\n in terminal evaluations\\n.  21. as \\nit \\nwas \\nin \\nthe \\n2015 joint evaluation\\n, gender will be a key component in this evaluation. \\ngender \\nequality and women™s empowerment are \\ncentral\\n objectives of the sgp at the global and local levels. \\nin \\nline with the gef \\npolicy on \\ngender\\n equality\\n10 and \\nthe \\nundp \\ngender \\nequality \\nstrategy\\n11, sgp\\n uses two \\n 8 gef/r.7/19, gef\\n-7 replenishment programming directions, april 2018.\\n 9

defined\\n in the preceding \\nsection, this joint\\n evaluation will seek to answer the following key questions\\n13, based on evidence from \\n2014 to \\ndecember \\n2019\\n. relevance\\n  to what extent is the sgp guided by a \\nvision\\n, policy and strategy\\n which ensures coherent and \\neffective implementation of a program which remains\\n relevant to national priorities\\n, and \\ngef\\n and\\n undp \\npriorities?\\n  to what extent is the upgrading process providing a strategic\\n long\\n-term mechanism to ensure \\nthe \\neffective delivera\\nble of environmental benefits at community level, both in uc\\nps and in the \\nglobal \\nprogram \\ncountries?\\n effectiveness\\n  to what extent is the sgp contributing to the delivery of \\nglobal\\n and local\\n

\\nhindering \\nthis\\n?  c. assessing \\nperformance\\n 23. the sgp™s performance will be assessed in terms of the degree to which the sgp has operated in \\naccordance with the gef sgp implem\\nentation arrangements for gef\\n-6 and gef\\n-7, and has achieved \\nundp\\n-established objectives and indicators for its implementation of the sgp program. regarding the \\ncountry level, both the performance related to achievement of emerging results of upgraded count\\nry \\nprograms and of the sgp global program will be assessed against stated goals.\\n iv.\\n evaluation \\ndesign\\n a.\\n methodology\\n 24. the evaluation™s methodological approach is expected to include the following main elements:\\n  document review\\n: review of documentation will includ\\ne gef council and gef secretariat policy \\nand operational guidance papers; sgp steering committee documents; sgp global knowledge \\nmanagement, communications, and technical guidance products; sgp cpss and project \\ndocuments; undp and cpmt planning documents; \\nannual reports\\n and pirs\\n; and\\n country \\nand \\nucp \\nterminal \\nevaluations\\n. also,\\n a systematic review\\n, to the extent that they are available, evaluations \\nand reviews of small grants program\\ns admini\\nstered by \\nother\\n donors and international \\norganizations\\n.  portfolio re\\nview\\n: the assessment of the environmental \\nand socio\\n-economic \\nbenefits delivered by \\nsgp will be based \\non \\na review of \\ndata and information from the sgp database maintained by the \\ncpmt \\nand \\nucp \\nterminal evaluations \\nas well as \\non an analysis of \\navailable evaluative evidence, \\nother literary review (e.g. independent academic studies) complemented by\\n a review of the \\nquality at entry of the \\nproject documents for \\nfull\\n-size \\nprojects,\\n a limited number of case studies, \\nsurveys and targeted interviews bas\\ned on survey results\\n.  meta\\n-assessment\\n: since the 2015 joint sgp evaluation the gef and undp ieos and \\nindependent \\nevaluation\\n units of the gef agencies\\n have conducted evaluations related to the sgp\\nšincluding \\n     10   the ops6 evaluation of the star, country evaluatio\\nns, and terminal evaluations. a meta\\n-assessment\\n will be conducted to aggregate findings from all relevant and available evaluations.\\n  interviews\\n: the evaluation team will interview a wide range of stakeholders including sgp staff \\nfrom undp and unops, undp s\\ntaff involved with the gef in new york, and gef secretariat staff \\nin washington, dc, sgp\\n-involved staff and stakeholders at the regional (mainly undp technical \\nregional teams) and country levels (sgp national coordinators and their program assistants, and \\nnational steering committee members where possible). additional interviews will be conducted \\nat the country level as part of the case studies. interview\\n protocols \\nwill be developed\\n.  country visits\\n: five \\ncountry visits including two\\n to three\\n countries\\n with \\nupgraded programs\\n, \\nplus \\none \\ncountry \\nwith a program \\nthat \\nis likely to \\nbe \\nupgrade\\nd in the coming two \\nphases\\n, one \\ncountry \\nwhich join\\ned sgp recently\\n and\\n a long standing participant to the program\\n. countries \\nidentified \\nthrough the \\nportfolio review\\n as \\nbeing innovative\\n will be given a preference. \\nspecific terms of \\nreference, interview protocols, and review protocols aimed at capturing evaluative evidence in \\nresponse to the main areas of inquiry will be developed for these visits.\\n  tria\\nngulation:\\n the \\nevaluation\\n team will conduct an analysis of\\n, and triangulate, \\ndata collected to \\ndetermine trends, \\nformulate \\nmain findings, lessons and conclusions. different stakeholders will \\nbe consulted during the process to test preliminary findings. als\\no see ﬁv. quality assurance\\n.ﬂ b. design \\nchallenges\\n 25. in addition to advantages\\n, there are well recognized challenges \\nin conducting \\njoint evaluation\\ns. \\nlesson from the 2008 and 2015 joint evaluations of the sgp show that institutional arrangements can \\nbecome time consuming and a limitation to the evaluation. \\nthe evaluation will take care to keep \\narrangements simple\\n, especially \\nthose \\nregarding the activ\\nities of\\n the joint steering committee.\\n 26. another limitation is that due to \\ntime and budget constraints only a small number of participating \\ncountries will be visited\\n, which limits \\ncountry and project level data t\\nhat can be collected \\nfrom \\nstakeholders \\nand the\\n assessment of effectiveness at the project and country levels\\n. this will be mitigated \\nby combining country visits with other ongoing evaluations or evaluation work by the ieos of the gef and \\nundp. \\n 27. the\\n lack of\\n complete\\n and comprehensive\\n information in the\\n project management information \\nsystem (pmis)\\n, especially on project status\\n, and the transition to the new gef portal\\n may\\n pose challenges \\nto the underlying analysis.\\n data will be compared with council work program documents and the cpmt \\nwill be requested t\\no verify the data prior to analysis.\\n v. evaluation management and \\nquality \\nassurance\\n  28. as was the case in the earlier joint evaluations, th\\nis joint gef\\n-undp sgp evaluation will be a \\nshared\\n effort by the gef and undp evaluation offices as equal partners. the exe\\ncution structure of the \\nevaluation will be composed of three tiers:\\n      11    the steering committee, co\\n-chaired by \\njuha uitto\\n, director of the gef independent evaluation \\noffice\\n (ieo)\\n and\\n indran naidoo,\\n14 director of the undp independent evaluation office\\n (ieo)\\n; and \\ncomposed of \\ncarlo carugi, senior evaluation officer, gef ieo \\nand\\n alan fox\\n, chief of section,\\n undp \\nieo\\n. the committee reviews and approves the \\napproach paper\\n, the joint management \\narrangements,\\n including the management of the budget (see vii\\n. b.), sel\\nection and hiring of \\nconsultants, and the evaluation report.\\n it ensures that sufficient and timely resources (human and \\nfinancial) are made available for the evaluation. the committee will jointly chair a formal meeting \\nwith agency representatives and stak\\neholders to discuss the emerging findings of the evaluation. \\nthis committee will also review and resolve disputes if they arise.\\n  the management team, formed by two task managers,\\n anna viggh\\n from the gef \\nieo and\\n elisa \\ncalcaterra\\n from the undp \\nieo\\n, will be r\\nesponsible for the overall development and execution of \\nthe evaluation. these comanagers will be responsible for the identification, hiring, and \\nsupervision of consultants in accordance with mutually agreed\\n-upon terms of reference and \\ninstitutional procedu\\nres; coordination of evaluation activities carried out by both offices; quality \\ncontrol of products and processes; and the timely delivery of evaluation products.\\n the \\ncomanagers will be supported by \\npeixuan zhou, evaluation analyst\\n from the gef ieo\\n and \\nharvey \\ngarcia, associate lead evaluator and \\njonathan vegan, research associate at\\n undp ieo\\n.   the evaluation team will be composed of one lead consultant\\n and\\n one national consultant per \\ncountry study\\n. consultants will respond directly to the \\nmanagement team and conduct specific \\ntasks as directed by the management team.\\n 29. in line with the offices™ quality assurance practice, quality assurance measures have been set up \\nfor this evaluation. the draft approach paper and draft evaluation report will \\nbe circulated and validated \\nbefore finalization through a comprehensive stakeholder feedback process with the key stakeholders. in \\nthe case of the draft evaluation report this will take place prior to the december council in 2020 and \\nexecutive board in \\njun\\ne \\n2021. key stakeholders include the gef secretariat,\\n undp and unops,\\n the sgp \\ncpmt\\n, \\nand select\\n sgp national coordinators\\n. comments, feedback and suggestions will be considered, \\nand the approach paper and final report will be adjusted accordingly. additiona\\nlly, the draft approach \\npaper \\nwill\\n be internally reviewed in the gef \\nand undp \\nieo\\ns. vi.\\n deliverables and dissemination\\n 30. the main findings, conclusions, and recommendations will be\\n presented to the gef council and \\nundp executive board\\n in the required report form\\nats\\n. for the gef \\nieo \\nthe council document will be \\npresented to the december 2020 council meeting. it will be distributed to the council members, gef \\nsecretariat, undp\\n, and gef focal points. \\na graphically edited version will be published \\nas open access \\non \\nthe \\ngef \\nieo™s website and will also be made available to interested parties through email. a four\\n-page \\nsummary of the report will be produced and posted on the website. the above\\n-mentioned outputs will \\nbe distributed through existing ieo mailing lists as we\\nll as to stakeholders involved in the conduct of the \\n 14 at the time of writing.\\n      12   evaluation. to reach a wider audience the evaluation will also be presented through webinars and at \\nrelevant evaluation conferences and workshops such as adaptation futures.\\n 31. for the undp ieo, the draft r\\neport will be shared with undp senior management for comment\\n (15 working days) and a management response (20 working days) will be prepared based on the final draft \\nreport (a revised report for management response no later than 15 days after receiving cons\\nolidated \\ncomments). an executive board paper (submitted at least 8\\n-12 weeks in advance of the session targeted), \\nincluding the report summary and the management response will be edited and translated by un \\ntranslation services. the final report will be upl\\noaded to the e\\nxecutive \\nboard\\n website (at least 6 weeks \\nbefore the board session) and presented at the \\nexecutive board\\n session in june 2021.\\n the \\nfinal \\nreport will \\nalso be publicly

of the \\ngef and undp\\nšfor this evaluation has initially been approved by the joint steering committee of the \\nevaluation on september \\n12, \\n2019. \\nthe budget will be managed in a fully transparent and equal way. \\na \\nfurther breakdown of cost elements will be provided.\\n      14   annex \\na: conclusions and recommendations of the 201\\n5 joint \\nevaluation of the small grants programme\\n conclusions\\n in \\nthe joint\\n evaluation of the \\nsmall grant programme\\n, the independent evaluation office\\ns of the gef and \\nundp\\n reached the following \\nfive\\n conclusions:\\n conc\\nlusion 1: the sgp continues to support communities\\n with projects that are effective, efficient,\\n and \\nrelevant in achieving global environmental benefits\\n while addressing livelihoods and poverty as\\n well as \\npromoting gender equality and empowering\\n women. repl\\nication, scaling\\n-up, and mainstreaming\\n are \\noccurring.\\n conclusion 2: the introduction of upgrading and related policies contributed to the evolution of the sgp \\nby setting out expectations for country programs and their development over time. the new policie\\ns have \\nresulted in increased resources for the sgp, but have also brought challenges. the current criteria for \\nselecting countries to upgrade to full\\n-size projects are not optimal.\\n conclusion 3: as a global program that acts nationally and locally and is g\\nrassroots driven, the sgp must \\nalign to gef, undp, national, and local priorities. within this context, the sgp has remained coherent \\n\\nwhile staying flexible. however, different perspectives and changing contexts create tensions. the global \\nor long\\n-term vis\\nion of the sgp has not been updated.\\n conclusion 4: the sgp governance and management structures have been adequate, but are increasingly \\n\\nstrained by an ever rapidly changing context. the gef corporate nature of the sgp and the role and value \\nadded of undp \\nas the gef agency are not clearly articulated.\\n conclusion 5: despite important progress, m&e does not adequately support decision making and \\nremains too complex.\\n recommendations\\n in \\nthe joint\\n evaluation of the \\nsmall grant programme\\n, the \\nindependent evaluation office\\ns of the gef and \\nundp\\n reached the following \\nfour\\n recommendations:\\n to the gef\\n recommendation 1: revitalize the sgp steering committee to support high\\n-level strategic thinking in \\ndeveloping a long\\n-term vision for the sgp, to fost\\ner dialogue between undp and the gef, and to advise \\nthe council as appropriate on strategic decision making.\\n to the gef and undp\\n recommendation 2: continue upgrading, building on strengths while addressing the weaknesses \\n\\nidentified. the criteria for select\\ning countries for upgrading should be revisited.\\n        15   to undp\\n recommendation 3: ensure that the sgp is implemented under a single, coherent global program \\nframework.\\n to undp and the cpmt\\n recommendation 4: continue efforts to improve m&e, designing more stream\\nlined and useful m&e \\ntools and activities that balance the need to measure with the need to provide support to local \\ncommunities in tackling environmental issues.\\n       16   annex \\nb: guidelines for gender mainstreaming and women \\nempowerment \\nin sgp\\n15 ł gender is one o\\nf the main criteria considered for the approval of grants.\\n ł promotion of gender mainstreaming at the earliest stages of the project cycle starting with carrying \\ngender analysis where men and women analyse their roles in the community and project, and \\npart\\nicipate in project conception, approval, implementation and monitoring. this helps minimize conflict \\namong different stakeholders during and after the project cycle with respect to roles in project activities \\nand sharing of project benefits.\\n ł document the\\n contribution of women to project activities in key areas where women already figure \\nprominently (e.g., biodiversity management, in situ conservation of agrobiodiversity, conservation of \\n\\nmedicinal plants, etc.). this contributes significantly to enhanced i\\nntegration of gender considerations in \\ncurrent and future projects.\\n ł sgp national steering committees employ a checklist and criteria to assess and screen projects for \\nhow they mainstream gender. moreover, some sgp countries have developed gender guidelin\\nes to \\nmainstream gender into the project cycle.\\n ł sgp™s demand\\n-driven approach at the local level increases the likelihood of receiving proposals from \\nwomen and marginalized groups.\\n ł sgp holds ﬁproposal writing workshopsﬂ and accepts project proposals in \\nlocal languages and even in \\n\\noral formats through participatory video proposals. thus encouraging maximum participation by \\nwomen, indigenous peoples and youth.\\n ł sgp encourages women stand\\n-alone projects in line with the gef focal areas.\\n ł grantees are \\nencouraged to participate in the global peer\\n-learning network.\\n ł field evaluation, including monitoring and evaluation and participatory appraisals, incorporates \\ngender\\n-based indicators to track the status of gender mainstreaming in projects.\\n ł gender\\n-focu\\nsed training and sensitization workshops are provided for national coordinators at the \\nregional level and for grantees at the national level.\\n ł national steering committees\\nša voluntary body that makes all decisions on grant making\\nšare \\nrequired to include a\\n gender specialist.\\n ł national coordinators performance is explicitly assessed with respect to results achieved in promotion \\nof gender equality and

focus on results, inclusive partnerships, and \\ntransparency and mu\\ntual accountability) and informs three sdg global indicators (sdg 5.c.1, sdg 17.15.1 and \\nsdg 17.16.1). \\nfollowing the refinement of the global partnership monitoring in 2017\\n-\\n2018, which explored \\nstronger consideration of monitoring with sdg framework as wel\\nl as a context specific approach to \\neffectiveness monitoring in fragile and conflict\\n-\\naffected countries, the third\\n-\\nround monitoring process was \\nconcluded in 2019, with 86 partner countries and territories, in collaboration with more than 100 \\ndevelopment pa\\nrtners, providing data as part of the monitoring exercise. \\nthe record number of partner \\ncountries undertaking the effectiveness monitoring is a testimony that the effectiveness agenda remains \\nrelevant in country\\n-\\nled efforts to drive inclusive and effective\\n \\npartnerships for 2030 agenda. undp together with oecd \\nsupported

actions for \\nmore effectiv\\ne partnerships needed to achieve the 2030 agenda. the 2019 progress report informed the \\ndevelopment effectiveness dialogue at the global \\n\\n \\nsenior level meeting in 2019. \\n \\n \\n86 individual country and territory profiles.\\n \\nusing the data generated \\nb\\ny governments and development partners for the 2018 monitoring \\nround, \\n86 individual country and territory profiles \\nwere produced in \\n2019 by the oecd/undp joint s\\nupport team to complement the 2019 \\nglobal progress report. each country profile provides a snapshot of a \\ncou\\n\\ndevelopment \\ncooperation\\n. in order to implement, measure, follow\\n-\\nup \\nand review changes at the country and local levels, the specific \\nobjective of each monitoring profiles was to establish a concrete \\nevidence\\n-\\nbase for tracking and \\nanalyzing\\n \\nprogress in effective \\ndevelopment \\ncooper\\nation\\n, taking into \\nconsideration\\n \\ncountry context \\nand typology in assessing progress and bottlenecks, sharing good \\npractices and lessons learned, and facilitating policy dialogue at \\nnational, regional and global levels. due to resource constraints \\nwhereby,\\n \\nno specific resource was made available to produce country \\nand territory profiles, the individual profiles were produced using only \\nthe data generated from the 2018 monitoring round, without \\nadditional country\\n-\\nlevel analysis, scoping and dialogue. thus, it\\n \\nwas not possible for the profiles to include \\nspecific policy and partnership recommendations for more effective cooperation at country level. \\n \\n \\nthe data visualization dashboard.\\n  \\nglobal partnership monitoring results are further shared through an \\ninteract\\nive \\ndata visualization dashboard\\n, which was developed in 2017. this visualization tool allows users \\nto: 1) view results for specific country or development partner; 2) explore progress in dif\\nferent areas of \\neffective development \\ncooperation\\n \\nby viewing performance overtime; 3) compare the results of countries or \\ndevelopment partners within similar region or context; 4) discover how country or organizations are \\nimplementing effectiveness commitm\\nents. following the conclusion of the 2018 monitoring round new data \\nfor all reporting entities was added. the dashboard also includes data from the 2005, 2007 and 2010\\n \\nparis \\naid effective\\nness monitoring process\\n \\nto better illustrate historical trends for relevant indicators.\\n \\n \\ndeveloping approaches\\n \\nto measure the effectiveness of south\\n-\\nsouth cooperation (ssc).\\n \\nin 2019, the global \\npartnership continued work to adapt its monitoring framework to reflect the challenges and opportunities of \\nthe 2030 agenda and the sdgs. this adaptation is informed from country\\n-\\nled initiatives to adapt the global \\n\\nork to ensure its relevance to specific cooperation contexts of \\nsouth\\n-\\nsouth cooperation partners. for example, the government of mexico spearheaded an initiative to \\ndevelop an approach to monitor the effectiveness of its ssc, and conducted a national data \\ncollection \\nexercise, in which over 100 stakeholders from across the national government, civil society and the private \\nsector participated in 2017 and 2018. building on this initiative, undp engaged several southern providers to \\nbegin to gauge the applicab\\nility of the mexico pilot framework to other contexts. officials from chile, \\nindonesia, malaysia and south africa participated in an online questionnaire, followed by a series of \\ninterviews. these consultations examined how ssc is organised and provided, i\\nncluding whether these \\n \\n \\n14\\n \\nproviders have national and sub\\n-\\nnational strategies in place to guide \\ncooperation\\n,\\n \\nthe process for deciding \\non ssc interventions, including how these arrangements are formalised and which stakeholders are involved \\nat different stages\\n \\nof providing cooperation. the results of the mexico pilot exercise and the perspectives of \\nthese other southern providers were shared during a undp\\n-\\nsupported bapa+40 side event, \\nensuring \\neffective south\\n-\\nsouth \\ncooperation\\n \\nto accelerate achievement of the 2030 agenda\\n, \\nwhich took place on 21 \\nmarch 2019 in buenos aires, argentina. these member \\nstates led initiatives have informed the \\noutcome \\ndocument of the second high\\n-\\nlevel united nations conference on south\\n-\\nsouth cooperation (bapa+40),\\n \\nwhich recognizes the need to enhance the d\\nevelopment effectiveness of ssc while still acknowledging the \\nunique nature of ssc partnerships.  this work was further showcased at the \\n2019 senior\\n-\\nlevel meeting.\\n \\n \\n \\nii.\\n \\nan\\n \\nincreased\\n \\nn\\number\\n \\nof\\n \\ncountries\\n \\nstrengthened,\\n \\nor\\n \\nare\\n

\\n\\nlong\\n-\\n \\n\\npartnership policy (approved in 2013) sets out \\nprinciples for the management of the relationship \\nbetween the government and development \\npartners, within the context of the uganda national \\ndevelo\\npment plan (ndpii).\\n \\n \\nthe policy defines the roles of key government \\nauthorities and aims to strengthen overall \\ncoordination and alignment of development \\ncooperation. \\nto support the policy, the government \\nand development partners agreed on a framework \\nfor joint dialogue, which \\nincludes instruments of the \\npartnership policy, a high\\n-\\nlevel national partnership \\nforum (npf), a technical npf and engagement \\nthrough swgs and a local development partners \\ngroup (ldpg). \\n \\n \\nthis cooperation architecture has not evolved with \\nthe changing coun\\ntry context, including a financing \\nlandscape increasingly dominated by loans and \\nequity investments and more diverse partners that \\noperate outside of government systems. such \\nchanges have made effective partnerships more \\ndifficult. \\nto address this challeng\\ne, the global \\npartnership country pilot in uganda, with specific \\nfunding made available by germany, supported a \\nreview of the cooperation architecture, aiming to \\nprovide recommendations on how to adapt \\nmechanisms to the new country reality. \\n \\n \\nthe comprehensive review examined how \\nexisting structures support implementation of \\nthe effectiveness principles and looked at \\nlessons drawn from other countries. \\n \\n \\nthe result of the pilot process was a series of \\noptions discussed a\\nmong country\\n-\\nlevel \\nstakeholders. several suggestions included: 1) \\nreforming the national partnership forum and \\ncommitting additional resources to ensure it can \\nmeet the needs of all the stakeholders; 2) \\nestablish a second annual partnership event that \\nbrin\\ngs together a more diverse group of \\nstakeholders at a lower level, which could then \\ninform national partnership forum dialogue; \\nand 3) a possibility of integrating the partnership \\npolicy with a development cooperation policy \\nand framework that specifically\\n \\nspeaks to \\ncountry\\n-\\nlevel effectiveness issues. \\n \\n \\nas a result, existing coordination mechanisms \\nand ongoing integrated and inclusive dialogue, \\nincluding effective engagement of all \\nstakeholders, were strengthened and a specific \\nroadmap for strengthened effe\\nctiveness, \\ninforming the next generation of the \\ncooperation architecture in uganda, was \\ndeveloped.\\n \\n \\n \\n16\\n \\npilot\\n \\nconclusion\\n \\nworkshop.\\n \\non\\n \\n9\\n-\\n10\\n \\nmay\\n \\n2019,\\n \\nthe\\n \\n\\n \\neffectiveness\\n \\nat\\n \\ncountry\\n

by the \\ngovernment, thi\\ns new agency aims to enhance effectiveness and \\naccountability \\nin the\\n \\nprovision of \\ninternational development cooperation. the indonesian aid will boost mutual \\nefforts of development actors \\nand partner countries to meet joint commitments, improve how they wo\\nrk together, thereby increasing \\ndevelopment effectiveness. in this context, \\nundp, with funding from norway, supported the formulation of \\n\\nrecommenda\\ntions for the related governance mechanisms and strategic management. it also contributed to \\n\\nselection procedures for

for sustainable development 2017\\n-\\n2021\\n \\n(peds), which is aligned with the 2030 agenda and \\nprovides an integrated vision of structural tr\\nansformations required for long\\n-\\nterm sustainable development \\nand resilience. \\nthe peds was\\n \\ndesigned using a multi\\n-\\nstakeholder participatory approach, ensuring \\ninvolvement of the central administration and local governments, national entities and institution\\ns, civil \\nsociety \\norganizations\\n, the private sector and development partners. however, a strong alignment between \\nnational development strategy and local priorities remained critical for coherent planning, as it enables local \\nentities to effectively contrib\\nute to development efforts ensuring inclusive engagement of all citizens. in 2019 \\ntherefore, 9 out of 22 municipalities adopted municipal sustainable development plans (pemds), which were \\nelaborated within the peds policy framework and aligned with the sdg\\ns. the pemds provide a practical \\nmethodology and mech\\nanisms for \\nresource mobilization that strengthen multi\\n-\\nstakeholder dialogue to \\npromote further decentralisation. supporting this process, undp launched a flagship project financed by \\nluxembourg \\ncalled\\n \\nplataformas\\n \\npara o\\n \\ndesenvolvimento\\n \\n\\n \\ncabo verde\\n \\n(platforms for sustainable developmen\\nt and 2030 agenda in cape verde)\\n \\nwith the aim of rendering these \\ndecentralisation\\n \\nprocesses more effective and efficient. its objective is to bring together national and local \\ngovernments, the donor community, civil society and the private sector to facilitate participatory local \\ndevelopment approaches and eventually generate financing\\n \\nfor local development projects in all of the \\ncountry\\'s 22 municipalities. this\\n \\nparticipatory approach adds greater value in a way that benefits all citizens \\nand en\\nsures that no one is left behind.\\n \\n \\n \\nguinea\\n-\\nbissau:\\n \\nwith a view to advancing\\n \\nownership of co\\nuntry development priorities,\\n \\nand \\nat the request of \\nthe government of\\n \\nguinea\\n-\\nbissau, undp supported the development of a monitoring and evaluation \\nframework as part of a 5\\n-\\nyear national development plan \\n-\\n \\n\\n \\nthis process involved the alignment of the development priorities to\\n \\ninternational agendas adhered to by the \\ncountry, such as the 2030 age\\nnda, the agenda 2063, the samoa pathway for small island development \\nstates and the results of the fragility assessment conducted in the country in the framework of the new deal \\nfor fragile states. its development was\\n \\na participatory exercise, sourcing wid\\ne\\n-\\nranging inputs and fostering \\ninclusive development partnerships. it involved national ministries and public institutes, civil society, the \\nprivate sector, as well as un agencies, funds and programmes and the united nations integrated \\npeacebuilding office\\n \\nin guinea\\n-\\nbissau (uniogbis). with undp support, participants were provided with \\ntraining on

international agendas at \\n \\n \\n26\\n \\nthe same time revamping the functioning of the multi\\n-\\nstakeholder working groups.\\n \\nthe matrix is also key to \\nincrease transparency and

lower\\n-\\nmiddle\\n-\\nincome county with prospects of decreasing oda flows, is keen on \\nstrengthening the effective engagement of the private sector in multi\\n-\\nstakeholder partnerships for \\nsustainable development. several major business associati\\nons, including some of the largest companies \\naccounting for substantial shares of the honduran gdp, have expressed their interest to collect and report \\ntheir economic, social and environmental contributions towards the nationally adopted sdg agenda. to thi\\ns \\neffect, and in the spirit of the \\n\\n \\n(which undp helped introduce in the country, see \\npage 2\\n5\\n \\nof this report), a methodology for private sector data collection\\n \\nhas been devised. the related process \\n \\n \\n29\\n \\nhas been led by the honduran business council with technical support by undp and participation from both \\n\\nment co\\n-\\nordination and the ministry of foreign affairs. the \\nmethodology, based on a globally standardized measure, captures indicators on critical aspects of business \\nmodels and corporate social responsibility (csr) initiatives from participating large com\\npanies and smes, with \\nthe latter being particularly important in the honduran context where they provide 80\\n-\\n90% of all jobs. in \\ngoing forward, the aim is to expand the indicator list and the number of participating companies, with a view \\nto broadening the \\nevidence base for dialogue within the private sector and beyond. \\n \\n \\nthe undp\\n \\ncountry office in honduras has an extensive track record of supporting effectiveness of \\ndevelopment cooperation in the country. it has provided strong support and guidance to the g\\novernment in \\n\\n\\n \\nthe \\n\\nplatforma \\n\\n\\nmes, projects and \\nprogrammes in accordance to the geographical location of the beneficiaries. this information is critical for \\ngovernment \\n\\nharmonize their activities acr\\noss the country. regarding the

\\ndifficulties data entry and report generation\\n, \\nlimited integration with other government and global \\nsystems\\n \\n(e.g\\n. the international aid transparency initiative (iati)\\n)\\n \\nand delays in developer support. \\nthe new aims was \\nlaunched in mid\\n-\\n2019, collecting \\ninformation on both on and off budget development cooperatio\\nn, including \\ncooperation provided by southern\\n \\npartners, to provide a complete picture of the development cooperation \\nlandscape in the country.  undp also provided support to the government as it drew on aims data to draft \\n\\nis to provide a detailed \\naccount of how development cooperation is allocated in nepal, promoting transparency and accountability \\nbetween the government and its development partners, as well as providing an entry point for dialogue on \\nhow to strengthen coop\\neration among stakeholders, ensuring all development resources in the country are \\nused effectively for maximum impact.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n30\\n \\nchallenges\\n \\nand\\n \\nissues\\n \\nin a diverse financing and partnership landscape and increasingly complex development challenges, there is \\nno a\\n \\ns\\ni\\nlver bullet\\n \\nfor\\n \\nways in which the effectiveness principles guide how we work better together. to improve \\nways of working, there is need for behavioral changes by governments and development stakeholders at all \\nlevels. thus, in its mission to increase th\\ne effectiveness of all forms of development cooperation, the global \\npartnership takes an approach for country\\n-\\nfocus while supporting global accountability and learning. \\n \\n \\nwithin this context, the support of undp through the global project centers on data, evidence, and knowledge \\nthat connects country\\n-\\nlevel reality of effectiveness efforts with global dialogue on effective development \\ncooperation. in an effort to deliver the\\n \\nexpected results set out by the

countries in the asia region and potentially globally, due to the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. with the emergence of con˜rmed cases of the virus in \\ntourist resorts in early march 2020, the government of maldives introduced strict containment measures which eventually \\nresulted in the suspension of on arrival visa for visitors at the end of april 2020. this meant that the maldives tourism \\nindustry would completely close for three months until july 2020 which is unprecedented in the country™s history. it is \\nestimated that these local containment measures as well as the pandemic™s impact on global travel will result in a decline \\nin tourist arrivals for the year 2020 by 50 percent or more. this negative impact on tourism is expected to lead to a \\nsigni˜cant decline in the gdp growth for the year, the loss is expected to be in the range 11 to 30 percent with substantial \\ndeclines in revenues for the government. this phase of the rapid livelihood assessment aimed to understand the impact of the complete closure of the maldives tourism industry on employment, livelihoods and the potential knock-on e˚ects \\non their families and communities. the following outlines some of the key ˜ndings of the assessment:\\nthe report is commissioned by the ministry of economic development, the government of maldives and the assessment was completed with support from undp maldives. the rapid assessment aimed to understand the extent and nature of impact of the covid-19 crisis in the maldives and support timely economic recovery planning.\\nthe ˜rst phase of the assessment explored the impact of the crisis on employment in the tourism sector. the tourism sector \\nwas targeted because it is the largest industry and employer in the country, and it was the sector that was most exposed \\nto the external shock. the data collection for this phase involved reviewing secondary data on tourism employment provided by the national bureau of statistics, analyzing secondary data extracted from the government™s online job \\nportal, jobcenter.mv and two primary data collection activities which included a phone survey with resort managers and \\nan in-depth interview by phone and other online mediums with resort employees registered in the government™s online \\njob portal. the following summarizes the preliminary ˜ndings from the ˜rst phase of the assessment. the assessment report will be updated, when remaining data collection activities are completed.approximately 22,000 local payroll employees of \\nresorts are being a˜ected as a direct result of covid-19. \\nwith the inclusion of foreign payroll employees, more \\nthan 45,000 employees in tourist resorts alone are being \\na˚ected. in addition, a large number of people working for \\nthird-party service providers of the resorts are a˚ected. a large proportion of these third-party employees of resorts are foreign migrant workers undertaking elementary work \\nsuch as gardening, cleaning and maintenance. \\nthe direct impact of the crisis on resort employees is evident in 3 ways i.e redundancy, retention but with \\nno-pay leave and retention with reduced pay.\\n the distribution of impact varied between the data sources used for the analysis in this report. the resort management \\nsurvey indicated that 16 percent of payroll employees were terminated while 84 percent were retained with reduced pay. an analysis of the data from cases lodged \\nin the government™s job center portal indicated that out of \\n724 cases, 16 percent faced termination, 49 percent were retained with no-pay and 35 percent were retained with \\nreduced pay. \\nwith respect to job security, majority of payroll \\nemployees have been retained for the period april-june 2020. job loss and redundancy was mostly \\nevident amongst those on probation contracts and amongst younger age groups. more than 55 percent of those terminated as per the cases lodged in the government™s job portal indicated that the employees \\nhad contracts less than 3 months which meant that they were either on probation or doing internships. \\nthe cases lodged in the job center also indicated that termination was highest among young people (15-20-year olds) and those working in food and beverage and transport areas. according to data collected for this assessment, a large proportion of sta˚ of third-party service providers to resorts including migrant workers \\nare likely to have been made redundant. \\njob security beyond july is uncertain for majority \\nof the resort employeess. experts forecast a slow recovery for the maldives tourism industry with occupancy levels that are unlikely to normalize until \\nthe end of the ˜rst quarter of 2021. although resorts \\npage \\n4furthermore, short term employability and income \\nopportunity within the tourism industry is uncertain for many including those in job transition. cthose in \\njob transition phase, have lost jobs, are on no pay, are \\nunemployed and seeking for new jobs and are new entrants to the labour market are amongst those are \\nunlikely to secure employment or incomes in the short \\nterm, from the tourism industry. likewise, freelance \\nservice providers and community vendors of goods and services are undergoing multiple challenges with no formal recognition and loss of income a˚ecting their livelihood and wellbeing during this period. the short-term income opportunities for freelance workers and \\nsome vendors look unpromising with low occupancy forecasts and slow growing demand in the tourism sector. \\nimpact on household and family as a result of the income loss is likely to be substantial.\\n in-depth interviews held with resort workers registered in the \\nonline job portal indicated that most would not be able to manage household expenses beyond the ˜rst month (april) and most did not have any savings. informants who had special needs children indicated several concerns. some of the coping strategies stated indicated reducing household expenses such as postponing renovation planned for their house, \\npostponing holidays, temporary relocation of family from male™ to home island due to una˚ordability of rent \\nin the greater male™ region, postponement of personal \\nloan payments. notably, the informants who had their \\nspouse working in the government/public sector \\nexpressed less anxiety and were more accepting of the situation even when they have been forced into 3 months of no-pay leave. as for positive impacts, all \\ninformants recognized time with the family specially \\nduring ramadan as a positive aspect of the crisis. \\nperceptions on potential negative impact on the \\ncommunity as a result of the income loss and relocation of employees from resorts to home \\nislands was mixed.\\n the in-depth interviews held with resort workers aimed to understand what impacts are \\nfelt at a community level as a result of the crisis and relocation of resort workers. when asked about this \\ninitially, majority of the informants did not foresee any \\nimpact or negative impact on the community. when \\ninformants were speci˜cally asked what changes the \\nin˛ux of resort workers might bring to their community, \\nthere were some concerns that many are at a vulnerable state and there could be some negative impacts to the community. however, many respondents did not believe \\nthat there could be a negative social impact such as \\nare seeking to reopen in july, it will be done with minimal \\noperations and with a skeleton sta˚ structure. a large \\nnumber of employees that are currently retained up to the end of june 2020 risk losing their jobs after july 2020 as resorts may not be able to retain them.services of freelancers, seasonal workers and local \\nvendors providing goods and services to resorts have been temporarily stopped and majority work on mutual \\nunderstanding basis, indicating a high prevalence of loss of work amongst informal sector catering the resorts. these include recreation/entertainment providers \\nto resorts, cleaning services provided to resorts which often involves women, reef ˜sh providers, local boat (dhoni) operators etc.for those employees who have been retained, a large \\nproportion of employees have lost their incomes \\ncompletely as majority are put on no-pay for the for the period april-june 2020.\\n as stated above, the data di˚ers \\nbetween the resort management survey conducted for this assessment and the data from the cases lodged in the government™s job portal. according to ˜ndings of \\nthe resort management survey, none of the payroll sta˚ \\nretained were put on no-pay, while the data from the job \\ncenter cases indicate that 49 percent were put on no-pay. \\nemployees positions who lost jobs and are on no pay will experience an average income loss ranging from us$ 600 to us$ 1,000 per month for the period april \\nœ june 2020\\n, compared to the same period last year. \\nincome loss accounts for loss in salaries and service charge earned. service charge substantially increases income in the resorts and comprise of more than 40 percent of the total monthly income earned by the resort employees. estimates show that non-managerial level payroll employees were earning an average salary of us$ 350 œ us$ 650 and an average service charge of us$ 500 per month, with variations across luxury and other segments, and variations during the peak and o˚-peak seasons.employees in non-managerial positions who received a reduced pay are likely to earn on average \\napproximately us$ 325 (mvr 5,000) per month for \\nthe period april -june 2020. \\nsome employees on reduced pay are earning as low as us$ 130 (mvr 2,000) \\nwhile some are expected to earn us$ 500 (mvr 7,710) \\nor more depending on specially designed pay packages o˚ered by the resorts during this period. thus, retained employees are expected to experience an income loss more than 60 percent of their monthly income during this period, inevitably a˚ecting their livelihood.page \\n5increase in crime rates or rise in domestic violence. some \\nrespondents noted that if those who returned to islands had a history of substance abuse, this could lead to rise \\nin drug related criminal activities. if not, they do not think there could be an increase in criminal activities. some of the concerns that could lead to community tension \\nthat were mentioned include the sense of disadvantage (some earning incomes through crisis while others have lost everything) and a large number of people idling and having nothing to do may get absorbed into existing ideological or ward clashes. few informants highlighted that elderly who receive government elderly bene˜ts may be subject to theft or maybe taken advantage of in the \\ncontext where many have lost incomes. one informant stated that, looking after the elderly could become a problem due to the home isolation caused by covid-19. \\noverall, no respondents believed there could be a rise in domestic violence, when asked about it speci˜cally. \\nhowever, many informants acknowledged that ˜nancial \\npressures and mental pressures amongst them and within the family could lead to problems in their marital relationships and tensions within the family. \\npage \\n6phase i recommendations \\npreliminary ˜ndings of the assessment provided insights and recommendations broadly for the government and for the \\nemployers in the tourism sector:establish dialogue between government and industry actors for joint development of a recovery plan for the tourism sector to mitigate any prolonged negative impacts on employment. the recovery plan should integrate new rules of operation, transparent and advance communication and enforcement of the rules, guidelines on sta˚ accommodation, movement, testing, isolation and treatment along with those for guests, establishing a national standard for resort employees on occupation health and safety in the new normal operations, etc. identify avenues for restructuring of the resort operation model in the ‚new normal™ and emerging employment opportunities within this alternative model. this includes health and safety o˝cers that would be recruited onsite/data monitoring o˝cials, business continuity planning advisors, and mental health counselors. facilitating virtual operation functions of administration, ˜nance, and other \\nback o˝ce management along with reducing employees on-site for enhanced health and safety of resort will \\ne˚ectively allow commuting to work and potentially unlock employment opportunities for those with barriers to on-site resort living and increase motivation and work-\\nlife balance. \\nimplement consistent strategies and interventions \\ntargeted at employees during the waiting period.\\n with indicated delay in resuming full operations and subsequent longer waiting period that could be faced by employees in the tourism sector beyond june 2020, psycho-social \\nsupport (pss) services, personal development and coaching services can be provided collaboratively to assist with coping strategies during the period. the government can mobilize the interested in emergency response work, \\ncommunity-based infrastructure and resilience activities \\nand temporary informal work during the period and promote alternative schemes and employment. given that majority of the a˚ected are below the age of 30, skill \\ndevelopment training through partnerships with local and international resort operators and hospitality schools can \\nbe conducted online and short-term with apprenticeship programs and other rewards as industry recovers. the waiting period can also be utilized for upskilling maldivians to qualify for jobs at middle management and upper management levels.facilitate labour governance reforms and strengthen institutional capacity and response on labour issues. this includes strengthening the monitoring capacity of labour relations authority (lra), measures to eliminate \\nengagement of undocumented foreign migrant workers \\nin the resorts through standardizing third party contracting \\nundertaken by resorts by allowing lra to certify third \\nparty service providers and recognizing that the service \\nproviders that adhere to these standards e˚ectively for potential contractors. this should focus on exclusive \\nrecruitment of legal migrant workers. other measures \\nincluding developing a voluntary charter of standards for treatment of migrant workers amongst employers \\nwith ngos and business associations. these \\nrecommendations should come as part of the broader \\npackage of reforms that are needed to address the underlying labour issues including combatting tra˝cking and legal reforms by strengthening the employment law. \\nstrengthen labour market services and support \\nsystems. it is recommended that tourism statistics regulation be revised for streamlined data collection and reporting to one single agency notably lra on a regular employment reporting related to resorts. the \\nlra should be capacitated to maintain employment statistics, harmonise employee data management, and provide accurate forecasting and planning for employment creation overall. similarly, it recommended \\nthat the online job portal services of med be expanded \\nto serve as a critical labour support service point and as \\na system for monitoring unemployment. the online job portal can also be enhanced to build awareness around contract negotiation, familiarization with employee \\nrights, career counselling, job matching services.harmonize and strengthen social protection with labour market services discussed above. \\nthe government™s income support scheme to providing \\ncash relief for those a˚ected is a step in the right direction. the current scheme was established for 3 months. the assessment shows that the impact on employment will be prolonged, therefore it is recommended that the government explores employment retention schemes jointly with resort employers for the period beyond the three months. other recommendations include establishing dialogue with insurance providers to integrate covid-19 testing, \\ntreatment, and evacuations coverage for employees. \\nas a long term measure, it is recommended that  \\ndialogues be initiated with stakeholders for potential \\nestablishment of an contingency fund for tourism employees to mitigate similar  impacts in future crises \\nand be used in contingencies and hr development in the sector. the fund can be supplemented by monthly \\ncontribution from employers and employees as a \\n‚health and social payment™ and by annual contributions from the government. page \\n7some of the recommendations for employers in the tourism sector are to improve employee management in the ‚new normal™ context when resorts reopen. the recommendations include implementing the national occupational health and safety standard for resort \\nemployees, establishing hygiene regimes for sta˚ \\naccommodation/canteen facilities, social distancing protocols between employees and employers, \\narrangements for rapid and regular testing protocols for \\nsta˚, isolation and treatment services for sta˚, exploring \\noptions for minimising on-site employees by establishing family friendly residential campuses for sta˚ in nearby islands, identifying the feasibility of virtual operations \\nfor non-tourist facing departments, ensure employees restarting operations are well trained and available, \\nexplore on the job and apprenticeship programmes \\nduring the low occupancy for laid o˚ sta˚ and unemployed youth, train employees working in guest facing areas to answer questions by visitors and \\nstrengthen trainings by partnering with public health authorities to provide latest advice and skill certi˜cates to employees prior to border opening, re-train all employees on guidelines required by the health authorities and tourism establishment, continuously monitor employees™ mental and physical wellbeing by \\nvarious layers of management and encourage to follow public health safety measures. page \\n8ministry of economic developmentboduthakurufaanu magu, male™ 20125\\nrepublic of maldives\\nphone: +960

ministry of foreign affairs of finland\\nthe world today is reeling from the devastating social and economic impacts of covid-19. the pan\\n-demic has unmasked how inequality shapes not only the experience of crisis, but also prospects for \\nresilience and recovery.\\nin fragile and con˚ict-affected countries, where populations are already suffering from multiple risks \\nposed by climate change, the pandemic is a ﬁcrisis layered on top of a crisis.ﬂ livelihoods that depend \\non reliable access to markets are undermined by disrupted supply chains, restrained mobility or mar\\n-ket closures. populations displaced by climate-related security risks living in camps or settlements \\nœ where health facilities are already inadequate œ are not afforded the luxury of social distancing. \\nin these contexts, political and economic instability undermine capacity to cope with health crises, as \\nwell as climate and environmental shocks. this traps communities in a negative downward spiral that \\ncan fuel further con˚ict and insecurity.\\nrecent research has improved our understanding of these climate-security traps. too little attention, \\nhowever, has been paid to the role of gender norms and power dynamics in shaping responses to \\nthese reinforcing crises. \\nfrom the sahel and the horn of africa to south-east asia and central america, the report shows \\nhow factors of marginalization combine to leave women and girls with a disproportionate economic \\nburden; how gendered expectations can lead men and women to resort to violence when traditional \\nlivelihoods fail; and how important socio-economic shifts can result from changes to patterns of \\nmigration.\\nthe report also makes clear that there are important opportunities for action, even as the negative \\nimpacts of climate change on security become more visible every day. its recommendations provide \\na clear way forward, encouraging us to recognize the interdependence of peace and security, human \\nrights and development.\\nfinland has a storied tradition of supporting global peace. the risks posed by climate change only \\nmake working to fully integrate these issues into con˚ict prevention and peacebuilding more urgent. \\nbut we cannot afford to do so without recognizing the unique experiences, knowledge, and capacity of \\nwomen, men, girls, and boys living on the frontlines.  \\nfinland is deeply committed to gender equality and is a strong advocate of women™s roles in con˚ict \\nprevention and peacebuilding. as support to climate action is more critical than ever, we look forward \\nto continuing to support women and men in fragile contexts, as well as the global community, to build \\nand sustain inclusive peace.\\n7climate change is now impacting every corner of the globe. in many regions, severe droughts and rising \\ntemperatures are leading to food insecurity and loss of livelihoods œ threatening to reverse hard-won \\ndevelopment gains. in fragile and con˚ict-affected settings, limited governance, political instability \\nand violence leave communities particularly ill-equipped to cope with a changing climate. this in turn \\ncan compound existing tensions and exacerbate the complex emergencies we are witnessing today \\n in the sahel, the middle east and central america. \\nas this report outlines, climate change is already resulting in risks for the security of many millions \\naround the globe. these risks disproportionately affect women and girls, who are key providers of food, \\nwater and energy, but have fewer resources with which to adapt to changing conditions. however, in \\nsome regions, the impacts of climate change are also leading to important socio-economic shifts that \\nare \\ntransforming traditional gender norms\\n around economic activity, decision-making and leadership. \\nthe report argues that such changes have the potential to open-up new spaces for more inclusive \\npeace and development processes.\\nthese gender dynamics are still relatively poorly understood at the international level œ and they \\nare generally lacking in climate-security policymaking and practice to date. this report ˜lls a gap-in-\\nknowledge and offers a comprehensive, accessible framework to demonstrate how \\ngender, climate \\nand security are inextricably linked.\\n it also highlights concrete ways to take advantage of these linkages \\nto prevent con˚ict and foster lasting peace.\\nthe united nations (un) is undertaking a range of actions to join the dots between climate change, \\ngender equality and peace and security. this report stems from an initiative of the un environment \\nprogramme (unep), un women, the un development programme (undp) and the un peacebuilding \\nsupport of˜ce (pbso) to address gender, the environment, peace and development as fundamentally \\ninterlinked issues. this \\njoint programme on women, natural resources, climate and peace\\n recognizes \\nthat interventions around natural resources, the environment and climate change provide signi˜cant \\nopportunities to empower women politically and economically, and to strengthen their contributions \\nto peace.\\nas the un system ramps up its efforts to better support countries and communities faced with the \\nmulti-faceted threats posed by our changing climate, partnerships such as these are needed more than \\never. in this crucial decade of action for the sustainable development goals, \\nour experience shows \\nthat this inclusive approach is the only way to sustain peace on the frontlines of climate change. \\nin his 2019 report on \\nwomen, peace and security,\\n the un secretary-general declared an \\nurgent need \\nfor better analysis of the linkages between climate change and con˚ict from a gender perspective. \\nwe \\nbelieve that this report answers this call.\\nspecial message\\n executive director, un environment programme\\n executive director, un women

\\nde˜ning threat to peace and security in the 21\\nst century.\\n1 its impacts have already increased the insecurity of \\nvulnerable communities in several regions across the globe, \\nexacerbating loss of livelihoods, food insecurity, competition \\nover scarce resources, human mobility and political and \\neconomic instability. in fragile and con˚ict-affected settings \\nwhere governance is limited or ineffective, the consequences \\nof climate change can interact with other political, social, \\nand economic stresses to compound existing tensions, which \\ncan undermine development gains, escalate into violence or \\ndisrupt fragile peace processes. in turn, violent con˚ict and \\npolitical instability leave communities poorer, less resilient, \\nand ill-equipped to cope with the effects of climate change. \\nthe impacts of climate change and its associated security \\nrisks have important gender dimensions that shape how \\nmen and women of different backgrounds experience \\nor contribute to insecurity. a recent study exploring the \\nlinkages between gender inequality, climate vulnerability \\nand state fragility through country-level indicators found \\nthat these factors were positively correlated with one \\nanother: countries with relatively higher values in one \\nissue area tended to have relatively higher scores in \\nthe other issue areas \\n(see box 1)\\n.2 these conclusions are \\nsupported through emerging ˜eld research and anecdotal \\nevidence collected from practitioners across the globe. in \\nmany countries, violence against women environmental \\nactivists and ﬁdefendersﬂ of environmental rights has \\nbecome a well-documented trend \\n(see box 2)\\n. recognizing \\ndifferentiated experiences can help minimize risks across \\nthe security spectrum and identify opportunities for \\nbuilding and sustaining a more inclusive peace.\\n10however, these gender dynamics are still poorly \\nunderstood at the international level and are \\ngenerally lacking in climate-security policy-making \\n and practice to date. for example, in an open \\ndebate on ﬁaddressing the impacts of climate-\\nrelated disasters on international peace and \\nsecurityﬂ held in the un security council in january \\n2019, only ˜ve out of 75 member states to take the \\n˚oor recognized gender considerations as impor\\n-tant in responding to climate-related security \\nrisks. similarly, climate-related security risks have \\nyet to be analyzed or integrated in a meaningful \\nway in efforts to implement un security council \\nresolution 1325 and the women, peace and \\nsecurity agenda. as the international commu\\n-nity accelerates policy-making, programming and \\ninvestments to address climate-related security \\nrisks in fragile contexts, this is a critical gap.\\nevidence from the ground suggests that the \\nimpacts of climate change are leading to \\nsigni˜cant socio-economic shifts, including \\ntransforming the traditional gender norms that \\ndetermine economic activity, social relationships \\nand leadership. in sudan, for example, resource \\nscarcity œ the result of con˚ict, drought, and \\nexclusionary decision-making processes œ has \\nforced some pastoralist communities to change \\ntheir migratory patterns, often leaving women \\nbehind in settled villages to manage households \\nwhile men search for grazing land. in the absence \\nof men, women take on new responsibilities, \\nincluding those traditionally carried out by men. \\nthis trend is also found in other regions of the \\nsahel, such as the lake chad basin.\\nif carefully managed, shifting social norms \\ncan create entry points for women™s economic \\nempowerment, as well as for their participa\\n-tion in decision-making, con˚ict prevention \\nand peacebuilding. on the contrary, when these \\ndynamics are ignored, new risks and vulnerabil\\n-ities can result for the women and men on the \\nfrontlines of climate change, who are coping \\nwith the impacts of the changing distribution and availability of key natural resources such as \\nfertile land, wildlife and water.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n11researchers and practitioners working in fragile \\ncontexts have repeatedly stressed that it is \\nimperative to understand and respond to the way \\ngender norms, expectations and power struc\\n-tures shape how men and women experience, \\ncontribute to and respond to climate-related \\nsecurity risks. this was acknowledged by the un \\nsecretary-general in his 2019 annual report on \\nwomen, peace and security, which states: ﬁthe \\nglobal threat of climate change and environmental \\ndegradation is poised to exacerbate the already \\nincreasing number of complex emergencies, which \\ndisproportionately affect women and girls. there \\nis therefore an urgent need for better analysis \\nand concrete, immediate actions to address the \\nlinkages between climate change and con˚ict \\nfrom a gender perspective.ﬂ\\n 3this report is an initial response to this call. it \\noffers a comprehensive framework for under\\n-standing how gender, climate and security are \\nlinked (section ii), and shares œ through a series of \\nbrief case studies œ practical examples of empirical \\nresearch, analytical approaches, and programme \\ninterventions that can contribute to respond\\n-ing to these risks (section iii). these cases are \\ncontributed by a diverse group of researchers and \\npractitioners who have experienced the risks and \\nopportunities associated with gender, climate and \\nsecurity in their own work. the report concludes \\n(section iv) with a set of recommendations to \\nguide policy-making, investments, programme \\ndesign, and research, with the aim of catalyzing \\ngender-responsive action on climate and security \\nthat ultimately contributes to inclusive and \\nsustainable peace. the report also features two \\ntypes of discussion boxes: \\ngreen boxes\\n review \\nadditional dimensions of gender, climate and \\nsecurity linkages, while \\nblue boxes\\n highlight the breadth of related research from external \\nresearchers. \\n12ﬁ\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n 4\\nsection ii  understanding gender \\n in the context of climate \\nchange and securityclimate change generates a range of risks across the \\nsecurity spectrum. in already fragile contexts, the impacts \\nof climate change can exacerbate conditions that threaten \\nsecurity, such as loss of livelihoods or competition over \\nscarce resources. at the same time, con˚ict and insecurity \\nundermine resilience to external shocks and make adapting \\nto the impacts of a changing climate more challenging. \\ngender norms, roles, responsibilities, behaviors and power \\nstructures determine how different groups of people \\nexperience and manage these risks. the understanding and \\nmeaningful consideration of these experiences can therefore \\nuncover new entry points for building and sustaining peace. \\nconversely, a gender-blind approach to addressing climate-\\nrelated security risks œ or a ﬁclimate-blindﬂ approach to \\nwomen, peace and security programming œ can exacerbate \\nthe vulnerabilities of groups most exposed to the impacts \\nof climate change, deepening existing inequalities and \\npotentially aggravating environmental and security threats. \\nthis chapter presents the key concepts explored in this \\nreport and unpacks the complex interplay of gender, climate \\nchange and security, highlighting some of the risks for peace \\nand security. it closes by identifying opportunities and entry \\npoints for designing integrated approaches to policy-making \\nand programme design in global peace and security and \\nclimate action agendas.\\n14gender\\n is understood as the social (rather than biological) attributes, norms, roles and attitudes \\nconsidered appropriate for groups of men and women by a given society at a given point in time and \\nlearned through socialization. gender shapes and reinforces power relations between and among \\nthese different groups.\\n4 this report applies an intersectional approach, which exposes the dynamics \\n that occur as gender identity interacts or overlaps with other identity markers, such as race, \\n socio-economic status, culture or ethnicity, creating multiple layers of marginalization and discrimi\\n-nation. intersectionality\\n emerged through the observation that black women experienced a double \\noppression from patriarchy and racism, which affected their access to justice compared to white \\nwomen in the united states.\\n5 in the context of environmental justice, indigenous women often face \\nmultilayered risks as they are discriminated against as environmental activists, as women and as \\npart of an ethnic minority group \\n(see box 2)\\n. considering men and women as homogenous groups can \\nreinforce harmful stereotypes that can perpetuate economic, social or political inequalities, and fail \\nto recognize the challenges of different groups faced with multiple layers of marginalization.\\nthe intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) de˜nes climate as ﬁaverage weatherﬂ or more \\nrigorously, as the ﬁstatistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities [of \\ntemperature, precipitation or wind] over a period of time ranging from months to thousands of yearsﬂ.\\n6 this report refers to impacts of climate change, understood as ﬁchange in the state of the climate \\nthat can be identi˜ed by changes in the mean and/or variability of its properties and that persists \\nfor extended periods.ﬂ\\n7 in particular, the report considers communities™ capacity to adapt to œ or even \\nprevent œ the impacts of climate change, including ecosystem degradation and resource scarcity due to \\nerratic, extreme and/or changed rainfall patterns, temperature increase and extreme weather events. \\nframed in the context of the un charter, international peace and security refers to the absence of war \\nand armed con˚ict and the peaceful settlement of disputes. it is linked to \\nstate or national security, \\nwhich refers to the requirement to protect the state through the use of economic, military and political \\npower, and the exercise of diplomacy. this report, however, is grounded in a broader understanding of \\n(in)security, recognizing that insecurity can occur at multiple levels (household, community, state, or \\ntransnational) and across multiple dimensions, including within economic, food, health, community, \\nenvironmental, personal and political spheres.\\n8 these forms of (in)security constitute the seven di\\n-mensions of the people-centered concept of \\nhuman security,\\n reinforcing the linkages between devel\\n-opment, human rights, and peace and security.\\n9\\n \\n \\n15\\n\\n \\nacross countries, gender inequality, state fragility\\n* and climate vulnerability present challenges to the well-being \\n of communities and the ecosystems upon which they \\ndepend. while much research exists connecting pairs of \\nthese issues œ for example, the need for gender-responsive \\n approaches to realize climate goals œ little attention \\nhas been devoted to the intersection of these three \\n issues, nor to how this ﬁtriple nexusﬂ could be taken into \\naccount toward more effective sustainable development \\ndecision-making and programming. \\nthe international union for conservation of nature (iucn) \\ntogether with the united states agency for international \\n development (usaid) conducted a study to explore \\nthe links among these triple nexus topics. researchers \\n developed a framework of 27 country level indicators \\n œ e.g. inheritance rights of widows and daughters (oecd), \\n government effectiveness (world bank) and low eleva\\n-tion coastal population (ciesin-columbia university) \\nœ to better understand how and where those links are \\nprevalent in 122 countries for which usaid has a country \\nor regional mission.\\n**the research has three key ˜ndings:\\n1.  \\naspects of gender inequality, state fragility and climate \\n vulnerability affect each country included in this study \\nto varying degrees, and scores in the three areas are \\npositively correlated with one another. this means that \\ncountries with relatively higher values in one issue \\narea tend to have relatively higher scores in the other \\nissue areas. \\n2.  \\nthe mapping analysis demonstrated that the triple \\nnexus issues are particularly prevalent in sub-saharan \\nafrica, the middle east and north africa.\\n3.  \\nthere are signi˜cant data gaps for gender, environ\\n-mental and fragility indicators œ especially for small \\nisland states. this points to the urgent need for invest\\n-ment in sex-disaggregated and environmental data. \\nthe issues and underlying causes of gender inequality, \\nstate fragility and climate vulnerability are highly com\\n-plex and context-speci˜c. country level indicators are \\none tool for identifying the prevalence of triple nexus \\nissues, but risk analysis must be coupled with grounded \\n research to provide context-speci˜c evidence of how \\nthese issues are impacting local communities. the study \\nreinforces the need for integrated gender-responsive \\npolicy and programmatic approaches that incorporate \\ngender, climate and state fragility considerations. in any \\nsuch actions, women and girls should be supported and \\npositioned as actors for peace and resilience.\\n* in the context of the study, ﬁfragility refers to the extent to which state-society relations fail to produce outcomes that are considered to be effective \\nand legitimate.ﬂ usaid.

supporting literature review, can be found in iucn™s \\nforthcoming publication: \\nadvancing gender in the environment: the triple nexus of gender inequality, state fragility, and climate vulnerability.\\n16\\n\\nas climate change fuels renewed waves of environmental \\nactivism, global trends show that taking action to protect \\n natural resources and defend environmental rights is be-\\n coming ever more dangerous. in 2018, 77 percent of human \\n rights defenders who were murdered (and whose deaths \\nwere recorded) were defending land, indigenous peoples™ \\n and/or environmental rights.\\n10 global witness docu\\n-mented 168 killings of land and environmental defenders \\nin 2018 and an additional 201 in 2017, about ten percent \\n of whom were women. the true scale of the problem is \\n dif˜cult to estimate but the number of those who have \\nlost their lives is likely far greater than has been recorded; \\nmany more have been silenced with intimidation, arrests, \\nviolent attacks or lawsuits.\\n11, 12an analysis of women land and environmental defenders \\nby global witness notes that women activists face speci˜c \\nand unique risks, even though the majority of recorded\\nmurders are of men.\\n13 in patriarchal societies, women \\nactivists are defending not only their environment, but \\ntheir right to speak out. as women are often excluded \\nfrom land ownership, natural resource governance and \\ndecision-making processes, this creates a context in \\nwhich women™s voice and legitimacy is challenged from \\nthe onset. in some contexts, women are subjected to \\n defamation and ﬁsmear campaignsﬂ to further delegi-\\n timize their purpose. women environmental defenders \\nalso face threats of sexual violence and rape, particularly \\nin contexts where women stand up to extractive indus\\n-tries on indigenous lands. many women also lose their \\nlives to their cause.\\n14 in 2016, the murder of famous indi-\\n genous environmental activist berta cáceres in honduras \\nsparked international attention. however, the killing of \\nmany more female activists goes largely unnoticed, and \\nunrecorded.\\n15 17\\n climate change hazards–\\n˜   droughts\\n˜   sea level rise\\n˜   extreme weather events\\n˜   warmer temperatures\\n...can expose women and men \\nto new risks or exacerbate \\nexisting challenges. \\n for example: \\n˜   water scarcity can expose \\nwomen to increased risk of \\ngender-based violence. \\n˜   faltering livelihoods can \\ncontribute to men™s decisions \\nto join armed groups.\\n˜   drought can shift pastoralist \\nmigration patterns causing \\nfamilies to split, increasing \\nhousehold burdens for \\nwomen and exposing men \\n to insecure routes.\\n...can undermine women and men™s ability to adapt, prevent, or recover from climate-related risks. \\nfor example: \\n˜   denying women resources \\nlimits households™ capacity \\nto cope with economic stress \\ncaused by agricultural shocks.\\n˜   con˚ict or violence can limit \\naccess to resources necessary \\nto cope with environmental \\nstress and exacerbate gender \\ninequalities.˜    weak or limited governance \\ncan reinforce exclusionary \\ndecision-making on land use \\nplanning and natural resource \\nmanagement.\\ntogether, \\nclimate change\\n and insecurity  create compound risks for women and men,

\\n˜   control of economic assets\\n˜   physical mobility & migration\\n˜   decision-making power\\n˜   household or community \\n expectations\\n18climate-related security risks \\n˜ \\nthe impacts of climate change compound economic, political, social and environmental pressures, \\nwhich can lead to the loss of livelihoods, increased competition over resources or displacement and \\nmigration,\\n16 as well as volatile food prices and provisions, among others.\\n17 these risks can undermine \\nrelationships, social cohesion and peace and security, as well as reverse gains made to development. \\nstates with functional institutions, diversi˜ed economies and trusting relationships with their citizens \\nare better prepared to absorb these shocks and adapt to the challenges posed by climate change. \\nin fragile or con˚ict-affected contexts, however, these shocks can overwhelm existing systems and \\nresources, eroding trust and social cohesion and potentially resulting in, contributing to, or intensi\\n-fying con˚ict.\\n18 in some parts of the sahel region, for example, the traditional livelihoods of both farmers and herd\\n-ers have been impacted by the rapid reduction in the availability of fertile land and reliable water \\nsources due to multiple factors, including longer periods of drought, unpredictable and variable \\nrainfall, inadequate land use and agricultural policies, and violent con˚ict in neighboring areas. low \\nlevels of formal education and limited economic diversity have made seeking alternative forms of \\nincome challenging, especially for the most marginalized groups. together, these stress factors have \\nspurred competition over resources in the area, undermined trust, created new patterns of migration, \\nand provoked an increase in localized violent con˚ict between different livelihood groups.\\n19 this trend \\nis particularly marked in cross-border areas, where the vulnerability of populations is exacerbated by \\nlimited access and support from central state services.\\n˜ \\ncon˚ict and other forms of crisis weaken communities™ capacities to adapt to changes in resource \\navailability which, in turn, can reinforce key drivers of con˚ict.\\n20 for example, the ongoing humani-\\n tarian crisis in the lake chad basin is among the most severe in the world, as the region suffers from \\nviolence linked to armed groups such as boko haram. the lake chad region is also deeply impacted \\nby climate change. however, in the context of ongoing con˚ict, communities are less able to adapt to \\nchanging conditions in terms of the availability and distribution of key natural resources and increased \\nfrequency of natural hazards. restrictions on movement limit opportunities for income diversi˜cation; \\nfarmers and pastoralists cannot easily move to seek alternative livelihoods during times of drought, \\nexposing them to other vulnerabilities, such as recruitment by armed groups.\\n21gender and climate-related security risks\\n˜ \\n\\nthe power dynamics and societal expectations that de˜ne roles, responsibilities, behaviors and dif\\n-ferential access to, use and ownership of resources œ such as land, livestock or other ˜nancial assets \\nœ for people with different identities help shape how people experience and manage risk in the context \\nof climate change and insecurity. \\nthis can be observed in the context of climate and con˚ict-related migration \\n(see box 3)\\n. for example, \\nexpectations to be the primary breadwinners in areas where livelihoods are dependent on increas\\n-ingly scarce access to land and water may incentivize men to migrate away from their families in \\nsearch of alternative livelihoods. the out-migration of men may create new risks and vulnerabilities \\nfor both the men who leave and the women, children and other family members who stay behind. \\neven if migration ultimately enables them to secure access to alternative resources or new liveli\\n-hoods, men who migrate away may face physical insecurity, such as passing through areas with higher \\nlevels of violence, or entering into new, unsafe working conditions. \\n19at the same time, women who remain behind in rural areas often face a double economic burden: \\nincome generation and caring for the household. to compensate for lost income, women may take on \\nnew roles, such as working in sectors that have been traditionally dominated by men while maintaining \\nincreasingly strenuous household responsibilities, such as collecting water or fuelwood, especially in \\n degraded environments where access to such resources is ever more distant. in such situations, more\\n-over, traditional and expanding responsibilities can expose women to new security risks, including \\nsexual and gender-based violence, or create additional barriers to education. increasing burdens often \\noccur within the con˜nes of discriminatory legal frameworks that exclude or marginalize women in \\nland tenure or property rights.\\n˜ \\n\\nwhen managed carefully, the changes in gender norms, behaviors and expectations that can result \\nfrom situations of crisis can provide entry points to bring traditionally marginalized groups into leader-\\n ship and decision-making positions. for example, as women take on greater levels of responsibility \\nfor livelihood production, windows of opportunity can emerge for engaging them in more leadership \\nroles, such as the governance of natural resources, or the resolution of natural resource-related \\ndisputes. in north kordofan, sudan, women in some communities have become actively involved \\nin facilitating dialogue over natural resource disputes, a role previously entirely reserved to men.\\n22this is crucial for women™s empowerment, as access to decision-making underpins women™s ability \\nto fully participate in and bene˜t from economic activity. at the same time, incorporating women™s \\nunique knowledge of natural resources œ as providers of food, water, and energy œ into climate change \\nadaptation can strengthen the design and implementation of adaptation plans. for example, a study \\nfrom south asia shows that often women have long adopted strategies to protect their livelihoods \\nfrom being destroyed by ˚ooding, such as storing their seed in high places.\\n23 moreover, capitalizing on \\nwomen™s social networks can open up alternative communication channels, and result in opportunities \\nfor new or broader dialogue. this can, in turn, highlight women™s capacities as decision-makers and \\nin˚uencers and increase their access to other political and peacebuilding processes.\\n20\\n\\nthe impacts of the current climate crisis œ including \\nrapid onset disasters like ˚ooding or hurricanes, or slow \\nonset disasters such as drought or sea level rise œ are \\nexpected to ﬁextensively change the patterns of human \\nsettlementﬂ as people move away from unfavorable \\n environmental conditions that threaten traditional \\nlivelihoods or personal security.\\n24 in 2018, 28 million \\npeople were newly internally displaced due to con˚ict \\nor disaster, including 16.1 million people displaced due \\nto storms, foods, droughts, wild˜res, landslides and ex\\n-treme temperatures.\\n25 in rural areas, changes in rainfall \\nor temperatures that threaten water supply, subsistence \\nagriculture, or other sources of income can be a driver \\nfor rural-urban migration.\\n26migration linked to changing environmental conditions \\ncan be forced or voluntary, though the two are often \\ndif˜cult to discern.\\n27 in some cases, migration can be a \\nkey adaptation strategy, allowing people to cope with \\nharsh environmental conditions. for example, temporary \\nor seasonal migration may enable people in severely \\n affected areas to cope with challenging conditions, such \\nas intense seasonal rainfalls or heat waves, open alter\\n-native sources of livelihoods, and reduce reliance on \\nlimited natural resources.\\n28in con˚ict-affected contexts, climate change impacts \\ncan exacerbate existing risks and challenges for people \\n ˚eeing to less insecure places across borders or \\nwithin their own countries.\\n29 at the same time, con˚ict \\nmay make climate-related migration more dif˜cult, in\\n-creasing the vulnerability of those left behind. already \\ndisplaced populations œ including refugees, stateless \\npeople, and the internally displaced who often reside in\\nclimate change ﬁhotspotsﬂ œ may be exposed to secondary \\ndisplacement or may be prevented from returning home \\nsafely due to climate change impacts in their home areas.\\n30 \\n this can exacerbate other drivers of con˚ict, compound \\npre-existing vulnerabilities and contribute to competi\\n-tion over depleted natural resources.\\n31 there are important gender dimensions to consider \\nboth in cases of migration linked to slow-onset events \\nand in displacement due to sudden-onset events. they \\nrange from differentiated protection issues, access to \\nservices, health impacts, the weight of existing gender \\nnorms that can expose women to additional risks, access \\nto land tenure, and labor protection.\\n32 in addition, gender \\nroles, relations, norms and expectations signi˜cantly \\n affect women™s and men™s decisions to migrate, and \\ntheir experiences of migration in the context of climate \\nchange. these may include, for example, expectations of \\nmen to be the primary breadwinner or of women to care \\nfor household members.\\n33key policy instruments have been developed and adopt\\n-ed to address human mobility in the context of climate \\nchange. these include the kampala declaration of refu\\n-gees, returnees and internally displaced persons in africa; \\n the global protection cluster; the platform for disas\\n-ter for disaster displacement; the global compact on \\nmigration; and the global compact on refugees, among \\nothers. it is critical that gender considerations are fully \\nintegrated into these frameworks and all initiatives to \\nimplement them to ensure they address the speci˜c \\nneeds and experiences of women, men, boys and girls, \\nand that they do not exacerbate existing inequalities \\nand vulnerabilities or create new ones. \\n21integrated action to respond to the gender dimensions of climate-security risks is key to minimizing \\nthreats to peace and security, including deepening socio-economic inequality and tensions over natural \\nresources access, use and control. it is also critical for maximizing opportunities for building and sus\\n-taining peace through more inclusive political and social processes and the design of effective climate \\nchange adaptation strategies. \\nentry points for integrated action exist across several global agendas and frameworks addressing gender \\nequality, peace and security, climate action and sustainable development. effective approaches include \\nmore systematically applying a climate lens in women, peace and security programming \\n(see box 4)\\n, and \\ndesigning gender-responsive climate adaptation and peacebuilding programmes in con˚ict-affected \\ncontexts. a summary of the relevant global commitments and entry points for action described in this \\nsection can be found in \\nannex 1. \\nwomen, peace and security agenda\\nin the year 2000, landmark united nations security council resolution (unscr) 1325 recognized the \\nimportance of women™s participation at all levels in the ﬁprevention, management and resolution of \\ncon˚ictﬂ.\\n34 however, two decades later, there are still signi˜cant gaps in securing full and substantial \\ncontributions from women in all aspects of peacebuilding. \\nas climate change impacts on gender roles, power relations and livelihood patterns, new entry points \\nare emerging for engaging women on the frontlines of these changes in con˚ict prevention and \\npeacebuilding. for example, in communities where resource scarcity and violent con˚ict drive men \\nto migrate in search of alternative livelihoods, women often take on roles that challenge traditional \\ngender norms, such as mediating local con˚icts or working in traditionally male-dominated economic \\nsectors. if capitalized on effectively, these shifts have the potential to overcome longstanding barriers \\nto women™s empowerment in peacebuilding processes, and help to widen peace networks, strengthen \\ndialogue and secure inclusive political, social and economic structures that center on gender equality \\nand environmental sustainability in con˚ict-affected contexts. \\nsuch interventions, however, are still under-explored in women, \\npeace and security programming and policy-making. a recent \\nanalysis of national action plans (naps) for the implementation \\nof unscr 1325 found that only 17 naps (out of 80) included \\ndirect references to climate change, including six that acknow-\\nledged climate-related risks in discussions about their country™s \\nrespective peace and security contexts and needs. however, \\nonly three naps œ all from donor countries œ included speci˜c \\ngoals and actions to address climate-related security risks \\n(see \\nbox 4)\\n.35 while awareness of the need to better understand \\nthe climate-related security risks from a gender perspective \\nis growing (as evidenced by the un secretary-general™s 2019 \\nannual report on women, peace and security), more attention \\nneeds to be paid to programming opportunities, especially as \\ninvestments in climate-related peacebuilding programming \\nramp up.\\nentry points for integrated action\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n

potential to be an im\\n-portant tool for promoting women™s participation in \\n addressing climate change and related security risks. \\nresearch by elizabeth seymour smith (forthcoming) of \\nthe stockholm international peace research institute \\n(sipri) assesses how climate change is framed in wps \\nnaps and explores how goals and actions addressing \\nclimate change and related security risks are associated \\nwith the four ﬁpillarsﬂ of the wps agenda š prevention, \\nparticipation, protection and relief and recovery.\\n36the analysis ˜nds that 17 of 80 states with naps publicly \\navailable in english include direct mentions of climate \\nchange in their plans, framed in various ways. for ex\\n-ample, several naps integrate climate change language \\nthrough reference to unscr resolution 2242 œ the eighth \\nresolution in the wps agenda œ the ˜rst to include direct \\nmention of climate change. some plans acknowledge \\nclimate change as a factor in˚uencing instability or hu\\n-man insecurity for women in different country contexts. \\na number of these naps include actions addressing \\nchallenges relating to the environment, notably natural \\n disasters. in most of the naps reviewed however, direct \\nreferences to climate change occur in narrative and \\nbackground information sections only.\\ndifferent iterations of naps in three donor countries œ \\nfinland, ireland and the united states œ stand out as \\nexceptions, in that they feature speci˜c activities and \\ngoals that address climate change and related security \\n risks framed as part of the prevention pillar. for example, \\n finland™s most recent nap (2018-2021) includes exploring \\nopportunities and challenges associated with climate \\nchange as a key entry point for strengthening women™s \\n economic and political empowerment.\\n37 ireland™s nap \\n(2019-2024) advocates for increased investment in ad\\n-dressing the gender and security impacts associated \\nwith climate change as part of its prevention efforts, \\nsuch as through supporting research in vulnerable \\nstates to strengthen engagement with the security \\ncouncil.\\n38 the united states™ second nap (2016-2018) \\npromotes improved gender integration in work to in\\n-crease resilience to con˚ict and insecurity, including in \\ncontexts affected by climate change.\\n39 naps in all three \\ncountries also advocate for women™s participation in \\n climate change action and negotiations as part of relief \\nand recovery efforts (in the case of the united states) or \\ncon˚ict prevention initiatives (ireland and finland).\\n23sustaining peace agenda\\nthe un sustaining peace agenda emerged from the 2016 general assembly and security council ﬁtwinﬂ \\nresolutions œ a/res/70/262 and s/res/2282 œ expanding the scope of peacebuilding to emphasize \\nthe importance of con˚ict prevention at all phases of a con˚ict cycle. this approach to peacebuilding \\nprovides a unique opportunity to address the gender dimensions of climate-related security risks. \\nfirst, the sustaining peace agenda reaf˜rms unscr 1325 and recognizes the meaningful inclusion of \\nwomen as critical to con˚ict prevention and peacebuilding. speci˜cally, the twin resolutions underscore \\nﬁthe importance of women™s leadership and participation in con˚ict prevention, resolution and peace\\n-building.ﬂ\\n40 to advance women™s full participation in peacebuilding, sustaining peace initiatives should \\npromote ﬁthe gender dimensions of peacebuilding, including through the delivery of gender-sensitive \\n and targeted programming, through the strengthening of women™s meaningful participation in peace-\\n building, supporting women™s organizations and through monitoring, tracking and reporting achievement.ﬂ\\n41second, the sustaining peace agenda emphasizes ﬁthe importance of a comprehensive approach to \\nsustaining peace, particularly through the prevention of con˚ict and addressing its root causes.ﬂ\\n42 the impacts of climate change are increasingly recognized as a potential factor of con˚ict, in com\\n-bination with other socio-economic or political factors. the joint united nations and world bank \\nstudy on con˚ict prevention, \\npathways for peace: inclusive approaches to preventing violent con˜ict, \\nreaf˜rmed climate change as an important con˚ict driver, noting that while climate change alone does \\nnot cause con˚ict, ﬁrisks associated with climate change can combine with and exacerbate risks of \\nviolence through factors such as food insecurity, economic shocks and migration.ﬂ\\n43 the un secretary-\\ngeneral has also put environmental degradation and climate change at the heart of the un™s prevention \\nagenda.\\n44while the sustaining peace agenda recognizes both climate action and the inclusion of women as \\ncore elements of con˚ict prevention, the linkages between the two goals are not yet explicitly de˜ned. \\ndesigning policies and programmes that meaningfully engage women in assessing and addressing the \\ngender-differentiated risks and opportunities of climate change impacts in fragile contexts can contri-\\n bute to better addressing the root causes of con˚ict and promoting more inclusive, peaceful societies. \\n24united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc)\\nthe unfccc, aimed at ﬁpreventing ‚dangerous™ human interference with the climate system,ﬂ was \\nadopted at the rio earth summit in 1992. the implementation of the unfccc and other subsequent \\ncommitments agreed upon by the parties, including the kyoto protocol (1997) and the paris agreement \\n(2015), is overseen by the unfccc secretariat.\\n45 the framework convention ﬁputs the onus on developed \\ncountries to lead the wayﬂ in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. \\nin addition to climate change mitigation, the framework convention recognizes the importance of \\nclimate adaptation for peace and development, especially in ﬁdevelopingﬂ countries, which have con\\n-tributed the least to greenhouse gas emissions but are hit hardest by climate change impacts, and \\nhave the fewest resources available to respond to climate change shocks.\\n46 in fragile contexts, effective \\nclimate change adaptation programmes to help ﬁcountries anticipate the adverse effects of climate \\nchange and take action to prevent, minimize and respond to its potential impactsﬂ have been recognized \\nas important approaches to strengthening the resilience of states.\\n47 building effective adaptation strategies to climate change demands the knowledge and experience of \\nthose experiencing its impacts most directly. as the primary providers of food, water and energy in \\nrural areas, women are often living on the frontlines of climate change and have distinct knowledge \\nand experience to contribute to building effective adaptation strategies. however, despite growing \\nawareness and recognition that women are important actors and in˚uencers in climate change policy, \\nthey remain largely underrepresented in decision-making and planning processes, especially at local \\nlevels, which can further exacerbate existing patterns of marginalization. \\nsome important steps have been taken to recognize the gender-differentiated impacts of climate \\nchange and promote the inclusion of women. for instance, in 2014, parties to the convention agreed \\nto the lima work programme on gender, a programme designed to enhance the implementation of \\nthe existing gender provisions in climate change agreements, identify gaps, and monitor implemen\\n-tation.48 in 2017, parties adopted the ˜rst gender action plan (gap) under the lima work programme \\nto promote the inclusion of women in climate change policy-making and design gender responsive \\napproaches to climate action.\\n49 at cop 25, parties adopted a new ˜ve year gap, building on the previous \\nplan.50 gender-responsive action has also been recognized as an important element of disaster risk \\nreduction, including in the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction (2015-2030).\\nhowever, gender-responsive climate action often remains disconnected from peacebuilding and con˚ict \\nprevention initiatives. recognizing the linkages between con˚ict prevention and climate adaptation can \\nhelp create policies and interventions that mutually reinforce one another. on the contrary, failing to \\nconsider the security implications of climate change and related policies can lead to negative outcomes \\nfor peace, climate change adaptation and gender equality.\\n252030 agenda for sustainable development\\nthe 2030 agenda for sustainable development, adopted by world lea-\\nders in 2015, is a comprehensive ﬁplan of action for people, planet and \\nprosperity.ﬂ the agenda includes 17 sustainable development goals \\n(sdgs) and 169 targets that integrate economic, social, and environmental \\ndimensions to eradicate poverty, strengthen universal peace, and secure \\na resilient future. addressing the gender dimensions of climate-related \\nsecurity

centered on greater integration and collective deli-\\nvery. among other measures, the reform has introduced the united nations sustainable development \\ncooperation framework (unsdcf) (formerly the undaf or united nations development assistance \\nframework) as the main strategic instrument to respond to national needs and priorities. in order to \\npromote integration and collaboration, the elaboration of the unsdcf is underpinned by united nations \\ncommon country assessments (un ccas), carried out as an inclusive multi-stakeholder process to assess \\ngaps, opportunities, and strategic direction at the country level. gender mainstreaming and sustainable \\ndevelopment are core guiding principles for un ccas. \\nthe 2030 agenda œ and the reform of the un development system designed to support countries achieve \\nthe sdgs œ has enshrined integrated action and partnerships as core conditions for tackling com\\n-plex multi-dimensional challenges and achieving sustainable peace and development. assessing and \\naddressing the gender dimensions of climate-related security risks œ starting with conducting integrated \\nanalysis to inform un ccas œ is an important step in delivering on key inter-related objectives. \\nsection iii evidence of gender, climate \\n and security linkages \\n in research and practice\\nthis chapter seeks to illustrate the intersectional gender \\n dimensions of climate-related security risks and opportunities \\n through examples from ˜eld-based research and programming \\nexperience. these examples have been contributed by a \\ndiverse range of researchers and practitioners working in \\ncontexts affected by the impacts of climate change and other \\n compounding crises. the following case studies are brief \\nsummaries

years. at the same time, \\nchanging climate œ manifested in an increase in \\ntemperature and the unpredictability of rainfall \\nœ has signi˜cantly affected the predominantly \\nagrarian populations across the region. two \\nrecent case studies based on empirical research \\nexamining the interaction of gender, climate \\nchange and security in the middle belt region \\nand in northeastern nigeria have shown that not \\nonly are gender roles impacted by this combina\\n-tion of dynamics, but that norms of masculinity and femininity have also driven violence.\\ninter-communal violence in the middle belt region \\nis generally considered to be caused by farmer-\\n pastoralist con˚ict. factors including population \\ngrowth, allocation of grazing land to farmers, and \\nincreasing identity-based politics have altered \\npreviously largely positive interactions against a \\nbackdrop of changing climate. the unpredicta\\n-bility of rainfall has affected farming, pasture and \\nwater sources and made livelihoods more pre\\n-carious. reduced ability to absorb shocks, such \\nas the destruction of crops or the death of cattle, \\nhas increased the stakes in confrontations. this \\nviolence has, in turn, contributed to a change in \\nmigration modalities, whereby young men are \\nincreasingly moving alone with their cattle, leaving \\nfamilies behind for their safety. \\nmasculinities, the desire to protect family wealth \\ntied up in cattle, the intense stress experienced \\nby these young men and the lack of family sup\\n-port, intensify con˚ict \\ndynamics. the violence \\nitself also has gendered \\ndimensions, with the \\ncrisis point often being \\ncon˚ict between young \\nmale pastoralists and \\nwomen in farming com\\n-munities. con˚ict sites include farmlands, which \\nwomen farmers report pastoralists are more \\nlikely to encroach on if a woman is present, as \\nwell as water points, when women go to fetch \\nwater at the same time cattle is watered. rape \\nis perpetrated by both farmer and pastoralist \\nmen. attacks, including sexual violence, against \\nwomen heighten con˚ict as norms of protective \\nmasculinity impel men to retaliate when ﬁtheir \\nwomenﬂ have been attacked. \\nnortheast nigeria, for its part, has been the \\ntheater of contestation between armed opposition \\ngroups (aogs, commonly known as boko haram) \\nand the state for the past decade. land that is \\nboth secure and fertile is insuf˜cient for all popu\\n-lations to pursue livelihoods, resulting in areas of \\nhigher population density and reduced resilience \\nto variations in climate. communities are also \\nexperiencing increasing tensions and degrading \\nsocial cohesion, relationships and networks. \\nyoung men, recruited into and forced to join aogs \\n and community militias, are often stigmatized and \\nfeared as perpetrators of violence. conversely \\nwomen, often seen as innocent victims, can choose \\nto join aogs to escape the patriarchal norms of \\nmainstream society, particularly given the lack \\nof alternative livelihood options. at the same \\ntime, with many men detained, killed, ˜ghting or \\nhaving left them behind in search of work else-\\n where, women are ˜nding ways to provide for their \\nfamilies in sharp contrast to pre-existing gender \\nnorms of breadwinner masculinity. however, this \\nincreased resilience is far from uniform, as par\\n-ticular groups of women, such as women with \\ndisabilities, face intersecting forms of marginali\\n-zation, lesser access to capital and reduced social \\nnetworks due to stigma.\\nthe research shows how gender norms play signi˜-\\n cant roles in driving violence and communities™ \\nresilience to climate change. the combination of \\nclimate change and insecurity has both changed \\ngender norms and had differential impacts based \\non age, gender, disability, ethnic and religious \\nbackground and other identity markers. much \\nof this analysis of political, economic and social \\ndynamics tends to be missing from government \\npolicy and programming interventions, with cor\\n-responding reduced effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n29for decades, chadian populations have faced \\nrecurring droughts and severe food shortages, \\npolitico-military instability and subsequent \\npopulation displacements, as well as rising \\nfood prices. climate change, including increas\\n-ing droughts, extreme rainfall and ˚ooding, has \\nampli˜ed cascading threats to people™s security \\nby exacerbating livelihood and food insecurity. \\nthis has increased competition over limited \\nland and water resources and led to outbreaks \\nof violence, as well as the risk of social tensions \\nand recruitment into armed groups, particularly \\nin the lake chad region. this context has aggra\\n-vated the risk of violence against women and \\nadolescent girls, particularly in areas where basic \\nservices are lacking or non-existent, where social \\ndevelopment policies are seldom implemented \\nand where customary laws clash with the rights \\nof children and women. \\nempirical evidence collected as part of the \\nbuilding resilience and adaptation to climate \\nextremes and disasters (braced) programme, in \\ncollaboration with oxfam intermón and concern \\nworldwide, shows that at least a third of women \\nand adolescent girls in chad face severe viola\\n-tions of their rights and violence on a daily basis. \\nexperiences of child, early and forced marriage, \\ndenial of access and control over resources, evic\\n-tion of one™s home and sexual violence within \\ntheir household, are all examples of violence \\nagainst women and girls that impact negatively \\non the ability of survivors to secure their liveli\\n-hoods, their health and their rights. ﬁeveryday violenceﬂ against women and girls cre\\n-ates a negative cycle, undermining households™ \\nand communities™ capacities to adapt to environ-\\n mental changes which œ in turn œ reinforces gender-\\n based violence and discriminatory practices. for \\nexample, the practice of denying women™s access \\nto and control over resources creates economic \\nstress for the entire family. economic insecurity \\nmeans families are less able to keep their chil\\n-dren in school, making adolescent girls more \\n vulnerable to early marriage and young men more \\nvulnerable to being enlisted in armed groups, \\nand driving male migration within and outside \\nof chad. the consequences are detrimental for \\nresilience capacities, reinforcing women™s lack of \\nsafety and undermining social cohesion in com\\n-munities of origin. women and girls are often the target recipients of \\nhumanitarian aid and development projects that \\naim to increase their economic resources, but \\nthe factors that sustain their exclusion, tolerate \\ndiscriminatory norms and prevent their involve\\n-ment in decision-making are rarely or only par\\n-tially addressed. ultimately, programmes intend\\n-ing to improve people™s resilience to climate risks \\nand disasters must address the causes and the \\nimpacts of violence against women and girls, par\\n-ticularly if they aim at building peace and security. \\ninterventions that support adolescents™ access \\nto sexual and reproductive healthcare, maternal \\nhealthcare, education and information about their \\nrights constitute priority entry points in chad. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nœœ\\n\\n2. everyday violence and its impact \\n  \\n303. \\n \\n perspectives \\n\\npastoral livestock production has long been an \\nimportant livelihood in africa™s drylands, allowing \\n nomadic communities to adapt to challenging \\n climatic conditions characterized by long periods \\n of drought and highly variable rainfall. in north \\nkordofan state, sudan, however, established \\nmigratory routes and pastoralist grazing land \\nhave come under threat in recent years as a \\nresult of environmental and climactic changes, \\nthe expansion of mechanized agriculture, and \\ncon˚ict and insecurity. \\nresearch documenting these changes in and \\naround al rahad œ a locality situated along north \\nkordofan™s southeastern border that acts as a \\nmajor crossroads for several pastoralist groups œ \\nhas found that pastoralist communities are shifting \\ntheir traditional migratory patterns in different \\nways to adapt to new conditions. among the three \\npreva\\n lent ethnic groups œ the baggara, shanabla, \\nand kababish œ two distinct migratory patterns \\nhave emerged: some groups are no longer migra\\n-ting at all or are moving much smaller distances, \\nessentially settling in villages around al rahad. \\nother groups are continuing to migrate but have \\nadjusted their traditional routes to the new envi\\n-ronmental and security challenges, by avoiding \\nmigration to deterio\\n-rating grazing lands \\nin the north or send\\n-ing only men to graze \\nlarge animals in south \\nkordofan, an area with \\n higher levels of in\\n se-curity. although the \\nresearch recorded a \\ndiversity of experi\\n-ences, it highlighted \\na common trend: more pastoralist women and \\ngirls are remaining in villages throughout the \\nyear, while men and boys continue to be œ at least \\nseasonally œ mobile. this new practice has an \\nimpact on the social composition of local villages, \\nresulting in increasingly ﬁfeminizedﬂ communities. \\nshifts in livelihood practices and the social com\\n-position of villages have important implications \\nfor gender norms, as well as for social, political, \\nand economic dynamics. the research found that \\nthese changes are associated with new risks and \\nvulnerabilities for both pastoral men and pastoral \\nwomen. for example, the region is experiencing \\nincreasing levels of con˚ict between pastoralist \\ngroups and farming communities over access to \\nland or other natural resources. men and boys who \\ncontinue to migrate move through highly insecure \\nareas and are at risk of experiencing violence, as \\nwell as fueling new tensions with local farming \\ncommunities to access grazing land. women who \\nremain behind in al rahad™s villages are faced with \\nheavy burdens to ful˜l their traditional responsi\\n-bilities and as well to meet new demands, such as \\ngenerating new forms of income for the family in \\nthe absence of men. \\nat the same time, the research underscores oppor\\n-tunities for empowering women and promo\\n ting positive peace as livelihood and settlement \\npatterns shift. study participants noted that close \\nproximity to health centres, highways and a more \\nsettled lifestyle had made receiving health care œ \\nespecially reproductive healthcare œ more acces\\n-sible to pastoralist women. a more settled lifestyle \\nwas also said to allow for more frequent inter\\n-actions œ and relationship-building œ between \\nwomen from pastoral and farming communities, \\nsuch as at markets or health centres, opening up \\nnew opportunities to strengthen social cohesion \\nbetween groups. some pastoral women also noted \\nthat exposure to settled communities may be \\nhaving a positive impact on marriage practices, \\nciting that women were increasingly consulted \\nbefore marriage.\\nwhile providing a rare glimpse into the lives and \\nlivelihoods of pastoralist women on the frontlines \\nof climate change, the study™s ˜ndings reinforce that \\npastoralist experiences are dynamic and complex, \\n and are often informed by multiple identities, in\\n-cluding gender, ethnicity, economic or social status, \\nmigratory patterns and culture, among others. \\n\\n\\n œ\\nœ  \\n\\n\\n314.\\n\\n \\nan increasingly complex and nuanced under\\n-standing of the interplay between the livelihood \\nimpacts of climate change, con˚ict and security \\nis emerging for the sahel, a region known as \\nﬁground zeroﬂ for climate change. less well docu-\\nmented to date is the degree to which climate \\nchange and insecurity are contributing to impor\\n-tant social shifts, particularly in the composition \\nof rural communities. this includes a marked \\nfeminization of the resident population of some \\nlocal communities that are on the frontlines of \\nthese dynamics. while increasing the economic \\nburden on women from all social groups, and \\nexposing them to further risks of violence, these \\nshifts also provide opportunities to strengthen \\nwomen™s leadership for con˚ict prevention and \\nresolution, and to empower them to increase \\ncommunity resilience.\\na pilot project undertaken by unep, un women \\nand undp provided important insights into \\nthese dynamics in the locality of al rahad in the \\nsudanese state of north kordofan œ a commu\\n-nity, like many in the sahel, beset by climate-\\n related environmental degradation and increasing \\ncon˚icts over natural resources, as well as spill-\\nover insecurity linked to the protracted con˚ict \\non the border with south sudan. the project \\nundertook targeted interventions to support \\nwomen from all groups to exercise

con˚icts. \\nremarkably, it succeeded not only in increasing \\nwomen™s participation in natural resource gover-\\n nance, con˚ict prevention and resolution, but \\nalso in shifting perceptions of women™s leader\\n-ship, capacities and contributions in building a \\nsustainable peace.\\nthe project demonstrated that natural resource \\ngovernance and management interventions are \\na strong entry point for women™s empowerment \\nin peacebuilding. in situations where women are \\ntypically excluded from decision-making, natural \\nresources can provide a ﬁneutralﬂ entry point for \\nengaging in political dialogue and mediation of \\ncon˚icts, as women typically derive legitimacy \\nfrom their traditional resource-related roles \\nthat is not conferred to them on other issues. \\nsustainable natural resource management also \\nrepresents a key opportunity for women™s eco\\n-nomic empowerment in a context where sustain\\n-able alternative livelihoods are needed due to \\nthe impacts of a changing climate. speci˜cally \\ntargeting women in the development of climate \\nadaptive livelihoods œ and supporting them to \\norganize economically œ ensures not only income \\ngains for women, but the resilience and stability \\nof entire communities. finally, natural resource \\ninterventions can provide important platforms \\nfor cooperation for women from opposing groups \\nthat contribute to strengthening social cohesion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n32egypt™s rapid population growth and extreme \\nwater scarcity make the country highly vulnera\\n-ble to the impacts of climate change. the coun\\n-try™s long mediterranean coastline is already \\nexperiencing the consequences of sea level rise, \\nincluding saltwater intrusion, soil salinization \\nand deterioration of crop quality. in a country \\nwhere 95 percent of freshwater resources are \\ngenerated outside its territory, any change to \\nwater availability can have major consequences \\nfor food and energy security, as well as employ\\n-ment, housing, sanitation, education and health care, heightening risks of social tension and \\npolitical instability.\\nthis situation constitutes a particularly serious \\nthreat for women, who are marginalized in eco\\n-nomic, social and political spheres. one third of \\nadult women in egypt are estimated to be illi-\\n terate, as compared to 15 percent of adult men, \\nseverely limiting their opportunities for employ\\n-ment. agriculture employs 45 per cent of all \\nwomen in the labor force in egypt, but women \\nonly own 5.2 percent of the land. women also face \\n high levels of sexual and gender-based violence, \\n especially in the most impoverished urban \\nneighborhoods. unequal inheritance rights and \\ncustomary practices that discriminate against \\nwomen contribute to limited asset ownership, \\nmore unstable earnings and higher food and \\nwater insecurity. \\npolicy responses to the climate crisis in egypt have \\nso far concerned environmentalists and gender \\nequality advocates alike. as the rural population \\ngrows, land is being fragmented into increasingly \\nsmaller plots, a pattern that hinders the organi-\\n zation and ef˜cient use of farm resources and \\nexacerbates socio-economic strains. given their \\nmarginalized situation, women are particularly \\naffected by these compounding factors. this is \\nstarkly illustrated in the case of the salam canal \\nœ egypt™s largest land reclamation and irriga\\n-tion project œ which involved the construction \\nof irrigation and drainage infrastructure, land \\npreparation for farming and the development of \\nsettler villages, which often resulted in violent \\nclashes with existing populations. the settlers \\nwere selected through a formalized application \\nprocess, but while a quota of at least 20 percent \\nfemale settlers was mandated, only a handful of \\nfemale applicants were identi˜ed. many women \\nlater reported ceding control over land to male \\nfamily members, in conformity with gendered \\nroles and expectations. \\nrecognizing the co-bene˜ts of women™s empower-\\n ment and climate resilience, and supporting \\n synergistic action to realize them, constitutes an \\nimportant avenue for sustaining peace in egypt. \\nin al-zarayeb, for example, a neighborhood of \\ninformal settlements on the outskirts of cairo™s \\nmokattam hills, community-based organizations \\nlike the association for the protection of the \\nenvironment (ape) have taken action to simulta\\n-neously empower women and respond to the envi\\n-ronmental crisis. at the time of writing, the ape is \\nworking with 250 women members who count on \\neach other for protection and receive assistance \\nsecuring an environmentally-friendly source of \\nincome, education œ mostly basic literacy classes \\nœ and daycare support for their children.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n5. \\n\\n\\n336. \\n\\n\\ngovernance \\n\\n\\nin freetown, sierra leone œ a city located between \\nmountains and the atlantic coast œ rapid urbani-\\n zation, combined with poor city planning and \\nan unforgiving topography, has resulted in the \\nexpansion of informal settlements into ˚ood \\nplains and up steep hillsides. at the same time, \\nunabated deforestation and solid waste cover \\nhave signi˜cantly reduced the absorption of hea-\\n vier, harsher rains and rising sea levels, resulting \\nin an intensi˜cation of ˚ooding and landslides. \\nresidents of informal settlements, who live in \\nthe most exposed areas and possess the fewest \\nresources to adapt or respond to new condi\\n-tions, are extremely vulnerable to these disasters. \\nwomen are even further disadvantaged, as dis\\n-criminatory norms and power structures dispro\\n-portionately limit their access to social, economic \\nand political structures. in 2019, women had fewer \\nthan three years of schooling on average and held \\nonly 12 percent of parliamentary seats, according \\nto the women, peace and security index. \\nyet ˜ndings reveal that despite the gender gap, \\nwomen in freetown are carving paths to inclu\\n-sion in local governance across two key modes \\nof engagement, through which they are building \\nresilience to climate-related security risks in the \\ncity™s most vulnerable corners. first, women are \\nseeking formal representation in city govern\\n-ment. in 2018, yvonne aki-sawyerr became the \\n˜rst woman elected as mayor in 40 years œ serving \\nas one of only three women local council heads \\nnationally (out of 22). climate change and envi\\n-ronment have been at the center of her transform \\nfreetown policy agenda. her data-driven and \\nparticipatory approach to governance œ setting \\nand measuring clear environmental targets and \\nholding regular consultations with city residents, \\nincluding in informal settlements œ have helped \\nher to gain legitimacy with city residents. \\nsecond, women are engaged in community-based \\norganizations and civil society networks, espe\\n-cially in informal settlements. the federation \\nfor urban and rural poor (fedurp), a women-led \\nnetwork of more than 3,000 people, is organized \\nthrough small savings and loans groups. saving \\nand loans groups serve two core functions: they \\nprovide households with ˜nancial security and \\nthey mobilize community action. once involved in \\na savings group, network members take on other \\ntasks such as carrying out data collection in their \\ncommunities œ which helps identify risk exposure \\nœ or training community members on ˚ood and \\ndisaster management. fedurp has become an \\nimportant partner in the implementation of the \\ntransform freetown agenda, demonstrating the \\npower for inclusive governance. \\ngender-responsive development projects in infor\\n-mal settlements are making important contribu\\n-tions to supporting the empowerment of women \\nin local decision-making processes and bridging \\nthe gap between informal and formal structures \\nof governance. the ﬁpull slum pan pipulﬂ project \\nfor example (in english, ﬁtake the slum from the \\npeopleﬂ), aims to improve the well-being of resi-\\n dents of informal settlements. testimonies from \\nbene˜ciaries suggest that project interventions \\nthat have improved the livelihoods of women \\nin slums in turn have enabled women to engage \\nin decision-making processes in their homes \\nand communities, including related to disaster \\nrisk management. this project and others have \\nalso supported sustained dialogue between \\n community-based leaders and city government \\nof˜cials, setting the foundation for inclusive \\nlocal governance structures.\\nsystematic evidence of the impacts of the above-\\n mentioned initiatives for increasing resilience to \\nclimate-related security risks has not yet been \\nmeasured. however, ˜ndings demonstrate that \\nthat even in post-con˚ict societies where women \\ncontinue to face highly discriminatory norms, \\nclimate change and environmental issues can \\nprovide an important entry point for engaging \\nwomen in local governance at different levels. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n347. \\n \\nand response \\nthe asia paci˜c is a highly diverse region politi\\n-cally, economically, socio-culturally and environ\\n-mentally. this diversity ampli˜es the challenges \\nof addressing climate-related risks in a histori\\n-cally ﬁcrisis-proneﬂ region, especially as the asia \\npaci˜c lags in meeting sustainable development \\ngoals (sdg) targets in key areas of climate action, \\nnatural resource management and environmental \\nprotection. \\ndrawing on evidence from key-informant inter\\n-views and focus group discussions in three coun\\n-tries in the region œ the philippines, cambodia and \\nvanuatu œ recent research ˜nds that ﬁgender-liteﬂ \\napproaches within climate change and disaster \\n programming weaken the transformative poten\\n-tial of integrating gender perspectives across \\nrisk mapping, analysis and response. in the dis\\n-tinct security context of the asia-paci˜c, climate \\nchange is one of several interrelated ﬁeverydayﬂ \\ninsecurities, along with pre-existing gender ine\\n-qualities and compounded risks from poverty, \\nprotracted con˚icts, land dispossession and local \\nor community-level resource disputes. \\nall three countries have promulgated frame\\n-works that incorporate gender equality goals \\nwithin national climate change and disaster risk \\n reduction agendas. yet, the transformative poten\\n-tial of gender analysis and mainstreaming com\\n-mitments is largely undermined by ﬁbox-tickingﬂ \\n approaches. dominant national and global climate \\nrisk analyses remain partial œ or worse, ˚awed \\nœ because they are ultimately unable to compre\\n-hensively respond to where, when, how and what \\nmultiple risks overlap. \\nthe ˜ndings make a strong case for urgently mo-\\n ving beyond ﬁgender-liteﬂ to gender-responsive \\nimplementation across climate risk mapping and \\nresponse. a key step is to begin re-assessing \\nexisting national

inter\\n-secting environmental, social, and political cri\\n-ses, within the context of a movement seeking \\nself-determination. these ongoing crises are \\nexacerbated by longstanding grievances over \\nthe grasberg mine (which contains signi˜cant \\nreserves of copper and gold), and environmental \\ndegradation caused by the mining and palm oil \\nsectors, as well as the legacy of colonialism on \\nthe allocation of land and resources. \\nthese challenges are compounded by the \\nimpacts of changing weather patterns, which \\nhave put additional stress on the region™s rap\\n-idly depleting natural resource base, contribut\\n-ing to the loss of livelihoods and food security \\nchallenges. this has created a new dependency \\non imported foods, rapidly replacing traditional \\nsubsistence living. additionally, unusually heavy \\nrainfalls frequently cause ˚oods and landslides. \\nsuch disasters have killed many, left entire com\\n-munities displaced and severely damaged food \\ncrops.\\nindigenous papuan women, whose traditional \\nroles include providing food for their families \\nthrough small plot agriculture and forest man\\n-agement, have been disproportionately affected \\nby the impacts of environmental degradation, \\nexacerbated by a changing climate. this has com\\n-pounded other vulnerabilities linked to insecu\\n-rity, including rampant sexual and gender-based \\nviolence and marginalization, especially among \\ndisplaced populations. \\nwhile papuan women play a key role in caring for \\nthe community™s food gardens and forests, they \\npossess no rights of ownership to the land and \\nnatural resources within traditional structures. \\nwhen these lands are lost, by force or when they \\nare sold by male family members to extractive \\nindustries, whole communities are displaced. \\nthis has a profound impact on indigenous \\nwomen, whose native lands are deeply embed\\n-ded in their cultural and ethnic identity, and who \\nare dependent on access to land to carry out \\ntheir prescribed roles. displacement also puts \\nwomen at further risk of violence. \\ndespite the emerging recognition of the sub\\n-stantial link between climate change and the \\nwomen, peace and security (wps) framework, \\nthe intersections of climate change, environmen\\n-tal degradation, resource extraction, con˚ict and \\nviolence against women remain largely absent \\nfrom the security council™s agenda. the papuan \\nexperience shows how the exploitation of natu\\n-ral resources can drive violence, and how climate \\nchange can compound insecurity, leading to \\nsevere livelihood impacts on indigenous women \\nthat have trickle-down impacts on families and \\ncommunities. twenty years after the adoption of \\nunscr 1325, it is critical that the gender dimen\\n-sions of environmental degradation, resource \\nextraction, indigenous land rights and climate \\nchange, be fully integrated into the wps agenda.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n36due to its geography, pakistan is exceptionally \\nexposed to climate-related hazards, and has \\nexperienced an increasing number of climate-\\n related disasters over the last decades, inclu-\\n ding severe ˚oods and droughts which have had \\nlasting impacts on infrastructure, livelihoods \\nand resilience, particularly in urban areas. the \\nmost vulnerable, who rely on natural resources \\nand informal work, are trapped in a cycle of eco\\n-nomic, social and political marginalization that is exacerbated with every disaster. \\npakistan™s deeply embedded patriarchal norms œ \\nat all levels of society and institutions œ in˚uence \\nhow men and women perceive and experience \\nclimate change impacts within the current secu\\n-rity landscape. findings from \\nresearch across two provinces \\nœ sindh and punjab œ point \\nto some important trends \\nin urban areas. pakistan is \\nurbanizing at a rapid rate, but \\ndecent livelihood opportuni\\n-ties and public services are \\nnot following suit, with the \\nresult that life in the city is often precarious on \\nmany fronts. the impacts of climate change are \\nexacerbating this precarity and contributing to \\ndomestic violence and the formation of non-state \\narmed groups. \\nthe research ˜nds that ˜rst, men and women are \\nincreasingly unable to live up to their prescribed \\ngender roles which, in some cases, is resulting \\nin domestic or communal violence. for example, \\ndamages incurred from extreme ˚ooding have \\nbeen found to keep men œ who are typically daily \\nwage or contract workers œ at home, resulting in \\nloss of income and preventing them from ful˜l-\\n ling their prescribed roles as breadwinners. both \\nwomen and men explained that the anxieties \\nand frustrations associated with this lack of ful\\n-˜lment of their socialized responsibilities could \\nlead to domestic violence. \\nsecond, women illustrated that they faced \\nincreased structural oppression as a result \\nof certain aspects of climate change, such as \\nextreme water shortages. many women are \\nexpected to continue to manage the household \\nwithout problems, even with droughts affecting \\nhousehold water security in some of pakistan™s \\nbiggest cities. women narrated experiences of \\ntending to sick children with no resources and \\nof disappointing their husbands or other men in the household. women explained that they expe\\n-rienced physical forms of domestic violence for \\neither failing to manage the existing water in the \\nhouse, or for breaking norms around women™s \\nmobility by venturing out to secure new sources. \\nfinally, water and energy shortages that have \\nbeen exacerbated with climate change have \\nbeen associated in some cases with the mobili\\n-zation of men into non-state armed groups. for \\nexample, in karachi, a network of informal water \\nproviders, branded a ﬁwater ma˜aﬂ, has emerged. \\nthis group is reportedly using water scarcity \\nto gain power by intensifying water shortages \\nthrough illegal extraction, and then selling the \\nwater to communities via private tanker. the \\nrelated frustrations have led to community vio\\n-lence and ˜ghting between the ﬁwater ma˜aﬂ and \\nthe local population. \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n9.\\n \\n\\n\\n3710. \\n\\n\\nafter decades of violent con˚ict, nepal™s civil war \\nbetween the then maoist party and the govern\\n-ment of nepal ended with the signing of a peace \\nagreement in 2006. however, in the years leading \\nup to the signing of a new constitution in 2015 \\nand subsequent elections for a federal system \\nof government in 2017, socio-political tensions in \\nthe karnali river basin, in western nepal, often \\nresulted in protests and, at times, in violent con\\n-frontations. tensions around the inclusion of \\nminority groups in governance structures and \\nunequal access to natural resources manifested \\nin growing mistrust among different ethnic and \\nindigenous groups and between local commu\\n-nities and the government, the undercurrents of \\nwhich are still felt today. \\nthe impacts of climate change in western nepal \\nœ including higher temperatures, rainfall varia\\n-bility, and the melting of glaciers œ threaten to \\nfurther undermine this fragile socio-economic \\nfabric. a baseline study conducted to inform the \\ndesign of a unep project addressing climate-\\n related security risks in the region found that \\nthese changing dynamics have important inter\\n-sectional gender dimensions, which may pose \\nparticular risks œ as well as opportunities œ for \\nwomen™s empowerment. \\nfirst, constraints on access to natural resources \\nshaped by changing governance models and \\nperceived insecurity are exacerbated by climate \\nchange impacts. for instance, much of the forest \\nland œ which covers 61 percent of kailali district \\nand 39 percent of bardia district œ remains under \\njurisdiction of state government and continues to \\nbe characterized by a heavy presence of security \\n personnel, limiting community access to and use of \\nforest resources. at the same time, unpredictable \\n and uneven rainfall creates new challenges, such \\nas increased risks of ˚ooding and less productive \\n agricultural outputs. in consultations for the \\nbaseline study, women noted feeling particularly \\n vulnerable to these impacts, as higher levels of \\nfood insecurity created fertile ground for domestic \\n violence and greater burdens of care, as is often \\nseen after natural disasters.\\nas a result of constrained access to and relia\\n-bility of natural resources, community members \\nreported that out-migration of men was on the \\nincrease. seasonal migration of men to india \\nhas long been a primary source of livelihood for \\npeople in this region. however, as agriculture \\nbecomes less reliable due to unpredictable and \\nchanging rainfall patterns, men are extending \\ntheir stays in india. community members also \\nreported new migration destinations, inclu-\\n ding both cities within nepal and gulf countries, \\nfor men and women seeking alternative income \\nsources. women reported shouldering increased \\nburdens and experiencing higher levels of inse\\n-curity as the sole providers for their families in \\never more challenging environments. however, \\nmigration was also noted to be an effective \\nadaptation strategy, providing pathways for indi\\n-viduals œ mainly men œ to support their families \\nwith alternative income sources. \\ndespite the gender-related risks associated with \\nclimate change and security in nepal, women have \\nremained largely sidelined from decision-making \\nprocesses. barriers to inclusion are especially high \\nfor female members of the tharu ethnic minority, \\n who face multiple levels of marginalization as \\nwomen and members of a traditionally margina-\\n lized caste. interventions seeking to address these \\nrisks should enhance the leadership and technical \\ncapacities of women at local levels and work to \\nstrengthen the evidence base on climate change, \\ngovernance, and gender through local level know-\\n ledge generation, ensuring that the voices of the \\nmost marginalized are elevated in consultations \\nand dialogue with affected communities. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3811. \\n\\n\\nthe impacts of climate change, con˚ict and secu\\n-rity challenges, and gender inequality converge in \\na number of contexts in latin america, creating \\ncompounded risks for food security, especially \\nfor the most vulnerable groups. climate variabi-\\n lity and change present particular challenges for \\npoor smallholder farmers who rely on rain-fed \\nagriculture. at the same time, a range of security \\n concerns, such as internal con˚ict in colombia \\nor gang violence in el salvador and other nor-\\n thern triangle countries, limit people™s livelihood \\noptions. long-standing and deeply rooted gen\\n-der inequalities and the high rates of violence \\nagainst women and girls across the region fur\\n-ther constrain

\\nsecurity as communities are no longer able to rely \\non traditional approaches to farming and income \\ngeneration.\\nthe world food programme (wfp) has been work\\n-ing in the region for decades to provide food assis\\n-tance to vulnerable populations and governments. \\nrecent food secu\\n-rity interventions \\nthat support resi-\\n lience and adaptive \\ncapacities show \\nthat such

conducted jointly by wfp and \\nsipri in el salvador has pointed to ways food secu-\\n rity interventions can also contribute to building \\nsocial cohesion, a key condition to preventing \\ncommunity violence. for example, study infor-\\n mants described how a women™s group leveraged \\ninstitutional structures established by a food \\n security project to develop a community fund that \\nassists people in need, such as covering funeral \\ncosts, hospital transportation costs, or food aid \\nto families who have lost their primary income \\nprovider.\\ninitial ˜ndings from these three

america, climate change is contributing to increased \\ndrought, extreme temperatures, ˚oods and changes to rainfall patterns. in 2017, christian \\naid commissioned a study to explore the relationship between migration, gender and \\nclimate change in the region. the results are based on interviews and focus group discus\\n-sions with 251 people (184 women and 67 men) in communities in honduras, nicaragua, \\nguatemala and el salvador. the three main ˜ndings are as follows: \\n\\n study participants reported that periods of rain and drought were much less predictable \\nthan they were a decade ago. based on the interviews, migration was mainly temporary \\nand took place during the ˜rst planting season. in the past, there were two harvests each \\nyear, but in response to climate change, some dry corridor populations no longer risked \\nbeginning the ˜rst planting cycle and migrated in search of other sources of employ\\n-ment. however, many participants reported that violence played a more signi˜cant role \\nthan the impacts of climate change in decisions related to migration. \\n\\n in honduras and nicaragua, respondents perceived an increase among women who \\ndecided to migrate, including temporary migration during the coffee-picking season. \\nin guatemala and el salvador, respondents noted that migration continued to be pri\\n-marily male-dominated. \\n\\n women reported having to travel greater distances to secure water and to spend more \\ntime caring for ill people of all ages as a result of an increase in disease (including \\nrespiratory diseases, skin diseases and diseases such as the zika virus, chikungunya \\nand dengue, caused by higher numbers of mosquitoes). new migration patterns were \\nperceived as adding to women™s burdens. ﬁwhen a woman migrates,ﬂ they explained, \\nﬁher care-related duties fall on other women in the community. when a man migrates, \\nwomen take on high workloads and new responsibilities associated with the head of \\nthe household.ﬂ moreover, despite their increased responsibilities, women said they \\nfaced longstanding discriminatory practices related to land tenure. \\nsection

under the lima work programme on gender to support the \\nimplementation of the gender provisions in the unfccc and related agreements. \\n˜   adopt and support policies that hold governments

opportunities for \\nstrengthening women™s roles in peacebuilding through natural resource-related interventions are still \\nunder-explored. recommendations to ˜nancing partners are therefore as follows:\\n˜   donors wishing to strengthen women™s roles in all aspects of peacebuilding should invest in pro\\n-gramming that uses sustainable natural resource and climate-related interventions as an entry \\npoint. as this report has demonstrated, such interventions provide signi˜cant opportunities to \\nstrengthen women™s roles in dialogue and dispute resolution, in governance and in the economy. \\nsustainable natural resource programming also offers opportunities to mitigate sexual and gender-\\n based violence in con˚ict.\\n˜   multilateral funds dedicated to peace and security, such as the un peacebuilding fund, should ensure \\nthat new projects addressing climate-related security risks capitalize on the peacebuilding potential \\nof women and other marginalized groups on the frontlines of climate change. this entails not only \\nensuring that targeted funding œ such as the gender & youth promotion initiative œ is dedicated to \\nsupporting women™s leadership in addressing climate-related security risks, but also that new invest\\n-ments in regions affected by such risks speci˜cally target women as agents of peace. \\n˜   donors should consider dedicating more funding to supporting the resilience of women and margi-\\n nalized populations to climate-related security risks through programming in sustainable natural \\nresource management, including sustainable agricultural practices, forestry, water resource mana-\\n gement and renewable energy sources. \\n˜   multilateral funds dedicated to climate change mitigation and adaptation, such as the green climate \\nfund (gcf) and the global environment facility (gef) should ensure that women and other margina-\\n lized groups are increasingly targeted in programming seeking to address the climate change impacts \\nthat constitute potential factors of con˚ict. \\n˜   more investment in empirical research is needed to deepen understanding of the gender dimensions \\nof climate-related security risks across a greater selection of geographical and cultural contexts \\nwhere climate change and its impacts on peace and security are manifested in different ways. \\nfinancing\\n4% \\n\\n\\n\\n 62%  \\n \\n43innovative programming seeking to address interlinked gender, natural resource, climate and \\npeacebuilding issues is emerging that provides compelling early evidence of

initiatives should be \\nundertaken to promote gender-responsive programming on climate-related security risks at scale, \\nincluding through the following measures:\\n˜   distill and disseminate good practices and lessons learned from programmatic interventions that \\naddress the gender-differentiated impacts of climate-related security risks and engage women \\nand other marginalized groups to

existing \\nknowledge and understanding on the gender dimensions of climate-related security risks. while it \\nprovides important insights into how these dynamics are playing out in various contexts, a more syste-\\n matic approach is needed to investigate this nexus, including through the following:\\n˜   a multi-disciplinary research network or consortium dedicated to furthering empirical research on \\ngender, climate and security linkages should be established (as a new network or as part of exist\\n-ing expert working groups or consortia) to strengthen knowledge and evidence on these issues \\nthrough quantitative and qualitative methods.\\n˜   research should be carried out in full partnership with researchers from the global south and \\nshould consult local stakeholders on the formulation of research questions. such research should \\nalso seek to amplify local voices and stories.\\n˜   a common data repository should be created to collect and provide access to relevant existing data \\non the gender dimensions of climate-related security risks.\\n˜   research consortia should partner with policymakers as well as peace and development practi-\\n tioners to ensure uptake of research ˜ndings, such as through supporting the development of \\nimpactful policy frameworks and informing peace and development programmatic priorities.\\nspeci˜c knowledge gaps that merit further research identi˜ed in the writing of this report include (but \\nare not limited to):\\n˜   gender dynamics associated with climate and con˚ict-related migration and displacement œ what \\nmotivates women and men to migrate (or not)? how do motivations, risks and opportunities differ \\nbetween and among gender groups? \\n˜   women™s contributions to peacebuilding following extreme weather events or disasters œ what \\nrole do women play in different peacebuilding contexts that experience climate-related disasters? \\nwhat enabling factors exist to promote women™s leadership? \\n˜   women™s roles in informal governance structures in con˚ict and climate change affected contexts œ \\nhow are women contributing to governance when formal structures are not functioning? \\n˜   linkages between women™s access to land tenure, con˚ict mitigation and climate adaptation/\\nmitigation œ does promoting women™s access to land tenure contribute to mitigating local land \\ncon˚ict? how is this linked to building local climate resilience? \\n˜   how can big data, frontier technologies and mobiles phones be used to reduce women™s vulnera\\n-bility to climate-related security risks as well as empower them in peacebuilding?\\nwhile more research is needed across the global landscape, several geographical gaps have emerged \\nas contexts with particularly limited data:\\n˜   the middle east œ interactions between climate change, con˚ict and gender;\\n˜   central america œ interactions between climate change, crime, gender-based violence, and migration;\\n˜   south asia and the caribbean œ linkages between extreme weather events, community-based violence, \\nand gender;\\n˜   central asia œ gender-speci˜c risks and opportunities associated with water scarcity; and\\n˜   north america and europe œ climate-related risks for vulnerable groups of women and men, including \\nmigrants, undocumented populations, refugees, and those
