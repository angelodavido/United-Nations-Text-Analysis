kalandarov\\nforeword| vii |the 2030 agenda for sustainable development \\nputs forward a transformational vision \\nrecognizing that our world is changing, \\nbringing with it new challenges that must be \\novercome if we are to live in a world without \\nhunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in \\nany of its forms. \\nthe world population has grown steadily, \\nwith most people now living in urban \\nareas. technology has evolved at a dizzying \\npace, while the economy has become \\nincreasingly interconnected and globalized. \\nmany countries, however, have not witnessed \\nsustained growth as part of this new economy. \\nthe world economy as a whole is not growing \\nas much as expected. conflict and instability \\nhave increased and become more intractable, \\nspurring greater population displacement. \\nclimate change and increasing climate \\nvariability and extremes are affecting \\nagricultural productivity, food production \\nand natural resources, with impacts on food \\nsystems and rural livelihoods, including a \\ndecline in the number of farmers. all of this \\nhas led to major shifts in the way in which \\nfood is produced, distributed and consumed \\nworldwide œ and to new food security, \\nnutrition and health challenges.\\nthis is the third year that we have jointly \\nproduced \\nthe state of food security and nutrition \\nin the world\\n. it reaffirms our commitment to \\nworking together to overcome these emerging \\nchallenges and free the world from hunger, \\nfood insecurity and malnutrition. \\nrecent editions of the report showed that the \\ndecline in hunger the world had enjoyed for \\nover a decade was at an end, and that hunger \\nwas again on the rise. this year, the report \\nshows that the global level of the prevalence \\nof undernourishment has stabilized; however, \\nthe absolute number of undernourished people \\ncontinues to increase, albeit slowly.\\nmore than 820˜million people in the world are \\nstill hungry today, underscoring the immense \\nchallenge of achieving the zero hunger \\ntarget by 2030. hunger is rising in almost all \\nsubregions of africa and, to a lesser extent, in \\nlatin america and western asia. we welcome \\nthe great progress seen in southern asia \\nin the last five years, but the prevalence of \\nundernourishment in this subregion is still \\nthe highest in asia. \\nanother disturbing fact is that about \\n2˜billion people in the world experience \\nmoderate or severe food insecurity. the lack \\nof regular access to nutritious and sufficient \\nfood that these people experience puts them \\nat greater risk of malnutrition and poor \\nhealth. although primarily concentrated in \\nlow- and middle-income countries, moderate \\nor severe food insecurity also affects \\n8 percent of the population in northern \\namerica and europe. in every continent, \\nthe prevalence rate is slightly higher among \\nwomen than men.\\nwith regard to nutrition indicators, we are faring \\nno better. if current trends continue, \\n foreword\\nwe will meet neither the 2030 sdg target to \\nhalve the number of stunted children nor the \\n2025 world health assembly target to reduce \\nthe prevalence of low birthweight by 30 percent. \\nthis year™s report warns that one in seven live \\nbirths (20.5 million babies born globally) was \\ncharacterized by low birthweight in 2015 œ many \\nof these low birthweight babies were born to \\nadolescent mothers. the trends of overweight and \\nobesity give us additional reason for concern, as \\nthey continue to rise in all regions, particularly \\namong school-age children and adults. the most \\nrecent data show that obesity is contributing to \\n4 million deaths globally and is increasing the \\nrisk of morbidity for people in all age groups. \\nour actions to tackle these troubling trends \\nwill have to be bolder, not only in scale but \\nalso in terms of multisectoral collaboration, \\ninvolving the agriculture, food, health, water \\nand sanitation, education, and other relevant \\nsectors; and in different policy domains, \\nincluding social protection, development \\nplanning and economic policy. \\nas we seek solutions, we must keep in mind \\nthe fragile state of the world economy. \\nsince the sharp 2008œ2009 global economic \\ndownturn, there has been an uneven pace of \\nrecovery in many countries, and the global \\neconomic outlook is darkening again. \\nthis year, importantly, the report notes \\nthat hunger has been increasing in many \\ncountries where economic growth is lagging. \\nstrikingly, the majority of these countries are \\nnot low-income countries, but middle-income \\ncountries and countries that rely heavily on \\ninternational trade of primary commodities. \\neconomic shocks are also prolonging and \\nworsening the severity of acute food insecurity \\nin food crisis contexts. left unattended, these \\ntrends may have very unwelcome implications \\nfor malnutrition in all its forms. moreover, we \\nsee that economic slowdowns and downturns \\ndisproportionally challenge food security and \\nnutrition where inequalities in the distribution \\nof income and other resources are profound. \\nwe must recognize the importance of \\nsafeguarding food security and nutrition in \\ntimes of economic difficulty. we must invest \\nwisely during periods of economic booms \\nto reduce economic vulnerability and build \\ncapacity to withstand and quickly recover \\nwhen economic turmoil erupts. we must \\nfoster pro-poor and inclusive structural \\ntransformation focusing on people and \\nplacing communities at the centre to reduce \\neconomic vulnerabilities and set ourselves on \\ntrack to ending hunger, food insecurity and \\nall forms of malnutrition while ﬁleaving no \\none behindﬂ.\\nforeword\\n| viii |to make our transformational vision pro-poor \\nand inclusive, we must integrate food security \\nand nutrition concerns into poverty reduction \\nefforts to make the most of the synergies \\nbetween eradicating poverty, hunger, food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition. we must also \\nensure that reducing gender inequalities and \\nsocial exclusion of population groups is either \\nthe means to, or the outcome of, improved \\nfood security and nutrition.\\nthis will require accelerated and aligned actions \\nfrom all stakeholders and countries, including \\ntireless and more integrated support from the \\nunited nations and the international community \\nto countries in support of their development \\npriorities, through multilateral agreements and \\nmeans of implementation, so that countries can \\nembark on a pro-poor and inclusive path to \\ntransformation in a people-centred way to free \\nthe world from poverty, inequalities, hunger, \\nfood insecurity and malnutrition in all its forms.\\njosé graziano da silva\\nfao director-general\\ndavid beasley\\nwfp executive

of steady decline, the trend in \\nworld hunger œ as measured by the prevalence of \\nundernourishment œ reverted in 2015, remaining \\nvirtually unchanged in the past three years at a level \\nslightly below 11 percent. meanwhile, the number of \\npeople who suffer from hunger has slowly increased. \\nas a result, more than 820 million people in the \\nworld were still hungry in 2018, underscoring the \\nimmense challenge of achieving the zero hunger \\ntarget by 2030.\\n hunger is on the rise in almost all african \\nsubregions, making africa the region with the highest \\nprevalence of undernourishment, at almost 20˜percent. \\nhunger is also slowly rising in latin america and the \\ncaribbean, although its prevalence is still below \\n7˜percent. in asia, western asia shows a continuous \\nincrease since 2010, with more than 12˜percent of its \\npopulation undernourished today. \\n this year™s report introduces a second indicator for \\nmonitoring sdg target 2.1: the prevalence of \\nmoderate or severe food insecurity based on the \\nfood insecurity experience scale (fies). while severe \\nfood insecurity is associated with the concept of \\nhunger, people experiencing moderate food insecurity \\nface uncertainties about their ability to obtain food, \\nand have been forced to compromise on the quality \\nand/or quantity of the food they consume.\\n considering all people in the world affected by \\nmoderate levels of food insecurity together with \\nthose who suffer from hunger, it is estimated that \\nover 2˜billion people do not have regular access to \\nsafe, nutritious and sufficient food, including \\n8˜percent of the population in northern america \\nand europe. \\n one in seven newborns, or 20.5˜million \\nbabies globally, suffered from low birthweight in \\n2015; no progress has been made in reducing \\nlow birthweight since 2012. the number of \\nchildren under five years in the world affected by \\nstunting, by contrast, has decreased by 10˜percent \\nin the past six years. however, with 149˜million \\nchildren still stunted, the pace of progress is too \\nslow to meet the 2030 target of halving the \\nnumber of stunted children.\\n overweight and obesity continue to increase \\nin all regions, particularly among school-age \\nchildren and adults. in 2018, an estimated \\n40˜million children under five were overweight. \\n in 2016, 131˜million children 5œ9˜years˜old, \\n207˜million adolescents and 2˜billion adults were \\noverweight. about a third of overweight \\nadolescents and adults, and 44 percent of \\noverweight children aged 5œ9 were obese. \\n the economic costs of malnutrition are staggering.\\n| xiv | analysis of household and individual level data from \\nselected countries across all regions shows that food \\ninsecurity plays an important role as a determinant of \\nmany different forms of malnutrition. in upper-middle- \\nand high-income countries in particular, living in a \\nfood-insecure household is a predictor of obesity in \\nschool-age children, adolescents, and adults. \\n previous editions of this report show how conflict \\nand climate variability and extremes are exacerbating \\nthe above trends. this year the report shows that the \\nuneven pace of economic recovery and continuing \\npoor economic performance in many countries after \\nthe 2008œ2009 global economic downturn are also \\nundermining efforts to end hunger and malnutrition. \\nepisodes of financial stress, elevated trade tensions and \\ntightening financial conditions are contributing to \\nuncertain global economic prospects. \\n hunger has increased in many countries where the \\neconomy has slowed down or contracted, mostly in \\nmiddle-income countries. furthermore, economic shocks \\nare contributing to prolonging and worsening the \\nseverity of food crises caused primarily by conflict and \\nclimate shocks. \\n out of 65˜countries where recent adverse impacts of \\neconomic slowdowns and downturns on food security \\nand nutrition have been strongest, 52˜countries rely \\nheavily on primary commodity exports and/or imports. \\n economic slowdowns or downturns \\ndisproportionally undermine food security and \\nnutrition where inequalities are greater. income \\ninequality increases the likelihood of severe food \\ninsecurity, and this effect is 20 percent higher for \\nlow-income countries compared with middle-\\nincome countries. income and wealth inequalities \\nare also closely associated with undernutrition, \\nwhile more complex inequality patterns are \\nassociated with obesity.\\n to safeguard food security and nutrition, it is \\ncritical to already have in place economic and \\nsocial policies to counteract the effects of adverse \\neconomic cycles when they arrive, while avoiding \\ncuts in essential services, such as health care and \\neducation, at all costs. in the longer term, \\nhowever, this will only be possible through \\nfostering pro-poor and inclusive structural \\ntransformation, particularly in countries that rely \\nheavily on trade in primary commodities.\\n to ensure that structural transformation is \\npro-poor and inclusive requires integrating food \\nsecurity and nutrition concerns into poverty \\nreduction efforts, while ensuring that reducing \\ngender inequalities and social exclusion of \\npopulation groups is either the means to, or \\noutcome of, improved food security and nutrition.\\n| xv |executive summary \\nadvancing the monitoring of \\n food security and nutrition in \\n the era of the 2030 agenda for \\nsustainable development \\ntwo years ago, this annual report was \\ntransformed to meet the needs of a new era \\nin monitoring the progress made towards \\nachieving a world without hunger and \\nmalnutrition in all its forms, within the \\nframework of the sustainable development \\ngoals (sdgs). specifically, the report began \\nin 2017 to monitor progress towards both \\nthe targets of ending hunger and ensuring \\naccess to food by all (sdg target 2.1) and \\nof eliminating all forms of malnutrition \\n(sdg target 2.2). given the broadened scope \\nto include a focus on nutrition, the report \\nwas renamed \\nthe state of food security and \\nnutrition in the world\\n, and unicef and the \\nworld health organization (who) joined \\nthe traditional partnership of fao, ifad \\nand wfp in preparing it. to provide better \\nguidance on how to meet the challenges \\nof the changing world, the report was also \\nexpanded to include an in-depth thematic \\nanalysis on the underlying factors and drivers \\nbehind the observed food security and \\nnutrition trends, and to link progress towards \\nimproved food security and nutrition with \\nother sdgs.\\nthis report has traditionally tracked world hunger \\nusing the prevalence of undernourishment (pou), \\none of the indicators used to monitor global \\nprogress towards sdg target 2.1. this year the \\nreport takes another step forward by reporting, \\nfor the first time, another indicator of the global \\nsdg monitoring framework: the prevalence of \\nmoderate or severe food insecurity based on the \\nfood insecurity experience scale (fies). the 2030 \\nagenda, by including this indicator, recognizes \\nthat food insecurity is more than hunger. \\nthe zero hunger goal aims not simply to \\nﬁeradicate hungerﬂ, but also to ﬁensure access by \\nall people [–] to safe, nutritious and sufficient \\nfood all year roundﬂ (sdg target 2.1) and to \\nﬁeradicate all forms of malnutritionﬂ \\n(sdg target 2.2). fortunately, data-gathering \\n and measurement tools are rapidly evolving to \\nmeet the monitoring challenges presented by the \\nnew agenda and this report now includes this \\nnew indicator of food insecurity. the report thus \\nreflects a more comprehensive approach to \\nmonitoring progress towards eliminating hunger, \\nfood insecurity and malnutrition and to \\nunderstanding the interrelationships \\nbetween them. \\nafter a decade of steady decline, \\n the number of people suffering \\nfrom hunger in the world has \\nslowly increased for several \\n years in a row, underscoring \\n the immense challenge of ending \\nhunger by 2030\\nthe two most recent editions of this report \\nalready offered evidence that the decline \\nseen in the prevalence of undernourishment \\nin the world over a decade had ended, \\nand that hunger was slowly on the rise. \\nevidence available this year confirms that \\nthe global level of the prevalence of \\nundernourishment has remained virtually \\nunchanged in the last three years, at a level \\nslightly below 11 percent. the absolute number \\nof people suffering from hunger, however, \\ncontinues to increase, albeit slowly. more than \\n820˜million people in the world are hungry \\ntoday, underscoring the immense challenge of \\nachieving the zero hunger target by 2030. \\nhunger is on the rise in almost all \\nsubregions of africa, where the prevalence \\nof undernourishment has reached levels of \\n22.8˜percent in sub-saharan africa, and to \\n| xvi |a lesser extent in latin america. in asia, \\ndespite great progress in the last five years, \\nsouthern asia is still the subregion where the \\nprevalence of undernourishment is highest, \\nat almost 15˜percent, followed by western \\nasia, at over 12˜percent, where the situation \\nis worsening. looking across regions, the \\nundernourished population is distributed \\nunevenly, with the majority living in asia \\n(more than 500˜million). the number has \\nbeen increasing steadily in africa where \\nit reached almost 260˜million people in \\n2018, with more than 90˜percent living in \\nsub-saharan africa. \\na broader look at the extent of food \\ninsecurity, beyond hunger, shows that \\n17.2˜percent of the world population, or \\n1.3˜billion people, have experienced food \\ninsecurity at moderate levels. this means that \\nthey do not have regular access to nutritious \\nand sufficient food œ even if they are not \\nnecessarily suffering from hunger, they are at \\ngreater risk of various forms of malnutrition \\nand poor health. the combination of \\nmoderate and severe levels of food insecurity \\nbrings the estimate to 26.4˜percent of the \\nworld population, amounting to a total of \\nabout 2˜billion people. \\nin high-income countries, too, sizeable \\nportions of the population lack regular access \\nto nutritious and sufficient food. eight percent \\nof the population in northern america and \\neurope is estimated to be food insecure, \\nmainly at moderate levels of severity.\\na closer examination of the estimates of \\nfood insecurity (moderate and severe) points \\nalso to a gender gap. in every continent, \\nthe prevalence of food insecurity is slightly \\nhigher among women than men, with the \\nlargest differences found in latin america.\\nchildhood stunting is decreasing \\ntoo slowly and anaemia in women \\npersists; but overweight and \\nobesity are actually rising in most \\ncountries, calling attention to the \\nneed for greater efforts to halt \\nand reverse this growing epidemic\\nthis year the report takes a closer look at \\ndata on overweight and obesity, a serious \\npublic health challenge affecting people of \\nall ages. obesity is on the rise in almost all \\ncountries, contributing to 4˜million deaths \\nglobally. the increase in prevalence of \\nobesity between 2000 and 2016 has been even \\nfaster than that of overweight. no region \\nis exempt from the epidemic of overweight \\nand obesity. the prevalence of overweight is \\nincreasing in all age groups, with particularly \\nsteep increases among school-age children \\nand adults. throughout the world, most \\nschool-age children do not eat enough fruit or \\nvegetables, regularly consume fast food and \\ncarbonated soft drinks, and are not physically \\nactive on a daily basis. multifaceted, \\nmultisectoral approaches are needed to \\nhalt and reverse the obesity epidemic. \\npolicies to protect, promote and support \\nbreastfeeding and to increase the availability \\nand affordability of nutritious foods that \\nconstitute a healthy diet are required, along \\nwith measures to create healthier food \\nenvironments and limit consumption of \\nharmful fats, salt and sugars. \\nit is encouraging to note that the number of \\nstunted children has declined by 10˜percent \\nover the past six years, but this rate of \\nreduction is too slow to achieve the 2030 \\ntarget of a 50˜percent reduction in the number \\nof stunted children. while the prevalence of \\nstunting is decreasing in almost every region, \\nthe extent of progress varies considerably. \\n| xvii |africa has made the least progress in reducing \\nstunting prevalence since 2012. in 2018, \\nafrica and asia accounted for more than nine \\nout of ten of all stunted children globally, \\nrepresenting 39.5˜percent and 54.9˜percent of \\nthe global total, respectively. \\nin the next ten years, urgent action is needed \\nto achieve other global nutrition targets as \\nwell. only 40˜percent of infants under six \\nmonths are exclusively breastfed, which is far \\nfrom the 2030 target of 70˜percent. in 2018, \\n7.3˜percent of children were wasted, and this \\nmust be reduced by more than half to reach \\nthe target of less than 3˜percent by 2030. \\nanaemia currently affects 33˜percent of women \\nof reproductive age œ more than double the \\n2030 target of 15˜percent.\\nlow birthweight estimates are included \\nfor the first time in this year™s edition of \\nthe report, following the release of new \\nglobal estimates. they indicate that one \\nin seven live births, or 20.5˜million babies \\nglobally, suffered from low birthweight in \\n2015. new evidence this year also shows \\nthat no progress has been made in reducing \\nthe prevalence of low birthweight since \\n2012. this lack of progress signals that \\nit will be difficult to achieve the world \\nhealth assembly global goal of a 30˜percent \\nreduction in the prevalence of low birthweight \\ninfants by 2030. this is concerning, as low \\nbirthweight newborns have a higher risk of \\ndying in the first month of life, and those \\nwho survive are more likely to suffer from \\nstunted growth and face increased risk of \\nadult-onset chronic conditions including \\nobesity and diabetes. \\nbeyond the immense human costs of \\nmalnutrition, the economic costs are \\nstaggering. it is projected that undernutrition \\nwill reduce gross domestic product (gdp) \\nby up to 11˜percent in africa and asia, while \\nobesity costs usd˜2˜trillion annually, largely \\ndriven by the value placed on lost economic \\nproductivity, plus direct healthcare costs \\nworldwide. the various forms of malnutrition \\nare intertwined throughout the life cycle and \\nbetween generations, with undernutrition in \\nfoetal and early life contributing to stunted \\nphysical growth and higher risk of overweight \\nand chronic diseases like diabetes later in \\nlife. the un decade of action on nutrition, \\nbased on the icn2 framework for action, \\nemphasizes that tackling malnutrition in all \\nits forms is not the domain of any one sector \\nalone. the health, education, agriculture, \\nsocial protection, planning and economic \\npolicy sectors all have a role to play, as well as \\nlegislators and other political leaders.\\nmoderate levels of food insecurity œ defined \\nas uncertain access to food of sufficient \\nquality and/or quantity, but not so extreme \\nthat it causes insufficient dietary energy \\nintake (undernourishment) œ can increase \\nthe risk of seemingly divergent forms of \\nmalnutrition, including overweight and \\nobesity. analysis of household and individual \\nlevel data from selected countries across all \\nregions reveals that food insecurity plays an \\nimportant role as a determinant of different \\nforms of malnutrition in all countries studied. \\nin upper-middle- and high-income countries, \\nliving in a food-insecure household is a \\npredictor of obesity in school-age children, \\nadolescents and adults. factors that help to \\nexplain the link between food insecurity and \\noverweight and obesity include the higher \\ncost of nutritious foods (and their substitution \\nwith cheaper foods that are high in fats and \\nsugar), the stress of living with uncertain \\naccess to food, and physiological adaptations \\nto food restrictions. \\n| xviii |economic slowdowns and \\ndownturns pose challenges for \\nfood security and nutrition; \\ncreating sustained escapes requires \\nsafeguarding against these and \\ntackling increasing inequalities\\nprevious editions of this report identified that \\nconflict, climate variability and extremes, and \\neconomic slowdowns were behind the recent \\nrise in hunger. the previous two editions \\nrespectively provided an in-depth analysis \\non the first two drivers. this year the report \\nlooks closely at the third key driver, economic \\nslowdowns, broadening the focus to also \\ninclude economic downturns.\\nthe risk that the unwelcome trends in \\nhunger, food insecurity and malnutrition \\ndescribed above will continue is particularly \\nhigh today, considering the fragile state and \\nworrisome outlook of the world economy. \\nthe latest global economic prospects warn of \\nslowing and stalled economic growth in many \\ncountries, including emerging and developing \\neconomies. most regions rebounded after the \\nsharp 2008œ2009 global economic downturn, \\nbut the recovery has been uneven and short \\nlived, as many countries have experienced \\ngenerally declining trends in economic \\ngrowth since 2011. episodes of financial \\nstress, elevated trade tensions and tightening \\nfinancial conditions are clouding global \\neconomic prospects.\\nnew evidence confirms hunger has been \\non the rise for many of the countries where \\nthe economy slowed down or contracted. \\nmost countries (65 out of 77) that experienced \\na rise in undernourishment between \\n2011 and 2017 simultaneously suffered \\nan economic slowdown or downturn. \\nstrikingly, the majority of these cases \\ninvolved not low-income countries, but \\nmiddle-income countries. economic shocks \\nhave also prolonged and worsened the impact \\nof conflict and climate events on acute food \\ninsecurity requiring urgent humanitarian \\nassistance in food crisis countries. in more \\nthan half of the countries affected by food \\ncrises in 2018, the compounding impact \\nof multiple economic shocks worsened the \\nseverity of acute food insecurity, affecting \\n96 million people. \\nmarked declines in primary commodity prices \\nhave contributed to economic slowdowns \\nand downturns during the 2011œ2017 period, \\nmainly affecting countries highly dependent \\non primary commodity exports and/or \\nimports. most countries (52 out of 65) that saw \\nundernourishment rise during recent economic \\nslowdowns and downturns are countries \\nwhose economies are highly dependent on \\nprimary commodities for export and/or imports. \\nin 2018, most of the countries (81 percent) \\nwhere economic shocks worsened the \\nseverity of the food crises were high primary \\ncommodity-dependent countries. \\neconomic events generally affect food security \\nand nutrition, depending on the extreme \\npoverty level, but also on the existence of \\ninequalities in income distribution as well as \\nin access to basic services and assets, many \\nof which result from social exclusion and the \\nmarginalization of groups. where inequality is \\ngreater, economic slowdowns and downturns \\nhave a disproportionate effect on food \\n security and nutrition for lower-income \\npopulations. inequality increases the \\nlikelihood of severe food insecurity and this \\neffect is 20˜percent higher for low-income \\ncountries compared with middle-income \\ncountries. income and wealth inequalities are \\nalso closely associated with undernutrition, \\nwhile more complex inequality patterns are \\nassociated with obesity.\\n| xix |this report calls for action on two fronts: \\nthe first, safeguarding food security and \\nnutrition through economic and social \\npolicies that help counteract the effects of \\neconomic slowdowns or downturns, including \\nguaranteeing funding of social safety nets \\nand ensuring universal access to health \\nand education; and, the second, tackling \\nexisting inequalities at all levels through \\nmultisectoral policies that make it possible to \\nmore sustainably escape from food insecurity \\nand malnutrition. acting on these two \\nfronts requires short- and long-term policy \\nresponses that will depend on institutional \\ncapacity and availability of contingency \\nmechanisms and funds to support them. \\nthe latter, in turn, requires strengthening \\nthe savings capacity of the economy when \\nit is growing, so as to make countercyclical \\npolicies feasible when the need arises. \\nin the short term, countries need to protect \\nincomes and purchasing power, particularly \\nfor the most affected households, through \\nsocial protection programmes, including cash \\ntransfers and school feeding; public works \\nprogrammes that help reduce unemployment; \\nhealth sector policies that protect the poor \\nagainst catastrophic out-of-pocket healthcare \\ncosts; and, if needed, policies aimed at reducing \\nexcessive volatility of food prices. in the \\nlonger term, countries need to invest wisely \\nduring periods of economic booms to reduce \\neconomic vulnerabilities and inequalities; \\nbuild capacity to withstand shocks; maintain \\nhealth and other social expenditures; use policy \\ntools to create healthier food environments; \\nand quickly recover when economic turmoil \\nerupts. this requires balancing a set of policies \\nand investments to achieve a structural \\ntransformation that also fosters poverty \\nreduction and more egalitarian societies. \\nit is imperative, in particular, that countries \\nwith economies that are highly dependent on \\nprimary commodities foster such inclusive \\nstructural transformation to reduce their \\neconomic vulnerability.\\nthis structural transformation, involving \\nagriculture and food systems, must help ensure \\nthat food security and nutrition objectives are \\nmet. this will depend on the type of commodities \\nand the quality of food that is generated under \\nthis process, and will require fostering better \\naccess to more nutritious foods that constitute \\na healthy diet to all. policymakers must also \\nensure that policies that facilitate trade also help \\nachieve nutrition objectives. integrating food \\nsecurity and nutrition concerns into poverty \\nreduction efforts, while increasing synergies \\nbetween poverty reduction, hunger and \\nmalnutrition eradication must also be part of the \\ntransformation. furthermore, reducing gender \\ninequalities and those inequalities arising from \\nsocial discrimination and exclusion of population \\ngroups needs to be either the means to improving \\nfood security and nutrition, or the outcome of \\ndoing so.\\nthe trends, findings and policy \\nrecommendations briefly presented in this \\nexecutive summary are discussed in much \\ngreater detail in the two parts of this report. \\npart 1 presents the most recent trends in \\nhunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in all \\nits forms with a focus on monitoring progress \\non sdg targets 2.1 and 2.2. it introduces for \\nthe first time one of the indicators of the sdg \\nmonitoring framework for sdg target 2.1: \\n the prevalence of moderate or severe food \\ninsecurity based on the food insecurity \\nexperience scale (fies). this year™s report \\nalso presents for the first time low birthweight \\nestimates. the last section of part 1 presents \\nnew evidence on the links between moderate \\n or severe food insecurity and the various forms \\n of malnutrition. \\n| xx |part 2 looks closely at the role that economic \\nslowdowns and downturns have played in \\nrecent food security and nutrition trends. \\nthe analysis ultimately points to guidance \\non what short- and long-term policies are \\nnecessary to safeguard food security and \\nnutrition, either during episodes of economic \\nturmoil or in preparation for them. this is \\nparticularly relevant today given the alarming \\nsigns in the world economy, so that policy \\nconsiderations are relevant to achieving \\nthe goals of ending hunger and all forms of \\nmalnutrition by 2030 (sdg targets 2.1 and \\n2.2) as well as other related sdgs, especially \\nœ though not exclusively œ eradicating \\nextreme poverty (sdg 1), ensuring decent \\nwork and inclusive economic growth (sdg 8), \\nand reducing inequalities (sdg 10).\\n| xxi |south

since 1974, when fao first \\nbegan reporting on the extent of hunger in the \\nworld. the world population has grown steadily, \\nwith most people now living in urban areas. \\ntechnology has evolved at a dizzying pace, \\nwhile the economy has become increasingly \\ninterconnected and globalized. all of this has \\nled to major shifts in the way in which food is \\nproduced, distributed and consumed worldwide. \\nbut these transformations have also brought \\nabout worrying developments in malnutrition. \\nalthough the prevalence of child stunting \\nhas decreased significantly over the past 20 \\nyears, overweight and obesity, and diet-related \\nnon-communicable diseases, are rapidly on \\n the rise. \\nthis vastly different world calls for new ways of \\nthinking about hunger and food insecurity and \\ntheir consequences for nutrition. the imperative \\nis to make sure no one suffers from hunger. \\nbut we must also recognize that there are many \\npeople who, while not ﬁhungryﬂ in the sense that \\nthey suffer physical discomfort caused by severe \\nlack of dietary energy, may still be food insecure. \\nthey have access to food to meet their energy \\nrequirements, yet are uncertain that it will last, \\nand may be forced to reduce the quality and/or \\nquantity of the food they eat in order to get by. \\nthis moderate level of severity of food insecurity \\ncan contribute to various forms of malnutrition \\nand has serious consequences for health and \\nwell-being. \\nthe un member countries recognized the \\nimportance of going beyond hunger when they \\nset universal and ambitious targets for the 2030 \\nagenda for sustainable development. the ﬁzero \\nhungerﬂ goal aims not simply to ﬁeradicate \\nhungerﬂ, but also to ﬁensure access by all people \\n[–] to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year \\nroundﬂ (sdg target 2.1) and to ﬁeradicate all \\nforms of malnutritionﬂ (sdg target 2.2). for this \\nreason, this report was renamed \\nthe state of \\nfood security and nutrition in the world\\n in 2017. \\nsince then it has reported on nutrition indicators, \\nin addition to food security indicators.\\npart 1 of this year™s report aims to bring new \\nways of thinking to bear on the latest trends \\nin hunger, food insecurity, and various forms \\nof malnutrition. section 1.1 presents global, \\nregional and subregional figures of hunger and \\nintroduces a new indicator of food insecurity that \\ngoes beyond hunger to include moderate levels \\nof food insecurity. section 1.2 presents the latest \\nfigures for seven nutrition indicators, including \\nthree sdg 2 indicators of child malnutrition \\n(stunting, wasting and overweight), with a \\nspotlight on the rapid rise in overweight and \\nobesity. the links between food

recent trends \\n in hunger and \\n food insecurity \\n key messages \\n after decades of steady decline, the trend in \\nworld hunger œ as measured by the prevalence of \\nundernourishment œ reverted in 2015, remaining \\nvirtually unchanged in the past three years at a level \\nslightly below 11 percent. meanwhile, the number of \\npeople who suffer from hunger has slowly increased. \\nas a result, more than 820 million people in the world \\nare still hungry today, underscoring the immense \\nchallenge of achieving the zero hunger target by 2030.\\n this recent trend is confirmed by estimates of \\nsevere food insecurity in the world based on the \\n food insecurity experience scale (fies), which is \\nanother way to monitor hunger.\\n hunger is on the rise in almost all subregions \\nof africa, the region with the highest prevalence of \\nundernourishment, at almost 20 percent. it is also \\nrising slowly in latin america and the caribbean, \\nalthough the prevalence there is still below 7 percent. \\nin asia, where undernourishment affects 11 percent \\nof the population, southern asia saw great progress \\nin the last five years but is still the subregion with \\nthe highest prevalence of undernourishment, at \\nalmost 15 percent, followed by western asia at over \\n12 percent, where the situation is worsening.\\n estimates of sdg indicator 2.1.2, which monitors \\nprogress towards the target of ensuring access to food \\nfor all, reveal that a total of about 2 billion people in \\nthe world experience some level of food insecurity, \\nincluding moderate. people who are moderately food \\ninsecure may not necessarily suffer from hunger, \\n but they lack regular access to nutritious and sufficient \\nfood, putting them at greater risk of various forms of \\nmalnutrition and poor health. \\n this new indicator also reveals that even in \\nhigh-income countries, sizeable portions of the \\npopulation lack regular access to nutritious and \\nsufficient food; 8 percent of the population in \\nnorthern america and europe is estimated to be \\nfood insecure, mainly at moderate levels.\\n in every continent, the prevalence of food \\ninsecurity is slightly higher among women than men, \\nwith the largest differences found in latin america.\\nfood insecurity is more than just hungerthe main indicator for monitoring progress on \\nthe eradication of \\nhunger\\n in the world reported in \\nthis report is the \\nprevalence of undernourishment\\n, or pou (sdg indicator 2.1.1). beginning in 2017, \\nthe prevalence of \\nsevere\\n food insecurity based \\non the \\nfood insecurity experience scale\\n (fies) \\nwas also included in the report as another, \\ncomplementary indicator of hunger using a \\ndifferent approach.\\nthis year\\'s report now takes a step forward by \\nalso reporting, for the first time, estimates of the \\nprevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity \\nbased on the fies (sdg indicator 2.1.2). \\nthis indicator provides a perspective on global \\nfood insecurity relevant for all countries of the \\nworld: one that looks beyond hunger towards \\nthe goal of ensuring access to nutritious and \\nsufficient food for all (\\nbox 1\\n). as estimates of \\nsdg indicator 2.1.2 refer to the total number of \\npeople suffering from food insecurity, including \\nat moderate levels, it should come as no surprise \\nthat they correspond to a much higher number of \\npeople than those who suffer from hunger.\\nthe state of food security and nutrition in the world

indicator 2.1.1) and prevalence of moderate \\nor severe food insecurity based on the food insecurity \\nexperience scale œ fies (sdg indicator 2.1.2).sdg indicator 2.1.1, the prevalence of \\nundernourishment (pou),\\n is fao™s traditional indicator \\nused to monitor hunger at the global and regional \\nlevels. it is computed from aggregated country-level \\ndata on food available for human consumption \\n(compiled annually for most countries in the world in \\nfao™s food balance sheets) and on less frequently \\nobtained data on food consumption from surveys, \\navailable for a growing (but still partial) number of \\ncountries. for each country, the distribution of average, \\ndaily dietary energy consumption in the population is \\ncompared with the distribution of dietary energy needs \\n(derived from the composition of the population by \\nage, gender and physical activity levels) to produce an \\nestimate of the proportion of the population that lacks \\nenough dietary energy for a healthy, active life.\\nsdg indicator 2.1.2, the prevalence of moderate \\nor severe food insecurity in the population (fimod+sev) based on the food insecurity experience scale \\n(fies), was developed by fao to complement the \\ninformation provided by the pou and to provide a \\nbroader perspective on the food access dimension \\nof food security.\\n2 the approach relies on data \\nobtained by directly asking people through surveys \\nabout the occurrence of conditions and behaviours \\nthat are known to reflect constrained access to \\nfood. based on their responses to the fies survey \\nmodule items, the individuals surveyed are assigned \\na probability of being in one of three classes, as \\ndefined by two globally set thresholds: food secure \\nor marginally insecure; moderately food insecure; \\nand severely food insecure. the fimod+sev is the \\ncumulative probability of being in the two classes \\nof moderate and severe food insecurity. a separate

to a lack \\nof consistent access to food, which diminishes dietary \\nquality, disrupts normal eating patterns, and can \\nhave negative consequences for nutrition, health and \\nwell-being. people facing severe food insecurity, on the \\nother hand, have likely run out of food, experienced \\nhunger and, at the most extreme, gone for days without \\neating, putting their health and well-being at grave risk.the figure below illustrates the meaning of food \\nsecurity, moderate food insecurity and severe food \\ninsecurity, with each category shown as a proportion \\nof the total population. fisev can be considered a \\ncomplementary indicator to the pou in measuring \\nthe extent of hunger. sdg indicator 2.1.2 (fi\\nmod+sev) is \\nthe proportion of the total population represented by \\nthose who experience food insecurity at moderate or \\nsevere levels combined. this indicator is particularly \\nrelevant for countries where severe food deprivation \\nmay no longer be of concern, but where sizeable \\npockets of food insecurity still remain. in this sense, it \\nis an indicator that is fully aligned with the universality \\nprinciples of the 2030 agenda.as a measure of access to adequate food, \\nindicator 2.1.2 brings the perspective of the right to \\nfood to the sdg monitoring framework. countries can \\nuse the fies to obtain data-based evidence about the

done in order to capture possible \\nrecent changes in the inequality on access to food, \\nwhich would be reflected in fisev. minimum dietary energy requirements (mder) for \\n2018 were computed based on the 2018 projected \\npopulation structure from the world population \\nprospects, 2017 revision.21 fao trade and markets division has developed and maintained a commodity balance sheet database (xcbs) that provides up-to-date and elementary information for analysis of the state \\nof agricultural commodity markets at global and regional levels, as well as the food situation of all countries in the world. the xcbs contains balance sheet-structured data for the major \\ncommodities in the following groups: cereals, dairy, meat, oil-bearing crops, sugar, tropical beverages, bananas and citrus since the 1980s. data from the xcbs are used in a number of \\nsystems and publications, such as fao global information and early warning system, agricultural market information

estimates so that they are globally comparable\\nexperience-based food security measurement scales \\nhave been in use for many years in a number \\nof countries, mainly in the americas. to create \\ncategories for different levels of food insecurity, each \\ncountry has chosen its own national thresholds, as \\nwell as its own naming systems. for example, in the \\nunited states of america households are classified as \\nhaving ﬁhighﬂ, ﬁmarginalﬂ, ﬁlowﬂ or ﬁvery low food \\nsecurityﬂ; while in brazil or in mexico they use the \\nterms ﬁmildﬂ, ﬁmoderateﬂ or ﬁsevereﬂ food insecurity. \\nhowever, although the labels used are similar, the \\nresulting classes are not directly comparable across \\ndifferent countries.with the objective of ensuring truly comparable \\nclassifications, fao launched the voices of the \\nhungry project in 2012. as described below, it was \\nnecessary to establish a global reference scale on \\nwhich the thresholds for classification into severe \\nand moderate food insecurity could be set, and to \\ndevelop procedures to calibrate scores obtained in \\ndifferent countries against this global standard.1the eight items (questions) that compose the fies \\nsurvey module are chosen to represent a range of \\nexperiences, common to many cultures, that cover a \\nbroad range of severity on the underlying scale of \\nfood insecurity, from mild to severe. however, the \\nthe fies survey moduleduring the last 12 months, was there a time when, because of lack of money or other resources:you were worried you would not have enough food to eat?you were unable to eat healthy and nutritious food?you ate only a few kinds of foods?you had to skip a meal?you ate less than you thought you should?your household ran out of food?you were hungry but did not eat?you went without eating for a whole day?12345678  fies measures obtained in different countries need to be equated before comparing them, to make sure they are expressed on the same reference

to analyse the \\ndata (rasch model)2 allows for the identification of the \\nrelative position of the various items along a severity \\nscale, based on patterns of responses to the eight \\nitems, with the basic idea being that the more severe \\nan experience is, the less likely respondents are to \\nreport it. each country thus obtains its own scale but \\nthey are not directly comparable across countries.to establish the global fies reference scale, \\n fao followed a process that is similar to what \\nhas been common in many other applications \\nof measurement principles, for example, the \\nestablishment of the coordinated universal time, \\nwhich is used to regulate clocks and time globally. \\nin that case, the average of the time kept by \\nover 400 highly precise atomic clocks in over \\n50 laboratories worldwide is used to ensure one \\ncommon standard reference time. to establish the \\nfies reference scale, fao used data collected in \\nmore than 140˜countries worldwide, from 2014 \\nthrough 2016 and followed process (consisting \\nmainly of two steps) that led to assigning each \\nfies item a position on what became the standard \\nseverity scale. \\n| 16 |1 see c. cafiero, s. viviani and m. nord. 2017. food security measurement in a global context: the food insecurity experience scale\\n. measurement\\n, 116 (february 2018):

2017, shows that area of residence, \\npoverty status and education level are significant \\ndeterminants of the difference in food insecurity \\nlevels between men and women (see annex 2 for \\nthe methodology). globally, the gender gap in \\nfood insecurity appears to be larger among the \\nless-educated, poorer strata of the population, \\nand in urban (large city and suburbs) settings. \\nafter controlling for area of residence (rural or \\nsmall town versus large city or suburbs), poverty \\nstatus and education level of the respondents,\\n the chances of being food insecure are still \\napproximately 10 percent higher for women than \\nfor men. this finding reveals that other œ possibly \\nsubtler œ forms of discrimination make access to \\nfood more difficult for women, even when they \\nhave the same income and education levels as \\nmen and live in similar areas. \\nanother study using global fies data found \\nthat gender differences in household income, \\neducational attainment and social networks \\nexplain most of the gender gap in food \\ninsecurity.\\n13 this suggests that policies that \\naddress gender inequality in employment \\nopportunities and educational attainment may \\nalso have an impact on food insecurity. part˜2 \\nof this report looks more closely at the different \\ngender dimensions of inequality that affect food \\nsecurity and nutrition, both within communities \\nand within households, and outlines the policies \\nand approaches needed to address these. \\nglobal fies data provide evidence of both causes and consequences of food insecurity at the household and individual levels studies using the fies or comparable \\nexperience-based food-insecurity measures \\ncomprise a growing body of evidence on causes \\nand consequences of food insecurity at the \\nhousehold and individual levels. three studies in \\nparticular œ one using fies data collected by fao \\nthrough the gallup® world poll in the global \\nsample of nearly 140 countries,\\n14 and two others \\nfocusing specifically on sub-saharan africa\\n15 and \\narab countries\\n16 œ concluded that the likelihood \\nof being food insecure was higher for people \\nwho were unemployed and had low levels of \\neducation and household income, corroborating \\nthe results of the analysis of country-level \\nindicators presented in \\nbox 4\\n. in the first study, it \\nwas also found that people with low social capital \\nand weak social networks were more likely to be \\nfood insecure. elsewhere, yet another study using \\nthe global fies data found that food insecurity \\nwas strongly and negatively associated with \\nsubjective well-being, regardless of household \\nincome level or social support. this was found \\nto be true in countries of all income classes, but \\nmore so in high-income countries. in fact, food \\ninsecurity explained poor physical health and \\nlower subjective well-being more than other \\nindicators of living conditions such as household \\nincome, shelter and housing, and employment.\\n17 food insecurity can affect health and \\nwell-being in many ways, with potentially \\nnegative consequences for mental, social \\nand physical well-being. many studies using \\nexperience-based food-insecurity scales have \\ndocumented negative psychosocial effects \\nof food insecurity in women and children.\\n18 furthermore, one particular study using the \\nglobal fies data found that food insecurity \\nis associated with poorer mental health and \\nspecific psychosocial stressors across global \\nregions independent of socio-economic status.\\n19there is also a large body of evidence on the \\nlinks between food insecurity and nutritional \\noutcomes (as described in the 2018 report). \\ntogether with the evidence cited above, this \\ngrowing body of research highlights the value \\nof experience-based measures of food insecurity \\nlike the fies. it is worth emphasizing, as well, \\nthat the fies-based indicators and the pou are \\nnot to be confused with indicators used in food \\ncrisis situations (\\nbox 5\\n). \\nthe next section presents the latest figures \\non progress towards ending all forms of \\nmalnutrition, with a special focus on overweight \\nand obesity. the final section of part 1 discusses \\nnew evidence on the relationship between food \\ninsecurity and various forms of malnutrition. \\n| 24 |box 4how do estimates of food insecurity compare to other important \\nindicators of human development?\\nnational prevalence estimates of moderate or severe \\nfood insecurity (fimod+sev) based on the fies rank \\ncountries in ways that are strongly correlated with the \\nrankings produced by other key indicators of human \\ndevelopment (see table below). as one would expect, \\ncountries with a lower prevalence of food insecurity \\nalso tend to have lower levels of poverty and income \\ninequality and higher labour force participation rates, \\ngdp per capita, literacy rates and gender equity. \\nadditionally, countries with a lower prevalence of food \\ninsecurity tend to have higher human capital indices, \\npointing to a strong link between food security and the \\nwell-being and development of nations.the table also shows that the prevalence of food \\ninsecurity is higher in countries with higher ratios of \\ndependents (people younger than 15 and older than \\n64) to the working-age population (age dependency \\nratio) and a larger percentage of the population \\nliving in rural areas. prevalence of food insecurity is \\nalso lower in countries with greater political stability \\nand less violence, a theme addressed in depth in the \\n2017 edition of this report. \\ncountries where health expenditure per capita \\nis lower, and where a larger proportion of the \\npopulation lacks access to safely managed water \\nand sanitation, also tend to be countries with a \\nhigher prevalence of food insecurity. access to these \\nhealth-related public services also has a strong effect \\non two key indicators of the state of a nation™s health \\nœ child mortality and life expectancy œ with which \\nnational prevalence of food insecurity are highly \\ncorrelated. child mortality tends to be higher and life \\nexpectancy lower in countries with higher rates of \\nfood

for different objectivesthe state of food security and nutrition in the world\\n and the global report on food crises\\n (grfc)1 are \\nboth multi-partnership efforts that provide assessments \\nof food security around the world which complement \\neach other. however, they have distinct objectives \\nand rely on different data and methodologies, so it is \\nimportant to clarify the difference between the numbers \\nthat these two reports provide.\\nwhile the grfc has a narrow focus on acute food \\ninsecurity for countries experiencing food crises, the \\nscope of this report is much broader: its objective is \\nto monitor food insecurity in the entire world, on a \\nregular basis. it is obvious, then, that the two reports \\nmust be informed by different types of data and \\nanalytic methods.all the indicators used for sdg monitoring and \\nreported here are arguably ill suited to reflect the \\nmost current conditions during emergencies, \\n a reason why current data for some of the countries \\nthat are experiencing conflicts are not reported in \\nthis report. however, that is not the purpose of the \\nreport. the two indicators used here to measure \\nhunger (pou and fisev), for example, are meant \\nto reliably capture long-term trends at global and \\nregional levels, while providing the best possible \\nassessment of the most recent structural situation at \\ncountry level. for this reason, they should not be \\ntoo conditioned by possibly temporary, short-term \\nfluctuations, typical of acute crises, which are the \\nmain focus of the indicators presented in the grfc.pou and fisev estimate the extent of severe food \\ndeprivation in a population, seen as a chronic \\ncondition, and are based on validated, official data \\nwhich are available with some delay due to various \\nrounds of cleaning and vetting. \\nthe grfc, on the other hand, focuses on \\nacute food insecurity and is mainly based on \\nanalytic approaches such as the integrated food \\nsecurity phase classification/cadre harmonisé\\n (ipc/ch). since timeliness is of the essence in \\ncrisis situations, rapid estimates are needed of \\nhow many people are facing crisis conditions or \\nworse (ipc/ch phase 3 or above), at the worst \\n(peak) moment in the year, based on all available \\nevidence, including non-official sources. \\nin other words, while chronic food insecurity as \\ncaptured by pou or fisev is a long-term or persistent \\ninability to meet food consumption requirements, \\nacute or transitory food insecurity as captured in \\ngrfc numbers is a short-term, possibly temporary, \\ninability to meet food consumption requirements \\nrelated to sporadic crises, conditions that can be \\nhighly susceptible to change and can manifest in a \\npopulation within a short time frame, as a result of \\nsudden changes or shocks.this is why this report\\'s estimates of the \\nnumber of undernourished people in the world \\nat 821.6 million in 2018 must not be directly \\ncompared with the figure of around 113 million \\npeople in 53 countries facing crisis conditions or \\nworse in 2018, as reported in the 2019 grfc.\\nhaving clarified that, however, it is worth \\nstressing again how the two reports are highly \\ncomplementary. acute and chronic food \\ninsecurity are not mutually exclusive phenomena. \\nindeed, repeated shocks and persistent crises can \\nprovoke upticks in severe food insecurity, eventually \\nforcing households into destitution and chronic \\npoverty, and potentially leading to starvation. \\nwhile acute food insecurity may require shorter-term \\ninterventions that address immediate causes, \\ninterventions tackling root causes may also be \\nimportant to prevent repeated transitory acute food

\\nthroughout the life cycle. among adults, obese \\npeople have higher rates of mortality due to an \\nincreased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer \\nand diabetes. children who are overweight are \\nat a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood \\npressure, asthma and other respiratory problems, \\nsleep disorders, and liver disease.\\n27 they may \\nalso suffer from the psychological effects of low \\nself-esteem, depression, and social isolation.\\n28 overweight and obesity during childhood \\noften persist into adulthood, leading to lifelong \\nhealth problems. the national economic costs, \\nresulting from increased healthcare costs and lost \\neconomic productivity, are tremendous.\\n29the definitions of overweight and obesity are \\nsomewhat different depending on the age group, \\nmaking comparisons between them difficult. \\nfor children under five, overweight is defined \\nas weight-for-height greater than 2 standard \\ndeviations above the who growth reference \\nstandard median. the term ﬁobesityﬂ is generally \\nnot used for children under five. for school-age \\nchildren and adolescents (aged 5œ19 years), \\nbeing overweight indicates having a body mass \\nindex (bmi)-for-age greater than 1 standard \\ndeviation above the who growth reference \\nstandard median, whereas obesity is defined as \\nhaving a bmi-for-age of more than 2 standard \\ndeviations above the median. in the case of \\nadults, overweight is defined as having a bmi \\ngreater than or equal to 25; likewise, obesity is \\ndefined as a bmi greater than or equal to 30. \\nfor this report, the term overweight is used to be \\ninclusive of obesity among school-age children, \\nadolescents and adults unless otherwise noted.\\nat its most basic level, overweight results \\nfrom a persistent condition of dietary energy \\nconsumption exceeding energy expenditure. \\nwhile genetics can increase an individual™s \\nsusceptibility to overweight, it cannot \\nexplain population-level increases over time. \\nintrauterine growth, infant feeding, and \\neating habits during preschool are significant \\ndeterminants of overweight and obesity \\nduring adulthood. there is increasing evidence \\nindicating the importance of good nutrition and \\nphysical activity in early life as a determinant \\nof long-term energy balance. unfortunately, \\nmodernization and economic development have \\nled to an increased availability of energy-dense \\nfoods and to poor dietary practices, while at the \\nsame time reducing levels of physical activity, \\na major determinant of energy expenditure. \\nfood security, i.e. access to nutritious and \\nsufficient food, is also known to be a key factor. \\nbox \\n6 provides a more in-depth description of the \\nlinks between maternal nutrition, malnutrition in \\nearly life and overweight later in life, illustrating \\nlife-cycle and intergenerational effects.\\nin 2018, an estimated 5.9 percent (40 million) \\nchildren under five were affected by overweight. \\nglobally in 2016, one in five school-age children \\n(20.6 percent) and adolescents (17.3 percent) \\nwere overweight, or 131 million children aged \\n5œ9 years and 207 million adolescents. in the \\nsame year, nearly two in five adults (38.9 percent) \\nwere overweight, representing 2 billion adults \\nworldwide (\\nfigure 17\\n). \\n  »| 31 |box 6overweight and obesity and the effect of malnutrition throughout \\n the life cyclean increased risk for overweight and obesity can be \\nimprinted early in life through intergenerational and \\nearly life influences; such influences have contributed \\nto a growing crisis in overweight since 2000, \\nas shown in figure 18. during foetal and early life, \\nundernutrition, potentially due to food insecurity, leads \\nto changes in physiology and metabolism that not only \\nstunt physical growth and negatively impact human \\ncapital, but also increase the risk of non-communicable \\ndiseases (ncds) later in life.1 to illustrate, there is \\nample evidence linking low birthweight to increased \\nrisks of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and \\nabdominal obesity.\\n2 the adverse effect of poor foetal \\ngrowth on ncd risk can be amplified by growth \\nfailure in the first years after birth and rapid weight \\ngain later in life.1 girls who experienced poor foetal \\ngrowth, especially when coupled with poor catch-up \\ngrowth during infancy, are more likely to become \\nstunted as adults and consequently more likely to give \\nbirth to low-birthweight babies, thus projecting \\n poor nutrition alongside increased ncd risk to the \\nnext generation.3 in addition to the link between early undernutrition \\nand subsequent risk of ncds, another mechanism \\nthat increases ncd and obesity risk along the life \\ncycle is that overweight or excess weight gain during \\npregnancy increases the risk of gestational diabetes \\nand large size at birth, which in turn is linked to \\nincreased risk of overweight and obesity later in life.\\n4 irrespective of birthweight, excessive weight gain in \\nearly childhood is predictive of overweight and obesity \\nin adolescence5 and adulthood.6 to effectively address \\nthe growing problem of overweight and obesity and to \\nprevent its perpetuation across generations, it is clear \\nthat a life-cycle approach is required that promotes \\naccess to nutritious foods, optimal infant feeding and \\nnutrition as well as healthy growth along the entire life \\ncourse, from foetal life to adulthood.pre-conceptionprenatalinfancy andearly childhoodincreased riskof overweightand obesityan increased risk of overweight and obesity can be imprinted early in lifethrough

and prenatal \\ncare, school health, and weight management.\\n33 it includes actions that are urgently needed \\nto address the problems of unhealthy diets \\nand inadequate physical activity found to be \\nprevalent among school-age children around \\nthe world (\\nbox 7\\n). finally, the comprehensive \\nimplementation plan for maternal, infant and \\nyoung child nutrition, endorsed by the world

policy sectors all have \\na role to play, as well as legislators and other \\npolitical leaders. a range of actions is needed, \\naimed at the individual, household, community, \\nnational and even global levels. \\nhealthcare systems must provide appropriate \\nsupport, education and counselling for \\nindividuals and families to promote breastfeeding \\n(starting with supportive policies in

nutritious \\nfoods, combined with nutrition education \\nand limiting exposure to foods or beverages \\nhigh in fats, sugars or salt and to marketing \\ncommunication for such foods in or around \\nschools. more broadly, transformation of food \\nsystems is essential in delivering safe, affordable \\nand sustainable diets. social protection \\nprogrammes can also support access to nutritious \\nfood especially for disadvantaged populations.\\npoorer communities often face physical and \\neconomic barriers to obtaining nutritious foods, \\nputting them at higher risk of food insecurity \\nand malnutrition. there is growing recognition \\nof the need for actions that address factors at the \\ncommunity and national levels.\\n37 governments \\nhave a range of policy options to choose

associated with \\nobesity in low- and middle-income countries; \\nsuch foods tend to be widely available in \\nupper-middle- and high-income countries, and \\nare often cheaper than fresh and nutritious \\nfoods.\\n42 to increase economic access to healthy \\ndiets, effective options are available to local and \\nnational governments, such as food assistance \\nprogrammes that provide low-income families \\nand individuals with supplemental funds to \\npurchase fruit and vegetables or promotion \\nof healthy food retail development through \\nfiscal incentives. some studies have shown \\nthat consumption of subsidized fruits and \\nvegetables can be increased in the range of 10 to \\n30 percent.\\n43 policymakers can also use economic \\nincentives such as taxes aimed at decreasing \\nthe demand for foods high in fat, sugar and/\\nor salt and subsidies to make nutritious foods \\nmore affordable.\\n44 taxes on sugar-sweetened \\nbeverages in particular have been found to \\nreduce purchases and/or consumption of these \\nproducts, not only due to the price increase, but \\nalso by raising awareness about the resulting \\nhealth benefits.\\n45 there is some evidence that the \\neffects of food taxes are stronger on low-income \\ngroups because they are more price-responsive, \\nand may therefore gain the most health benefits \\nœ especially if taxes are complemented with \\ntargeted subsidies for more nutritious foods.\\n46 furthermore, such taxes can also prompt \\nmanufacturers to reformulate their products (e.g. \\nby reducing sugar content).\\n47there are a number of other policy tools available \\nto national governments to promote healthy \\neating and prevent overweight and obesity. \\nthese include incentives to encourage fruit and \\nvegetable production, regulatory instruments that \\nshape nutrition labelling,\\n48 food standards and \\nappropriate procurement rules for schools and \\nother public institutions, and national food-based \\ndietary guidelines. provision of free access to safe \\nand affordable piped drinking water is crucial to \\npromoting health everywhere; easy accessibility \\nto safe piped drinking water in schools provides \\na healthy alternative to  the consumption of \\nsugar-sweetened beverages. other important \\npolicy measures include restrictions on \\nmarketing of breast-milk substitutes, regulation \\nof the marketing of foods and non-alcoholic \\nbeverages to children, and regulatory standards \\nfor maximum levels of salt, sugar and fat in \\nspecific products. government-led reformulation \\nprogrammes can lead to reductions in the levels \\nof salt, sugar and fat across the spectrum of \\nprocessed food and drink products, including the \\nelimination of industrially produced trans fats.\\n49 importantly, no single measure alone can reverse \\nthe overweight and obesity trends; rather, there \\nmust be a multifaceted approach that combines \\ndifferent types of policies and interventions. \\nthis section of the report has documented the \\npersistent challenge of undernutrition coupled \\nwith rising overweight and obesity, known \\nas the ﬁmultiple burden of malnutritionﬂ. \\nrecognizing that both the drivers and solutions \\nto the multiple facets of this burden are \\nintricately linked, ﬁdouble-duty actionsﬂ have \\nbeen identified that can address the problems \\nof undernutrition and obesity simultaneously.\\n50 the potential impact for double-duty actions \\nemerges from addressing the shared drivers \\nunderlying different forms of malnutrition, and \\nfrom shared platforms that can be used to address \\nthem. many of the policies outlined above are \\nexamples of such actions. for example, initiatives \\nto promote and protect breastfeeding can protect \\nagainst stunting and wasting in childhood, reduce \\nthe risk of overweight and obesity later in life, \\nand regulate maternal weight in the postpartum \\nperiod. school food and nutrition programmes \\ncan include the provision of meals to children \\nwho are food insecure while also ensuring \\nthat they are exposed to nutritious foods. \\nsocial protection programmes aimed at ensuring \\nfood security for vulnerable populations can be \\ndesigned in a manner which supports healthy \\neating habits and promotes dietary diversity. \\ndouble-duty actions thus offer integrated \\nsolutions that address the shared drivers of \\ndifferent forms of malnutrition in many different \\ncontexts, including the context of humanitarian \\nemergencies and protracted crises, where physical \\naccess to and affordability of nutritious foods \\nis often severely compromised. even in such \\ncontexts, where the priority is often to treat and \\nprevent undernutrition, these actions are needed \\nto combat the multiple burden of malnutrition by \\npromoting healthy diets (\\nbox 8\\n). \\n  »  »| 40 |box 8double-duty actions to address all forms of malnutrition in the context \\nof humanitarian assistance\\napproximately two billion people live in countries \\naffected by fragility, conflict and violence.\\n1 although \\nhumanitarian programmes must focus on saving lives \\nand providing food in sufficient quantities to protect \\nand promote food security, there is increasing \\nrecognition of the existence of multiple forms of \\nmalnutrition in crisis situations that must also be \\naddressed.2 the reality of the global distribution of different \\ntypes of malnutrition is complex.2 wasting and \\nstunting occur in both crisis and stable contexts, \\nand there is significant overlap in the risk factors for \\nand consequences of these forms of malnutrition.\\n3 simultaneously, there is growing awareness of the \\nshared drivers of obesity and undernutrition,\\n4 and the \\nexistence of diet-related non-communicable diseases in \\nhumanitarian contexts.5 this complexity demands an increase in focus on \\nall forms of malnutrition in both humanitarian and \\ndevelopment contexts. double-duty actions are needed, \\nwith a dual focus on meeting immediate needs and \\nreducing future risk and vulnerability. in order to design \\ncontext-specific programmes able to respond to the \\nmultiple burden of malnutrition, programme designers \\nand policymakers also need to make better use of \\ndata, with a focus on certain key questions: is there \\nan enabling environment for good nutrition in a given \\ncontext? is nutritious food available? can people afford \\nit? do they choose it? \\nhumanitarian actors currently use a variety \\nof approaches to protect food security, promote \\ngood nutrition and ultimately save lives. \\nconditional cash-based assistance, for example, \\ncan improve access to and affordability of nutritious \\nfoods, thus enabling vulnerable people, including \\nthose affected by crises, to improve their diets by \\npurchasing food through retail outlets. both the \\namount of cash relative to people™s needs, and \\npeople™s choices on how to use it, affect the potential \\nimpact that this cash can have on nutrition. in many \\ncontexts, a strong strategy for social and behavioural \\nchange communication may be required to ensure \\nthat cash is used to purchase nutritious food and does \\nnot contribute to an increased risk of overweight \\nand obesity.\\nin bangladesh for instance, e-vouchers distributed \\nto refugees for use in designated food outlets in camps \\nallow individuals to improve their diets through the \\npurchase of nutritious, fresh foods. e-vouchers provide \\naccess to 20 different food items, 12 of which are \\nmandatory (i.e. e-voucher recipients are required to \\npurchase these specific items) while the remaining \\n8 can be chosen from other food items that are \\navailable in the store. this approach helps to ensure \\nthe quality of the foods purchased while still respecting \\nindividual choices. guidelines set for retailers aim \\nat selling at least three items of fresh food including \\nfruits and vegetables. the financial support provided \\nthrough e-vouchers combined with nutrition education \\nand awareness-raising (e.g. on healthy diets and \\ncooking methods) is a strong example of a package \\nof double-duty interventions that can simultaneously \\naddress multiple forms of malnutrition.\\nalthough progress has been made in improving \\nthe affordability and accessibility of high-quality, \\nnutritious foods for vulnerable people, challenges \\npersist related to supply and demand. ongoing work \\nto strengthen local markets, improve efficiencies \\nin the retail sector, reduce the price of food while \\nmaintaining or increasing profitability, and utilize \\npoint-of-sale data to understand purchasing patterns, \\nare all double-duty actions than can help address \\nthe growing problem of the multiple burden of

restricted access to food, \\ni.e. food insecurity as measured by the fies, \\n is linked to different forms of malnutrition. \\n 1.3 \\n towards \\n an integrated \\nunderstanding of \\nfood security and \\nnutrition for health \\nand well-being key messages \\n countries with higher prevalence of moderate or \\nsevere food insecurity based on the fies tend to have \\nhigher rates of adult obesity, when controlling for \\nnational rates of undernourishment and poverty.\\n a closer look at household and individual level \\ndata from selected countries across all regions, reveals \\nthat food insecurity plays an important role as a \\ndeterminant of different forms of malnutrition. \\n in upper-middle- and high-income countries, living \\nin a food-insecure household is a predictor of obesity \\nin school-age children, adolescents and adults. \\n in low- and lower-middle-income countries, \\nhousehold food insecurity tends to be negatively \\nassociated with overweight and obesity, or is not \\nassociated at all.\\n children living in households classified as \\nmoderately or severely food insecure in a number \\nof countries in latin america and africa are more \\nlikely to be stunted compared with those living in \\nfood-secure households.\\nto accelerate progress towards ending \\nhunger and achieving food security and \\nimproved nutrition, as required by sdg 2, it \\nis important to fully grasp the connections \\nbetween food insecurity and malnutrition, \\nand the drivers underlying both. a better \\nunderstanding of these links can lead to more \\neffective policies aimed at addressing the \\nspecific challenges faced by countries and the \\ninternational community. as discussed in the \\npreceding section, forms of undernutrition \\nsuch as child stunting and anaemia in women \\nare persistent problems in many countries, \\nand countries of all income levels are seeing \\na rise in overweight and obesity. the total \\nnumber of obese people in the world (roughly \\n822 million, including overweight children \\nunder five, for whom obesity data are not \\navailable) surpassed the total number of \\nundernourished people (796.5 million, derived \\nfrom the pou) in 2016.\\n51moderate levels of food insecurity œ defined \\nas uncertain access to food of sufficient \\nquality and/or quantity, but not so extreme \\nthat it causes insufficient dietary energy \\nconsumption (undernourishment) œ can \\nincrease the risk of seemingly divergent \\nforms of malnutrition. the 2018 edition of the \\nreport\\n52 described multiple pathways whereby \\nfood insecurity may contribute to different \\nforms of malnutrition, including overweight \\nand obesity. household food insecurity can \\naffect the quantity and quality of dietary \\nintake, hence impacting on maternal nutrition, \\nchild growth and development and potentially \\nincreasing vulnerability to infectious diseases, \\nas well as the risk of anaemia in women. \\nmothers who are food insecure are also \\nmore stressed and likely to be depressed, \\nwhich can negatively affect breastfeeding \\nand care practices. other factors that help to \\nexplain the link between food insecurity and \\noverweight and obesity include the higher cost \\nof nutritious foods (and their substitution with \\ncheaper foods that are high in fats and sugar), \\nthe stress of living with uncertain access to \\nfood, and physiological adaptations to periodic \\nfood restrictions. \\nthis section presents new evidence on the \\nlinks between moderate or severe food \\n  »| 42 |insecurity and various forms of malnutrition. \\nthe analytic approach is two-pronged, but \\nconditioned by data availability. first, as \\nmeasures of the prevalence of food insecurity \\nand of the various forms of malnutrition in the \\nnational population exist for many countries, \\nthe analysis looks at whether the prevalence \\nof moderate food insecurity helps to explain \\ndifferences between countries in the prevalence \\nof adult obesity, overweight among school-age \\nchildren and adolescents, child stunting and \\nwasting, and anaemia in women. next, there is \\na more in-depth study of the role of household \\nfood insecurity in predicting malnutrition \\noutcomes in individuals using data at the micro \\nlevel from a limited number of countries in \\nafrica, asia and the americas.\\nlinks between food insecurity and various forms of malnutrition at the country level\\nthe top panel of \\ntable 5\\n reports the results of \\nthe spearman rank correlation coefficient \\nbetween the prevalence of moderate or severe \\nfood insecurity and that of each of the five \\nforms of malnutrition, across all countries \\nfor which both indicators are available at the \\nnational level.\\n53 the correlations between the prevalence \\nof moderate or severe food insecurity and \\nall nutrition outcomes are statistically \\nsignificant (p-values <˜0.01). the exception \\nis child wasting, where significance is only \\nmarginally below the 10 percent p-value. \\nthe correlation is negative for adult obesity, \\noverweight among both children and \\nadolescents, and positive for child stunting \\nand anaemia in women of reproductive age \\n(table 5\\n, top panel).\\nin other words, it appears that countries with \\na higher prevalence of moderate or severe food \\ninsecurity (combined) tend to have a lower \\nprevalence of child and adolescent overweight \\nand adult obesity and a higher prevalence of \\nanaemia and child stunting. such correlations, \\nhowever, could be spurious œ for example, they \\ncould be due to a correlation that exists, across \\ncountries, between the prevalence of moderate \\nor severe food insecurity and other aspects, \\nsuch as the incidence of poverty. to explore \\nwhether the detected link exists because \\nmoderate or severe food insecurity is relevant \\nper se\\n, and not simply a reflection of other \\nstructural indicators, a cross-country regression \\nanalysis was conducted for each of the nutrition \\noutcome indicators, against the prevalence of \\nmoderate or severe food insecurity, introducing \\nnational measures of undernourishment (as a \\nproxy for severe food insecurity) and extreme \\npoverty as controls.\\n54\\nthe results (\\ntable 5\\n, bottom panel) show that \\nwhen controls are included, the correlation \\nwith moderate or severe food insecurity \\nremains significant only for adult obesity œ \\nbut in reverse direction œ and for anaemia \\nin women. \\nthe reversal of the sign of the association \\nbetween moderate or severe food insecurity \\nand adult obesity, which becomes positive, \\nmeans that moderate food insecurity can indeed \\ncontribute to obesity, in certain conditions. \\nif one focuses attention on countries of similar \\nlevels of undernourishment and poverty, obesity \\nrates are higher in those where moderate food \\ninsecurity is also higher. this result is in line \\nwith the preliminary findings described in the \\n2017 report which showed how national rates of \\nfood insecurity were positively associated with \\nadult obesity in high- and upper-middle-income \\ncountries.\\n55 combined with the negative \\ncorrelation that is found for extreme poverty, \\nthis provides additional evidence of the fact \\nthat, as national economies grow, people facing \\ndifficulties in accessing food, as captured by an \\nexperience-based indicator of food insecurity, \\nhave a higher risk of obesity.\\n56this analysis presents a number of \\nlimitations due to the nature of the data \\nused, i.e. global data at the macro level. it is \\nclearly insufficient to fully account for the \\nreasons for the differential impact of food \\ninsecurity on adult obesity and other forms \\nof malnutrition in different conditions. \\nmore insights can be gained from analysis of \\ndata at the household and individual levels \\nthat combine measures of food insecurity \\nand of nutritional outcome, as explored in the \\nnext section.\\n| 43 |links between food insecurity and various forms of malnutrition at the household and individual levelsthis section presents the results of a statistical \\nanalysis of micro-level data obtained from \\nnationally representative surveys that included \\nmeasures of household food insecurity and \\nalso of nutritional outcomes of their members. \\nthe ultimate objective of the analysis was \\nto determine if living in a food-insecure \\nhousehold increases the probability of \\nbeing affected by one of the various forms \\nof malnutrition.\\nto ensure consistent measurement of food \\ninsecurity, one of the criteria used to select the \\nsurveys was that they should include either \\nthe fies or a similar experience-based tool to \\nmeasure household food insecurity, along with \\nthe nutritional outcome measures of individuals \\nin the household. although the number of \\nsuch surveys covering both food security at the \\nhousehold level and nutrition at the individual \\nlevel has increased, there are still too few \\nto be able to provide a global assessment. \\nnevertheless, the study provides useful \\nevidence from eight countries of diverse income \\nlevels from three main regions of the world.\\nas a preliminary step, the food-insecurity \\nmeasure in each survey was calibrated to \\nthe global reference scale following the fies \\nmethodology. this resulted in a measure that \\npermitted classification of each household \\nas being food secure or food insecure in a \\nconsistent way across the countries covered \\n(box 3\\n). then, logistic regressions of the \\nnutrition outcome condition were run at \\nthe individual level for each of the relevant \\npopulation groups, as a function of the \\nhousehold food-insecurity status, controlling \\nfor age, sex, socio-economic status, household \\nsize/dependency ratio, and urban/rural \\nresidence. for child malnutrition outcomes, \\n the analyses also controlled for maternal \\neducation and for access to clean drinking \\nwater and basic

food-insecure household either \\ndecreases the likelihood of being overweight \\nor obese (kenya and pakistan) or has a very \\nweak (malawi) or no association (nepal and \\nnigeria). in upper-middle- and high-income \\ncountries (brazil, mexico and the united \\nstates of america), food insecurity increases \\nthe likelihood of being overweight or obese, \\nat least in some age groups. in brazil, food \\ninsecurity is statistically correlated with \\nobesity in the two age groups considered \\n(p-value˜<˜0.05), while in the united states \\nof america and mexico the statistical \\nsignificance of the association is strong \\n(p-value < 0.01) for adults. the association \\nfor obesity in school-age children and \\nadolescents is less strong for the united \\nstates and not statistically significant at the \\nconventional significance levels for mexico \\n(p-value˜=˜0.117). although this analysis was \\nnot designed to prove the hypothesis, the \\ndifferent direction of the association of food \\ninsecurity with adult obesity depending on the \\nincome level of the country is consistent with \\nother evidence that a positive relationship \\nis more likely in settings where highly \\nprocessed, energy-dense foods are low-cost.\\n59 as mentioned in section 1.2, in upper-middle- \\nand high-income countries, such foods are \\nubiquitously available and cheap, while fresh, \\nnutritious foods are often out of reach for \\nthose living on lower incomes. but in many \\nlow- and lower-middle-income countries,

number of hungry people \\nis growing, albeit slowly. at the same time, \\nreductions in child stunting are insufficient to \\nmeet global goals, and obesity and overweight \\nare on the rise. \\nprevious editions of this report have identified \\nthree drivers behind these problematic trends: \\nconflict, climate and economic slowdowns. \\nthese drivers are complex and often interact \\nwith compounding effects that challenge \\nfood security and nutrition in multiple ways. \\nunless greater and more targeted efforts \\nare made to address these drivers and the \\nunderlying causes of hunger and malnutrition, \\nit is increasingly clear that the goal of ending \\nhunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 \\nwill not be achieved.\\nin 2017, this report made it clear that \\nefforts to fight hunger and malnutrition in \\nconflict-affected situations must go hand in \\nhand with actions for immediate humanitarian \\nassistance and long-term development that \\nbuilds resilience and helps sustain peace. \\nin 2018, the report called for urgent action \\nto scale up and accelerate policies and \\nprogrammes to build climate resilience. \\nthis year, this second part of the report looks \\nmore closely at how the third key driver, \\neconomic slowdowns œ and, more specifically, \\nalso economic downturns œ has contributed to the \\nrecent rise in hunger with possible implications \\nfor nutrition. this is critical to understanding \\nfuture trends in hunger and malnutrition, \\nespecially given the dark predictions of the \\nlatest global economic prospects, with slowing \\nand stalled economic growth in many countries, \\nincluding emerging and developing economies. \\nindeed, episodes of financial stress, elevated \\ntrade tensions and tightening financial conditions \\nare all contributing to bleaker global economic \\nprospects.\\n1importantly, the impact of economic slowdowns \\nand downturns on food security and nutrition \\ncannot be separated from the root causes of \\nhunger and malnutrition: poverty, inequality and \\nmarginalization. part 2 therefore looks closely \\nat the relationship between poverty and food \\nsecurity and nutrition, and how they interact \\nwith inequality and marginalization to threaten \\nfood security and nutrition. \\nthe purpose of the analysis is to provide \\nguidance on how these challenges can be \\novercome to end hunger and malnutrition in \\nall its forms. the last section thus presents \\npolicies and programmes that can protect the \\nmost vulnerable from the impact of economic \\nslowdowns and downturns, while fostering food \\nsecurity and nutrition from a perspective of \\nmore inclusive economic growth. ending hunger \\nand malnutrition by 2030 (sdg targets 2.1 and \\n2.2) will require greater efforts and integrated \\napproaches to eradicate extreme poverty (sdg˜1), \\nensure decent work and inclusive economic \\ngrowth (sdg 8), and reduce inequalities \\n(sdg˜10). \\nsustained escapes from food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition\\n in the face of economic \\nslowdowns and downturns \\npart 2\\n| 50 | 2.1\\n  economic \\nslowdowns and

rising \\nglobal borrowing costs.\\n hunger has been on the rise in countries where the \\neconomy has slowed down or contracted. the uneven \\npace of global economic recovery raises concerns \\nregarding prospects for ending hunger and \\nmalnutrition in all its forms. \\n most countries (84 percent) that experienced a rise \\nin undernourishment between 2011 and 2017 \\nsimultaneously suffered an economic slowdown or \\ndownturn œ and the majority of these are \\nmiddle-income countries.\\n while conflict and climate shocks were the key \\ndrivers of food crises in 2018, economic shocks were \\nsignificant secondary and tertiary drivers in more than \\nhalf of the countries affected by food crises and \\nworsened the severity of these food crises for \\n96˜million people.\\n rises in the prevalence of undernourishment in \\ncountries that faced economic downturns tend to be \\nhigher (5.1 percentage points) than countries \\nvulnerable to climate extremes (2.3 percentage points \\nhigher) and countries that experienced conflict \\n(2.2 percentage points higher).\\nhow are economic slowdowns and downturns relevant to the quest to eradicate hunger and malnutrition? hunger has been on the rise in many countries \\nwhere the economy has slowed down or \\ncontracted. between 2011 and 2017, this \\nincrease coincided with an economic slowdown \\nor downturn in 65 out of 77 countries. \\neconomic shocks that typically result in economic \\nslowdowns or downturns tend to be significant \\nsecondary and tertiary drivers that prolong and \\nworsen the severity of food crises, especially \\nin countries experiencing acute food insecurity \\nrequiring urgent humanitarian assistance.\\n2 in \\n2018, economic shocks featured prominently in \\n33 out of the 53 countries that suffered from food \\ncrises, affecting more than 96 million people \\n(table 8\\n).an economic slowdown generally means \\neconomic activity is sluggish, although it \\ncontinues to grow. when there is no growth, \\nthe economy has reached a downturn (\\nbox 9\\n). \\nthese economic phenomena often lead to a rise \\nin unemployment and decline in wages and \\nincomes, challenging access to food and essential \\nsocial services for the poor. people™s access to \\nhigh-quality, nutritious food, which tends to be \\nless affordable œ especially for poor people who \\nspend a large portion of their income on food œ \\ncan be affected, as can access to basic services \\nsuch as health care. \\nthe state of food security and nutrition in the world \\n2019\\n| 51 |the uneven pace of global economic recovery \\nfrom slowdowns further raises concerns \\nregarding prospects for ending hunger and \\nmalnutrition in all its forms. recent world \\neconomic reports highlight that slowdowns, \\nstagnation and outright recessions are evident \\nin several economies and already leading \\nto increased unemployment and declines in \\nincome.\\n3 there may soon be yet another global \\neconomic downturn. early this year, the imf \\nrevised\\n˜its forecast for global growth to the \\nlowest level since the global financial crisis a \\ndecade ago, as the outlook dimmed in most \\n major economies.\\n4 this dark outlook reflects increasing risks \\nrelated to rising trade tensions, weakening \\ninvestments, increasing government and \\ncorporate debt, and rising borrowing costs. \\naccording to the world bank, further escalation \\nof trade tensions and the associated uncertainty \\ncould weaken growth even further.\\n5 moreover, \\nthe outlook for commodity prices, especially \\noil, is vulnerable to policy-related risks and \\nthe collective intervention of many countries œ\\nparticular through trade policies œ may amplify \\ninternational price movements, and may not \\nbe effective in protecting the most vulnerable \\npopulations groups.\\n6trade tensions, which are increasingly taking \\na toll on business confidence, are a particular \\nconcern. after strong growth in 2017 and \\n2018, the global economy™s slowdown reflects \\na confluence of factors, including usœchina \\ntrade tensions. global trade has also slowed \\nconsiderably. moreover, escalation and tariff \\nhikes between the two largest economies of the \\nworld could further weaken growth and put \\npressure on the price of commodities. this is \\nbecause higher tariffs will increase the price of \\nimported goods, disrupt global value chains, \\none of the primary measures used to gauge the health \\nof a country™s economy is gross domestic product \\n(gdp). often referred to as the size of the economy, \\n it is the total value of economic activity within a \\ncountry measured as the total value of goods and \\nservices produced during a given period of time. \\nthe economic growth rate is the percentage increase \\nor decrease of gdp from one period to another. \\nan economic slowdown is when economic activity \\nis growing at a slower pace. in other words, there still \\nis growth in economic activity, but at a slower rate than \\nbefore. an economic slowdown occurs when real gdp \\ngrowth declines from one period of time to another but \\nis still positive, usually measured in quarters of a year. \\nan economic downturn\\n is when there is no growth, \\nbut rather a period of decline in economic activity. \\nit refers to a period of economic contraction or \\nnegative economic growth as measured by the growth \\nrate in real gdp. an \\neconomic recession,1 often used \\nsynonymously with economic downturn\\n, is a temporary \\nor short-term downturn in economic growth, usually \\noccurring over at least two consecutive quarters of \\ndecline. stagnation is period where an economy grows \\nat an extremely low rate without actually entering \\na recession.an economic shock is an unexpected or \\nunpredictable event that is external to the specific \\neconomy and can either harm or boost it. a global \\nfinancial crisis causing bank lending or credit to fall, \\nor an economic downturn in a major trading partner \\nof a country, reflect demand-side shocks that can \\nhave multiple effects on spending and investment. \\na steep rise in oil and gas prices, natural disasters \\nthat result in sharp falls in production, or conflict \\nthat disrupts trade and production, are examples of \\nsupply-side shocks. \\nsee annex 3 for the full definitions used in the \\nanalysis of this report, as well as the methodology \\napplied in the measuring of economic slowdowns \\nand

\\npeople undernourished in the world as a whole \\ndeclined steadily from 2005 to 2015 (figure 1). \\nthe global food crisis of 2007œ2008 and the global \\nfinancial crisis of 2008œ2009 occurred in between. \\nso how was this possible? \\nthese crises were preceded by a period of \\nsustained economic growth in the world (figure 22), \\nincluding in different developing regions, which \\nare home to millions of undernourished people and \\npeople affected by malnutrition. subsequently, the \\nglobal economic downturn in latin america and the \\ncaribbean, north america and europe, and slowdown \\nin other regions during 2008œ2009 was short lived \\nand the world economy started to grow again in 2010. \\nwhile this refers to aggregate trends for the world and \\nacross regions, it is still interesting to see that only nine \\ncountries witnessed the simultaneous occurrence of an \\neconomic slowdown or downturn and an increase in \\nthe pou during these crises (figure 24).in addition to growth, other factors came \\ninto play to prevent an increase in the number of \\nundernourished people during these crises. during the \\nglobal food crisis, for example, international food \\nprices increased sharply between 2007 and early \\n2008, reaching their highest level in the summer of \\n2008.1 many countries responded to the food price \\nsurge with policies softening the pass-through of \\ninternational prices on markets and households\\n2 œ a \\ntransmission mechanism explained later in this report. \\nthere is evidence that the increase in domestic prices \\nwas significantly lower and that domestic prices were \\nalso less volatile than world prices.3 furthermore, \\nfaostat data show that the production of cereals \\nincreased in low- and middle-income countries during \\nthe global food crisis. this may also have been an \\nimportant factor mediating the increase in domestic \\nprices and contributing to employment creation and \\nimprovements in food security.\\nan additional explanation would be the coping \\nmechanisms of net food-consuming households. \\na cross-country analysis of how families coped with \\nthe high food price crisis shows relatively large \\nincreases in dietary energy consumption among the \\nhighest income quintiles in urban areas in guatemala, \\nhonduras and nicaragua. this indicates that \\nhouseholds were consuming more energy-dense foods \\nsuch as street foods or fast foods instead of more \\nnutritious, diversified but costly diets. while these \\ncoping mechanisms of households help maintain overall \\ndietary energy reduction, they may affect nutrition with \\nlong-term and potentially intergenerational negative \\neffects on health and productivity.\\n4 the global financial crisis, on the other hand, \\noriginated as a result of a financial ﬁmeltdownﬂ in \\ndeveloped countries with serious implications for the \\nreal economy, affecting several parts of the world. \\nhowever, with the exception of transition countries in \\ncentral and eastern europe, financial institutions in \\ndeveloping countries were not affected by ﬁfinancial \\ncontagionﬂ. developing countries™ banks did not \\nhold ﬁcontaminatedﬂ assets (i.e. those including \\nsub-prime mortgages). therefore, the major channels \\nof transmission were through trade and financial \\nflows between developed and developing countries. \\nthe effects were short lived considering the resumption \\nof economic growth in 2010 (figure 22).many developing countries took advantage \\nof the period of sustained economic growth \\npreceding the crisis to implement fiscal and \\neconomic reforms. following the latin american \\nand asian crises of the 1990s, several countries \\nhad carried out macroeconomic reforms to make \\ntheir economies more resilient to shocks, including \\ncloser bank supervision and reserve accumulation. \\nmany countries were also able to implement policies \\naimed at reducing or neutralizing antisocial effects \\nof economic cycles, such as policies encouraging \\nspending during downturns œ also known as \\ncountercyclical policies. using a sample of 33 low- \\nand middle-income countries, a study shows that \\nthe majority of these (20 countries) increased public \\nsocial expenditure relative to total public expenditure \\nduring the global financial crisis.5 although hunger declined steadily during both \\nthe global food crisis and financial crisis, not only \\nfor the world but also across developing regions \\n(see table 1\\n in part 1 for changes in the pou between \\n2005 and 2010), it is likely that the state of food \\nsecurity and nutrition did change in some countries6 and some population groups may have experienced \\nincreased hunger or malnutrition. the variation \\nmay not have been reflected in the numbers at \\nthe national level, however, as probably only the \\n| 56 |only increased in a handful of countries during \\ntwo consecutive crises: the global food crisis and \\nthe global financial crisis (for explanations of \\nthis, see \\nbox 10\\n).the greatest number of countries where rising \\nundernourishment occurred while the economy \\nslowed down or stagnated are in africa (32). \\nseveral are in asia (17), followed by latin \\namerica and the caribbean (11), oceania (3) \\n and eastern europe (2). the majority of them \\n (44 out of 65) are middle-income countries; \\n19˜(out of 65) are low-income countries, of which \\n17 are located in africa with the exception of \\ntajikistan and yemen. \\nnotably, 80 percent of the countries (52˜out \\nof 65) that experienced an increase in \\nundernourishment while their economy slowed \\ndown or contracted depend highly on food and \\nfuel commodity imports and/or oil and other \\nprimary commodity exports for foreign exchange \\nand tax revenue generation (see annex 6 for \\nlist of countries by commodity dependence).\\n14 as noted above, world prices are one of the \\ninternational factors that can contribute to the \\ndeterioration of a country™s economic state. \\na sharp and persistent reduction of commodity \\nprices affects commodity-dependent countries, \\ntriggering a number of economy-wide effects, \\nincluding reductions in foreign exchange and tax \\nrevenue, with potentially adverse impacts on food \\nsecurity and nutrition. \\nto provide statistical evidence that the relationship \\nbetween changes in undernourishment and \\neconomic slowdowns and downturns is more than \\na simple corresponding occurrence, a regression \\nanalysis comparing the difference in the pou and \\nthe real gdp per capita growth between 2011 and \\n2017\\n15 was carried out. it points to a statistically \\nsignificant correlation between the two (see \\nannex 4 for model and results). on average, a ten \\npercent decrease in economic growth between \\n2011 and 2017 corresponds to a 1.5 percentage \\npoint increase in the pou between 2011 and 2017. \\nfurthermore, countries that have experienced \\neconomic downturns show significant increases \\nin the pou between 2011 and 2017, equal to \\n5.1 percentage points higher than countries with \\neconomies that have not contracted.\\nthe correlation, as expected, varies from country \\nto country. on average, low-income countries \\nmost vulnerable households before the two crises, \\nexperienced food insecurity during these crises, \\n as studies for some countries show.\\n6 some national \\nreports also point to increased prevalence of \\ndifferent forms of malnutrition in certain population \\ngroups: in china, for example, the prevalence \\nof stunting among infants7 in poorer rural areas \\nincreased between 2008 and 2010.8  1 for more details on the

25\\n and \\ntable a4.2\\n in annex 4).\\nit is also important to explore the interaction \\nbetween economic downturns with the two other \\ndrivers of the rising trend in hunger: conflict \\nand climate. economic downturns show the \\nhighest correlation with increases in pou in \\nterms of magnitude of the estimated coefficient, \\nalmost double that of vulnerability to climate \\nand conflict. in fact, countries with economic \\ndownturns have a 5.1 percentage point higher \\npou than countries without, whereas countries \\nwith vulnerability to climate and conflict have \\na 2.3 and 2.2 percentage point higher pou, \\nrespectively (see \\ntable a4.3\\n in annex 4).\\nwhen pou increases are estimated within \\nincome groups, upper-middle-income countries \\nwith economic downturns show the highest \\npou increase, i.e. a 6.3 percentage point higher \\npou increase between 2011 and 2017 than \\nupper-middle-income countries without economic \\ndownturns. on the contrary, low-income \\ncountries are those with the highest pou increase \\nassociated with climate vulnerability and conflict. \\nthese countries experience a 4.8 percentage point \\nhigher pou increase in the presence of climate \\nvulnerability compared to low-income countries \\nwithout and, when affected by conflict, they report \\na 5.5 percentage point higher pou (see \\n tables a4.4a\\n and \\nb in annex 4). first, this is in line \\nwith studies suggesting that conflicts are more \\nlikely to erupt in low-income economies, leading to \\nthe most dangerous increases in hunger.\\n16 second, \\nlow-income countries are the only countries that \\nexperience a significant pou increase associated \\nwith vulnerability to climate (see \\ntables a4.4a\\n and \\nb in \\nannex 4). quite importantly, this result deriving \\nfrom a macro-level analysis, confirms extensive \\nfindings from the microeconomic literature œ \\nthat climate extremes have a disproportionately \\nnegative effect on the poorest populations living \\nin remote areas in terms of consumption and \\nfood security.\\n17 although a correlation analysis \\ndescribes the association between the three \\ndrivers and the change in pou, it is difficult to \\ndisentangle the contribution of each of the three \\ndrivers, given that conflict and climate shocks \\ncan also affect economic growth, and therefore \\nindirectly affect undernourishment.\\neconomic slowdowns and downturns  worsen global food crises countries experiencing crisis levels of acute food \\ninsecurity also typically experience economic \\ndisarray. in the last three years (2016œ2018), \\nmore than 100 million people every year \\nhave faced periods of acute food insecurity.\\n18 in˜2018, 113 million people across 53 countries \\nand territories faced c\\nrisis\\n levels of acute food \\ninsecurity or worse (ipc phase 3 and above or \\nequivalent)\\n19 where urgent humanitarian actions \\nwere needed to save lives and livelihoods, \\nas well as to address high or above-average \\nacute malnutrition. \\nanalysis of acute food insecurity, including the \\ndrivers behind the food crisis, carried out at \\nthe country level, sheds light on how economic \\nslowdowns and downturns worsen food crises.\\n20 it shows that, in 2018, conflict remained the key \\ndriver of food crises, affecting around 74 million \\npeople, two-thirds of whom faced acute food \\ninsecurity. climate and natural disasters were \\nthe primary driver of acute food insecurity for \\nanother 29 million people. economic shocks were \\nthe primary driver of acute food insecurity for \\n10.2 million people.\\nwhile economic shocks are rarely the primary \\ndrivers of food crises, they are significant \\nsecondary or tertiary drivers of them. in many \\ninstances, significant economic shocks œ or even \\nnot-so-significant shocks that occur in fragile \\neconomies œ can undermine economic activity, \\nworsen the severity of acute food insecurity, \\nand prolong the duration of the crisis. in fact, \\nmore than 96 million people in 33 countries who \\nsuffered from acute food insecurity in 2018 lived \\nin places where the economy was undergoing \\neconomic shocks of rising unemployment, lack \\nof regular work, currency depreciation and high \\nfood prices

especially in \\ncountries facing economic downturns (\\ntable 8\\n).as the next section shows, persistent slowdowns \\nand sharp downturns in the economy can drain \\nforeign currency reserves, potentially triggering \\nnational currency depreciations with a number of \\nknock-on effects detrimental to food security and \\nnutrition, including food price inflation. this is \\nespecially the case for countries dependent \\non food imports. seventy-five percent of the \\ncountries with food crises that also suffered from \\neconomic shocks are net food importers (25 out \\nof 33) with the value of food imports outweighing \\nthe country™s value of food exports.\\neconomic slowdowns and downturns can \\nconstrain national financial capacities to provide \\nessential services, protect the poor and respond \\neffectively to crises. furthermore, political \\ninstability limits the capacity of governments to \\nsupport their populations during food crises, and \\ntherefore economic downturns, especially if they \\nare severe, can further compound the impacts of \\nthis instability on food crises. \\neconomic slowdowns and downturns can also \\nlower the resilience capacity of households to \\nrespond to other shocks œ including climate \\nshocks. for example, the climatic impact of el \\nniño in southern africa in 2016 led to more \\nthan 12 million food-insecure people in need \\nof urgent humanitarian action in six countries. \\nthe impact of this phenomenon was intensified \\nby already ongoing economic slowdowns and \\ndownturns in several countries, which weakened \\nhouseholds™ capacity to respond effectively to \\nthe climate shock and contributed to lowering \\nthe resilience of households already debilitated \\nby a poor agricultural season in 2015. this was \\nthe case for eswatini (formerly swaziland), \\nmozambique and zimbabwe. while households \\nmay be able to cope with and recover from \\ntransitory shocks, multiple and recurring \\nshocks are increasingly the norm, adding to \\nthe vulnerability of the poor. aggregate and \\nrecurring shocks tend to result in poverty traps \\nor slips back into poverty, generating harmful \\neffects on present food security and nutrition, \\nand on future generations.\\n25  2.2\\n  commodity \\ndependence and its \\nrelevance for food \\nsecurity and \\nnutrition \\n key messages \\n eighty percent of the countries (52 out of 65) with \\na rise in hunger during recent economic slowdowns \\nand downturns are countries whose economies are \\nhighly dependent on primary commodities for export \\nand/or import. \\n in 2018, 807˜million undernourished people and \\n154˜million stunted children under the age of five lived \\nin low- and middle-income countries: of these, \\nrespectively, around 381˜million and 73˜million lived \\nin high commodity-dependent countries. the latter \\nalso were home to almost 109˜million out of the \\n113˜million people facing crisis levels of acute food \\ninsecurity requiring urgent humanitarian actions. \\n changes in commodity prices affect the relative \\nvalue of exports and imports in these countries. \\nforeign exchange drains, depreciation and \\ndevaluation of currencies may pass through the \\neconomic system, resulting in rising domestic prices, \\nunemployment, loss of wages, and consequently loss \\nof incomes. \\n these events pose macroeconomic aggregate \\nshocks affecting multiple households, rather than \\nidiosyncratic shocks that only affect a single \\nhousehold. many vulnerable households see their \\npurchasing power reduced, while coping strategies \\nthey use during idiosyncratic once-off shocks are \\nnot effective.\\n the need to change consumption patterns can \\nlead vulnerable households to cut spending on a \\nrange of basic services for health and disease \\nprevention or shift away from nutrient-rich foods \\ntowards more energy-dense but nutrient-poor foods. \\nhouseholds may also see the supply of basic services \\ncompromised if the fiscal space to provide essential \\nsocial public expenditure becomes more limited. \\n| 61 |commodity price trends and boomsinternational, regional and national factors can \\nharm economic activity in ways that challenge \\nfood security and nutrition. understanding \\nthe mechanisms through which economic \\nslowdowns and downturns contribute to the \\nrecent, unwelcoming trends in food security \\nand nutrition can be approached from different \\nangles as it is ultimately country-specific. \\nhowever, there is a steady trend affecting \\nmany of the countries where hunger is lately on \\nthe rise.\\nlow- and middle-income countries are, by and \\nlarge, well integrated with the world economy, \\nthough to different degrees and in different \\nways. they trade goods and services with other \\ncountries, invest in them or receive investors \\nfrom them, and exchange different types of \\nflows, including financial capital, foreign aid, \\nforeign borrowing, remittances and others. \\nthis integration, of course, exposes them to \\nexternal vulnerabilities depending on the \\nstructural features of their economies. \\nin this regard, a key vulnerability arises relating \\nto what these countries produce and what they \\ntrade with the rest of the world: essentially, \\nprimary commodities. the trend in rising \\ncommodity prices that started in 2003 and \\nthe period of extreme price volatility in 2008 \\nhave been followed by largely declining global \\ncommodity prices for five consecutive years from \\n2011 to 2016 (\\nfigure 26\\n). as a result, commodity \\nprices fell by more than nine percent in this \\nperiod. as indicated earlier, global commodity \\ndemand is also in decline and the outlook is \\nthat its growth could slow over the next decade, \\nespecially for agriculture and metals.\\nalthough global commodity price levels are still \\nhigher than during the pre-commodity price \\nboom in 2007œ2008, most countries that are \\nhighly dependent on exporting commodities to \\ngenerate revenues have not been able to use their \\ncommodity windfalls during commodity price \\nbooms to diversify their economies and reduce \\ntheir vulnerability to price shocks. today many \\nare as commodity dependent as before, if not \\nmore so, with few exceptions such as argentina, \\nchina and mexico.\\n26 there are many reasons \\nfor this. diversification and upgrading of the \\nproductive structures and capabilities from \\nwhich wealth is created and distributed are not \\neasy tasks and take years to achieve.\\n27 effective \\npolicies, effective collaboration between public \\nand private sectors, and high levels of investment \\nare also needed. \\nfurthermore, benefits during boom periods \\nare by far outweighed by the negative impacts \\ncaused by price volatility and low-price \\nperiods, which tend to be longer than boom \\nperiods.\\n28 moreover, the negative impacts on \\nnet food importers during periods of high food \\nprices can be extremely severe, as witnessed \\nduring the food price crises of 2007˚2008 and \\n2010˚2012. \\nwhy does commodity dependence matter? commodity dependence matters because it \\nincreases the vulnerability of countries to world \\nprice swings. the vulnerability to changing \\ncommodity prices arises as countries produce and \\ntrade commodities and, in most cases, low- and \\nmiddle-income countries are world price-takers \\nthat cannot affect them. they may not be in \\na position to influence these prices alone. \\nthey may also not be in a position to undergo \\nthe structural transformation to move them away \\nfrom commodity dependence. \\nthe association between economic performance \\nand commodity prices in commodity-dependent \\ncountries is strong and therefore makes them \\nespecially vulnerable to the volatility of global \\ncommodity prices.\\n29 recent slowdowns and \\ndownturns in economic growth in many regions \\nare largely explained by marked declines in \\ncommodity prices. this is mainly affecting \\ncountries dependent on primary commodity \\nexports, particularly in south america, but also \\nother regions including asia and some countries \\nin africa.\\n30countries from these regions are commodity-\\n export-dependent as they derive the bulk \\nof their export earnings from primary \\ncommodities. this report not only focuses on \\nthis type of countries, but also on countries \\nshowing commodity-import dependence and \\nnet food-import dependence (see \\nbox 11\\n for \\n| 62 |definitions). commodity-import-dependent \\ncountries have a high ratio of food and fuel \\nimports to total merchandise trade, while \\ncommodity-export-dependent countries derive \\nthe bulk of their export earnings from primary \\ncommodities. net food importers are countries \\nwhere the value of imports of basic foodstuffs \\noutweighs the value of food exports. out of a \\ntotal of 134 low- and middle-income countries \\nstudied for the period 1995œ2017, 102 countries \\nare classified according to the three types of high \\ncommodity dependence, whereas the remaining \\n32 are low commodity dependent. \\nhigh commodity-dependent countries exhibit \\ncombinations of commodity-import and -export \\ndependence, which entail different vulnerabilities \\nto commodity prices and links with food security \\nand nutrition. for example, out of 134 low- and \\nmiddle-income countries in the period 1995œ2017, \\n34

\\nthe pou in the presence of commodity dependence.\\nthe same fao study also finds that, when \\ncommodity-import dependence is unpacked, \\nfood-import dependence has a bigger and stronger \\neffect on the pou than fuel-import dependence. \\nfood-import dependence is associated with an \\n8 percent increase in pou per year on average, \\nwhereas fuel-import dependence does not report a \\nstatistically significant coefficient. \\nthe two successive and sharp commodity price \\nbooms in 2007œ2008 and 2010œ2011 offered an \\neconomic bonanza to most commodity-export-\\ndependent countries (\\nfigure 26\\n and \\n28). many \\nregistered a large increase in export revenues \\nand generally saw increased economic growth. \\nfor net food importers and high commodity-\\nimport-dependent countries, however, such \\nprice booms can create additional challenges \\nfor food security and nutrition. this can \\nparticularly be the case for net buyers of food \\nthrough imported food price inflation. on the \\nother hand, high food prices, especially cereal \\nprices, can be a strong incentive for increased \\nagricultural production, whereby the positive \\neffects of this outweigh the negative effects of \\nhigh food prices (e.g. for net buyers of food) \\nwith overall positive net effects on food security \\nand nutrition. this was the case in many \\ncountries during the 2007œ2008 global food \\ncrisis (\\nbox 10\\n). \\nnew fao evidence suggests that economic \\ngrowth, even if strong during price booms for \\nhigh commodity-export-dependent countries, \\ndoes not necessarily translate into improved food \\nsecurity and nutrition.\\n33 this study finds that, \\nduring the period 1995œ2017, both food-import \\ndependence and export dependence on primary \\ncommodities have a negative effect on pou, even \\nwhen controlling for the price booms between \\n2003 and 2011 (excluding the sharp commodity \\nprice drop in 2008œ2009, see

requires a thorough understanding \\nof the potential effects. these effects are \\nmediated through a number of direct and \\nindirect channels that link global commodity \\nmarkets with domestic economic, social and \\nhuman development outcomes, including \\nfood security and nutrition. the transmission \\nchannels in such contexts are complex, and \\na given commodity price change does not \\naffect all commodity-dependent countries in a \\nuniform manner. \\nfigure \\n29 presents a simplified \\noverview of these transmission channels.\\n the transmission channels can be grouped into \\nfour broad areas, which are the main subject of \\nanalysis in this section. they are:\\n direct impacts\\n emanating as the change \\nin commodity prices affects terms of trade, \\nexchange rate adjustments and the balance \\nof payments. \\n secondary indirect effects of these \\nmacroeconomic impacts on:\\n domestic prices, including food;\\n unemployment, declining wages and loss of \\nincome; and\\n health and social services.\\nultimately, an important critical factor that \\ndetermines whether the direct and indirect \\nimpacts affect food security and nutrition is the \\nability of individuals and households to cope \\nwith these economic-related shocks. the last part \\nof this section takes a closer look at how people \\ncope and when their coping capacities fail. \\nterms of trade, exchange rate and balance \\n of payments macroeconomic performance in commodity-dependent \\ncountries tends to move with commodity price \\ncycles. economic activity and growth and external \\nand fiscal balances deteriorate/improve during \\ncommodity price downswings/upswings, whether \\nthe latter entail long periods of falling/rising \\ncommodity prices or shorter commodity price \\nswings that last only few years.\\n36 from the perspective of low-income countries, \\nespecially those where the principal means of \\nforeign exchange earnings come from the exports \\nof primary commodities, unstable commodity \\nprices create macroeconomic instabilities and \\ncomplicate macroeconomic management (\\nfigure 29\\n).terms of trade shocks and volatility \\nsharp declines or increases in international \\nprimary commodity prices can lead to \\nchanges in the terms of trade (tot) for \\ncommodity-dependent countries. that is to say, \\nthe ratio between the prices at which a country \\nsells its exports and the prices it pays for its \\nimports is affected. a reduction in this ratio \\nreflects a deterioration in the tot which can have \\nimplications on economic growth, with further \\neconomy-wide implications as both supply and \\ndemand factors respond to the shock. \\nin fact, tot shocks have been shown to carry \\nthe highest economic output costs among a \\nrange of external shocks for a large number of \\ndeveloping countries.\\n37 low-income countries \\nare especially vulnerable. the imf has found \\nthat low-income countries are almost six times \\nmore often affected by severe tot fluctuations \\nand changes than developed countries.\\n38world economic reports confirm that sharp and \\ncontinuous declines in international commodity \\nprices from 2011 to 2016 led to substantial shifts \\nin the tot and a sharp deterioration of gdp \\ngrowth in commodity-dependent countries.\\n39 of course, the extent to which a variation in the \\nexport or import price of a commodity affects \\nthe tot will depend on the relative share of the \\ncommodity in the country™s total exports and \\nimports, as well as on the magnitude of the price \\nshock. similar variations in export and import \\nprices may also offset one another.\\n| 68 |most fuel and mineral exporters (e.g. congo, \\n gabon, nigeria, zambia) witnessed a \\ndeterioration of their tot as a result of the price \\ndeclines between april 2011 and august 2015.\\n40 this, combined with the depreciation in their \\nexchange rates and a loss of commodity revenue, \\nled to deteriorations in the fiscal stance and \\nstung gdp growth.\\nstudies also show that commodity price \\nvolatility can result in less economic growth, \\neven over longer periods of time, especially in \\nresource-rich, commodity-export-dependent \\ncountries.\\n41 this is because the tot of \\neconomies dependent on primary commodities \\ntend to deteriorate in the long run due to \\nsecular decline in primary commodities \\nrelative to prices of manufactured goods. \\ntherefore, reliance on commodity exports \\nthat lose value over time is not such a viable \\nstrategy for boosting economic growth\\n42 œ let \\nalone for eliminating external vulnerability \\nthrough diversification.\\nshocks transmitted from tot through \\nthe economy are also challenging to \\ngovernment budgets. in many low-income \\ncommodity-dependent countries, especially \\ncommodity-export-dependent countries, sharp \\ndeclines and persisting low prices in the main \\nexport commodities can drain not only export \\nrevenues but also fiscal revenues.\\nsource:\\n based on diagram from unctad and fao. 2017. \\ncommodities and development report 2017. commodity

\\nafrica, north africa and the middle east, \\nand in latin america and the caribbean. \\nfor example, public revenues of african \\ncommodity-dependent countries shrank \\nfrom an average of 26 percent of gdp during \\n2004˚2007 to 21˜percent of gdp in 2011˚2014. \\nthis partially explains why these countries™ \\naverage primary budget balances went from \\na surplus of 3.6˜percent of gdp to a deficit of \\n1.8˜percent of gdp between the two periods. \\nin response, many commodity-dependent \\ncountries increased their borrowing in order to \\nshore up their finances.\\n43such deteriorations in the fiscal stance may \\nthreaten the continuity of social programmes, \\nsafety nets, and other components of economic \\nand social development plans. food access can \\nbe negatively affected owing to governments™ \\nmore limited fiscal space to protect poor \\nhouseholds against rising domestic prices. \\ngenerally, lower foreign exchange could \\nalso affect food availability through reduced \\nfood-import capacity. contingency mechanisms \\nand funds are critical to prevent these \\nvulnerabilities from potentially harming food \\nsecurity, as further explained in section 2.4.\\ncommodity-dependent countries that face \\nsuch reductions in fiscal revenues in the \\nwake of low or declining commodity prices \\nmay need to increase borrowing to cover \\nshortfalls, thus leading to increasing public \\ndebt, which in turn can further compromise \\nlong-term growth and development, and \\nlead to higher debt-repayment schedules. \\nfor instance, many south american \\ncommodity exporters have seen sharp \\nincreases in fiscal deficits that resulted in \\nhigher public debt-to-gdp ratios.\\n44exchange rate adjustment and balance  of payments commodity prices affect the amount of foreign \\nexchange in commodity-dependent countries, \\nas they alter the value of exports and imports \\nin foreign currency. the balance of payments \\nrecords these economic transactions.\\na change in the foreign exchange available to \\nan economy will be reflected in the price of \\nforeign goods relative to the price of domestic \\ngoods, or real exchange rate. a net inflow/net \\noutflow of foreign exchange will thus result \\nin an appreciation/depreciation of the real \\nexchange rate œ other things being equal. by this \\ndefinition, both the tot and the real exchange \\nrate may be affected simultaneously.\\nwhen countries™ reserves of foreign exchange are \\ninsufficient to prevent unfavourable exchange \\nrate adjustments, they may adjust the number \\nof units of their currency that are needed to \\npurchase a unit of a given foreign currency \\nor nominal exchange rate, so as to restore \\nthe balance of payments. lower commodity \\nprices, for example, may lead to a decrease \\nof foreign exchange in the markets of the \\ncommodity-exporting countries as their export \\nrevenues fall, thus causing a real exchange \\nrate depreciation. countries that possess a \\ndomestic currency may devalue it to restore \\nthe income of their exporters in local currency. \\ndepreciation and devaluation of currencies may \\npass through the system resulting in domestic \\nprice increases.\\nin colombia and chile, for example, falling \\ninternational prices for the countries™ export \\ncommodities œ respectively crude oil and copper \\nœ led to reduced export earnings and declining \\nreserves in united states dollars (usd), triggering \\na devaluation of the local currency against usd \\n(figure 30\\n). conditional on international price \\ndevelopments for agricultural commodities, this \\ncan imply more expensive food imports, reduced \\ndomestic food availability, and rising food prices.\\nfor many commodity-dependent countries that \\nexperienced an increase in undernourishment or \\nworsening food crises, the decline in commodity \\nprices from 2011 to 2016 is associated with \\nsignificant depreciations. this was especially the \\ncase for many commodity-dependent countries \\nin africa. for example, in 2015 many currencies \\nincluding the zambian kwacha, the angolan \\nkwanza and the nigerian naira, recorded some \\nof their strongest depreciations against usd \\nin several years.\\n45 this pushed up the prices of \\nnon-commodity imports, further amplifying the \\nsharp deterioration in their terms of trade. \\n| 70 |rising domestic prices, including foodinternational commodity price fluctuations \\ncan also transmit effects into the economy \\nthrough exchange rate adjustments (\\nfigure 29\\n). \\nlarge depreciations are associated with domestic \\nprice increases and large devaluations tend to \\nbe associated with large declines in output, \\nconsumption and imports.\\n46 the pass-through \\nof international commodity price developments \\nto local domestic prices varies by commodity, \\ncountry and over time.\\n47 nonetheless, it can be \\nparticularly challenging for food security and \\nnutrition, as it can affect people™s access to food, \\ncare and feeding, as well as access to health \\nservices œ unless exceptional conditions prevail \\nto offset these effects, as seems to have been the \\ncase during the global food and financial crises \\n(box 10\\n). \\nas highlighted above, declining commodity \\nprices may result in depreciation and \\ndevaluation of currencies that may pass \\nthrough the system resulting in domestic price \\nincreases, including food prices. an alternative \\nsituation may be that food imports become \\nmore expensive owing to rising international \\ncommodity prices, with domestic food \\nprices following suit. both situations can be \\nparticularly challenging to net food importers. \\nwhile the degree and speed of pass-through \\ndepends on the country in either of these two \\nsituations, the effect of higher food prices \\nwill flow through the food value chain from \\nwholesale to retail prices. this poses a challenge \\nto food security and nutrition if the country \\nhas limited capacity to substitute food imports \\nwith domestically produced food, and it is not \\nobvious that all domestic food producers will \\nbenefit from higher food prices.\\nsouth sudan™s currency devaluations in 2015, \\n for example, immediately triggered significant \\nfood price

produce. \\nhowever, insignificant tradeable surplus by most \\nfarmers (due to low agricultural productivity), \\ncoupled with low levels of market integration \\nand linkages, may exclude a number of farming \\npopulations from benefiting from rising prices of \\nlocally produced commodities. this was the chain \\nof events in south sudan, which led to increased \\nlevels of acute food insecurity and malnutrition \\nlevels, as populations struggled to access food \\nœ particularly troubling, given that 43 percent \\nof the population of south sudan are market \\ndependent for their food needs.\\n48in these situations, households that need to \\nbuy food are immediately affected by higher \\ndomestic retail prices as the cost of food relative \\nto their incomes increases (\\nbox 12\\n). while this is \\nclearly the case in urban areas, it holds in rural \\nsettings as well. even farmers, labourers or rural \\nlandowners, who are involved in agricultural \\nactivities, can be net food buyers and negatively \\naffected by higher prices. moreover, when \\nrural incomes are strongly interlinked through \\nmultiplier effects,\\n49 food price drawbacks might \\nspill over to net food sellers and leave even \\nthem worse off.\\n50 however, once transmitted \\nto producers, higher food prices also stimulate \\nagricultural production. in the medium term, \\nthey can thus work to the benefit of the \\nrural community by increasing agricultural \\nemployment and generating opportunities to \\n earn an income up the value chain. however, \\n the example of south sudan shows that when \\nagricultural productivity and market integration \\nare low, a number of farming populations \\nmay not benefit from rising prices of locally \\nproduced food.\\nfood prices play a key role also for dietary \\ndiversity. even for smallholder farmers who cover \\nmost of their dietary energy from subsistence \\nproduction, purchased foods can critically \\ncontribute to the variety and quality of their \\ndiets.\\n51 costs tend to rise with dietary quality,\\n52 and a common strategy for coping with reduced \\npurchasing power is to shift dietary patterns \\ntowards cheaper food. as a result, nutrient intake \\nis compromised in the wake of surging prices. \\nthis coping strategy seems to have been used \\nduring the global food crisis (\\nbox 10\\n).a complex interplay between the nature \\nand magnitude of food price changes, \\nfood availability, and the nutrient content \\nof substitutes will determine the impact \\nof rising prices on nutrition. the effect \\ndoes not, however, take place uniformly. \\nhouseholds in low-income countries are prone \\nto being disproportionately affected\\n53 as are \\nurban households\\n54\\n and women and children.\\n55 whereas the influence of food price increases \\non nutrition through quality substitution is \\nimmediate, less direct channels are seen in \\nthe long term. for example, limiting health \\nexpenditure to save money for food can lead to \\nmore frequent, prolonged or more severe illness. \\nthis has negative implications for the body™s \\nuptake of essential nutrients.\\n56unemployment and loss of income and wagesworld and domestic price adjustments, such \\nas those described so far, bring about complex \\nresponses in the real economy. these responses \\nfrom the supply and aggregate-demand \\nsides will generate a number of ﬁquantityﬂ \\nadjustments, including in employment and \\nother areas, that can in turn trigger additional \\neconomy-wide effects, including in domestic \\nprices and income. \\nfor commodity-dependent countries, sluggish \\neconomic activity as a result of falling commodity \\nprices can lead to unemployment, loss of wages \\nand, consequently, loss of incomes (\\nfigure 29\\n).57 and unemployment and loss of income are \\nsignificantly related to food insecurity for the \\ngeneral population.\\n58for example, the declining economic and \\nnegative growth observed in latin america and \\nthe caribbean during 2012œ2016 was largely \\nassociated with marked declines in commodity \\nprices, mainly affecting south america.\\n59 the urban unemployment rate reached \\n8.9 percent in 2016, representing an increase of \\n1.6 percentage points from 2015. the declining \\ngdp and the rise in unemployment resulted \\nin lower wages or other forms of household \\nincomes. after several years of marked \\nreductions in poverty, the number of poor \\npeople rose from 166 million to 175 million \\nbetween 2013 and

the cost of basic food in colombiathe case of colombia illustrates the effects of an \\neconomic slowdown on the affordability of food via \\nthe described transmission channels. \\nfalling international prices for colombia™s export \\ncommodities, particularly crude oil, led to reduced \\nexport earnings and declining reserves in united \\nstates dollars, triggering a devaluation of the \\ncolombian peso (cop) against the united states \\ndollar (usd) œ see figure 30. between 2012 and 2017, gdp per capita growth \\nplummeted, along with significant current account \\nimbalances and local currency depreciation. at the \\nsame time, household income stayed put when \\nexpressed in real terms, while inflation rose steadily up \\nto 2016 (see table below).to make the impact of this economic slowdown on \\nthe affordability of food more tangible, it is helpful to \\nlook at the cost of a basic plate of food; for example, \\nthrough the ﬁcounting the beansﬂ index developed by \\nwfp, which provides a cross-country comparison of \\na stew made of beans or other pulses, paired with a \\ncarbohydrate staple that matches local preferences.1 the building block of the index is the meal-to-income \\nratio, which is the cost of a stew of beans as a share \\nof daily earnings. the effect of the economic slowdown \\non the affordability of food is obvious in the colombian \\ncase: in 2016, every colombian had to allocate on \\naverage three percent of their daily income to afford \\nsuch a basic plate of food, which is more than the \\nyearly allocation in the 2012œ2015 period. \\n| 73 |the pass-through effects on unemployment \\nand income will vary from country to country \\ndepending on what sectors are producing the \\nprimary commodities upon which the country is \\ndependent. for example, the oil and diamonds \\nsectors typically create little employment \\nand are weakly linked with the rest of the \\neconomy. on the other hand, in agriculture, \\nparticularly where export crops are grown by \\nsmallholder producers, the impacts can be more \\nwidely spread.\\nsharp and declining commodity prices may, \\nthrough reduced incomes, force households to \\nadopt coping strategies that do not necessarily \\nimprove food security and nutrition. \\nagricultural employment and smallholder  food producersthe impacts of economic slowdowns and \\ndownturns can be felt particularly hard in \\nagriculture, both because of what happens \\nwithin the sector and because of urbanœrural \\nlinkages. these impacts can be especially \\nharmful to countries lagging behind in terms of \\neconomic development and transformation.\\nthe levels of structural and rural transformation \\nof the economies (i.e. the relative levels of \\ndependence on agriculture, degree of \\nagricultural and non-farm diversification, \\ncommercialization and productivity), will \\ndetermine the extent to which economies are \\ncapable of coping with the challenges. \\nthe extent to which ruralœurban linkages \\nweaken as the economy deteriorates will \\ndetermine the impacts on agricultural and \\nrural off-farm employment and the welfare of \\nsmallholder food producers. \\nthe impacts on agriculture can be particularly \\nsignificant in low-income countries. \\nthe agricultural sector accounts for substantial \\nshares of employment and output in these \\ncountries. in 2017, agricultural employment \\naccounted for 68 percent of total employment, \\nand agricultural output accounted for about \\n26 percent of gdp in low-income countries.\\n60\\nmore generally, as employment, wages and \\nhousehold income fall, particularly in urban \\nareas, there will likely be less demand for \\nagricultural production from rural areas.\\n61 shrinking employment opportunities, including \\nthose for rural migrants, result in lower \\nremittances from urban areas and more limited \\nfarm investments in rural space. \\namong the four dimensions of food security \\nœ availability, access, utilization and stability œ \\naccess is the principal channel between economic \\nshocks and food security and nutrition, mainly \\nthrough two pillars of availability (supply \\nthrough the market or home-production) and \\naffordability (household income from farm and \\nnon-farm activities), both of which are directly \\nrelated to agricultural income and non-farm \\nemployment.\\n62\\n downturns and price volatility can significantly \\nundermine the livelihoods and income of \\nsmall-scale food producers, agricultural \\nlabourers and the rural poor, in particular those \\nwho are net food buyers, forcing them to reduce \\ntheir consumption in quantity and quality.\\n63 conversely, in some circumstances price spikes \\nmight be beneficial for farmers, as, due to \\nincreased prices, they have a higher incentive \\nto produce crops. often, food producers \\ncope with the impacts of economic shocks by \\nfocusing their production and consumption of \\nfood on staple crops. while doing so allows \\nthem to sustain dietary energy intake, it might \\nlead to a deterioration, in dietary diversity. \\nin other words, improving their productivity \\nand the availability of cash income along with \\nnutrition-sensitive behavioural change are \\ncritical for them to access higher quality and \\nmore diversified diets. broad-based income \\ngrowth, grounded on a diversified set of \\neconomic activities, including off-farm \\nactivities, can bring shifts in nutrition towards \\nbalanced dietary patterns. \\nthe impacts of economic slowdowns on food \\nsecurity and nutrition are demonstrated in \\nhaiti, nepal and the niger. amid a global \\nfinancial crisis coupled with high food prices, \\nhouseholds™ food security, as measured by \\ndietary diversity, reduced by 5 percent in nepal, \\n8 percent in the niger, and 23 percent in haiti \\ndue to increased food prices.\\n64 in the indian \\nhimalayas, economic slowdown coupled with \\nnatural resource depletion and climate change \\n  »| 74 |negatively impacted on food production and \\nemployment opportunities. this resulted in \\nincreased threats to food security due to lower \\npurchasing power.\\n65 recent research on the effects of export-led \\nagricultural growth on agricultural labour \\nshows that high-value export sectors \\ncreate formal employment opportunities \\nin rural areas and can transform the \\nlow-productivity smallholder based labour \\nmarket into a high-productivity modern \\nagro-industrial sector, thereby fostering rural \\ntransformation.\\n66 when the agro-industry and \\nthe smallholder sector are spatially close to \\neach other, direct investment and consumption \\nlinkages can lead to increased incomes and \\nnon-farm employment,\\n67 which improve \\nhousehold capacity to deal with risks œ \\nincluding those caused by economic slowdowns \\nand downturns. the ultimate effects of \\nslowdowns and downturns on households \\ndepend on whether they are global, regional \\nor national. whereas a global downturn may \\nstall the overall rural transformation process \\nby setting back the direct and spillover effects \\nof export sectors on labour markets (and hence \\nlivelihoods), a regional or national economic \\nslowdown or downturn could potentially be \\nweathered if countries are sufficiently open to \\ninternational trade.\\n68\\nhealth and social intersectoral effects \\ncuts to health and social sector spending \\nprecipitated by economic slowdowns or \\ndownturns can have negative impacts on \\nfood security and nutrition, particularly in \\nhigh commodity-dependent countries with \\npotentially lifelong and intergenerational \\nimplications for health and development \\n(figure 29\\n). \\nsocial sector expenditure œ comprising health, \\neducation and welfare/social protection \\nspending œ are core pillars for promoting \\nhealth, well-being and health equity in current \\nand future generations.\\n69 within the health \\nsector, the universal health coverage (uhc) \\napproach has demonstrated positive impacts on \\npopulation health and health equity.\\n70 similarly, \\neducation and social welfare policies have \\ndemonstrable impacts on health and well-being \\nthrough nutrition pathways such as improved \\nfeeding practices.\\n71 by ensuring universal health coverage and \\nproviding social safety nets, government \\nspending on these essential services contribute \\nto poverty reduction and improving population \\nhealth, which in turn reinforce food security \\nand nutrition.\\n72 however, economic slowdowns \\nand downturns caused by unfavourable \\ncommodity price shocks can drain fiscal revenues \\nand have implications for public budgets in \\ncommodity-dependent countries, which are not \\nall in a position to counteract these changes.\\ncuts in health spending could affect nutrition \\nthrough reduced provision of, or access to, \\nquality essential services for infant, young \\nchild and maternal nutrition mainly delivered \\nthrough the health system. reductions in \\nother areas of social spending could impact \\ndirectly or indirectly on nutrition due to a \\ndeteriorating health environment, increasing the \\nrisk of infectious diseases that can exacerbate \\nmalnutrition, or due to reduced provisions for \\nsocial protection such as school feeding, cash or \\nfood vouchers. \\ndespite the global recession and slow economic \\ngrowth experienced over

expenditure and reductions in \\nother essential social expenditure have health \\nrepercussions through impaired food security \\nand nutrition and other impact pathways, in \\nparticular for poorer populations. \\nreduced health spending affects the quality \\nand effectiveness of health services, for example \\nthrough less frequent service provision, \\nshortages of medication and equipment or \\nsupplies, and reduced staff numbers and lower \\nstaff morale. this can impact nutrition directly \\nthrough reduced micronutrient supplementation, \\nbreastfeeding support and other essential \\nnutrition actions for mothers, infants and young \\nchildren; and indirectly through reduced services \\naffecting family planning, antenatal care and \\ninterventions to prevent or control infectious \\ndiseases or diet-related non-communicable \\ndiseases.\\n76 during economic crises, populations \\ntend to switch from private to public services, \\nwhen funding and services are

user fees can also \\ndrive people into poverty,\\n79\\n limiting household \\nbudgets for needed food. \\nsimilarly, reduced government budgets \\ncan affect other important social \\nexpenditures, including for education \\n(table 10\\n). education expenditures for high \\ncommodity-dependent countries decreased as \\na percentage of total government expenditure \\nbetween 2008 and 2015 œ by 0.3 percentage \\npoints and 2.0 percentage points in low-income \\nand lower-middle-income countries, respectively. \\nreduced education expenditures is a problem in \\nits own right, but it also means less investment \\nin school infrastructure relevant to health, \\nsuch as for safe water and sanitation, which \\naffects the risk of infectious disease,\\n80 such as \\ndiarrhoea, and can exacerbate or be exacerbated \\nby undernutrition.\\n81 governments also struggle \\nto maintain social protection measures during \\neconomic slowdowns and downturns, including \\ncash and food transfers, food vouchers and \\nschool meals, which are particularly important \\nfor food security and nutrition.\\n82 in addition, the ways in which families have \\nto cope with economic crises can impact infant \\nand young childcare, including breastfeeding \\npractices. economic pressures on mothers to \\nwork soon after childbirth can reduce their \\nability to exclusively breastfeed for six months, \\nwhile pressures on government budgets and \\nprivate sector employers may undermine \\nmaternity provision. resource constraints can \\nalso compromise caregivers™ ability to provide \\noptimal care to infants and young children due \\nto increased workload, time pressures or poor \\nhealth.\\n83 how households cope and when they fail households facing a reduction in purchasing \\npower as a result of economic events have to look \\nfor ways to cope with these shocks to maintain \\nfood security and consumption to the extent \\npossible (\\nfigure 29\\n). \\ndue to their economy-wide nature, economic \\nslowdowns and downturns pose macroeconomic \\naggregate shocks affecting multiple households, \\nwhich are different from idiosyncratic shocks \\nthat affect only a single household, such as the \\nillness of a household member. this means that \\nmany coping strategies that are used during \\nidiosyncratic shocks are ineffective in the face of \\nsuch aggregate shocks.\\n84˜during economic slowdowns and downturns, \\nwages can decline and jobs might be more \\ndifficult to find, and consequently households \\nlosing their employment might have to take up \\nlower paying jobs, often in the informal sector. \\nin such circumstances, household members \\nnormally not involved in salaried activities œ \\n for example, women and younger members still \\nin

also, public \\nspending on safety nets might decrease during \\neconomic slowdowns, thereby leaving behind \\nmany households in need.\\n85 one coping strategy which has been shown in \\nsome countries to work well in times of economic \\nslowdowns and downturns is return migration to \\nthe village of origin. as food prices rise, farmers \\nbenefit from the labour supply of returned \\nmigrants and from increased agricultural \\nproduction, enabling them to better cope with \\njob losses and reduced remittances of affected \\nmigrants.\\n86 alternatively, workers might seek job \\nopportunities in other countries, thus increasing \\nthe inflow of remittances. \\nwhile the availability of coping strategies is \\nrestricted for households in general, coping \\nis particularly challenging for vulnerable \\nhouseholds, as they are endowed with fewer \\nassets to deplete and often have weaker social \\nnetworks for support. they are more often forced \\nto take up coping strategies that help in the \\nshort term while jeopardizing future earning \\npossibilities and the human capital of the \\nhousehold, such as taking children out of school, \\npossibly leading them into an intergenerational \\npoverty trap.\\n87 for example, they may have to sell assets \\nthat are essential for their livelihood, such \\nas the last female animals in their livestock, \\nproductive tools or seeds, or they may be forced \\nto incur too much debt. the need to change \\nconsumption patterns can lead to reduced \\nspending on education and health, or shifts in \\nnutrition away from nutrient-rich foods, such \\nas vegetables or meat, towards more starchy \\nfoods. while securing access to sufficient dietary \\nenergy in the short term, this behaviour will have \\nnegative long-term effects on people™s nutrition \\nand health and human capital\\n88 as seen during \\nthe global food crisis (\\nbox 10\\n). \\n 2.3\\n  nexus between \\neconomic growth, \\npoverty, and food \\nsecurity and \\nnutrition: the role \\n of inequality key messages \\n economic events will ultimately affect food security \\nand nutrition, depending on extreme poverty levels \\nand the extent to which the poor face exclusion due to \\ndifferent inequalities. however, outcomes may vary \\nfrom country to country.\\n while extreme poverty is one of the underlying \\ncauses of food insecurity and malnutrition, \\nfood-insecure and malnourished people are not \\nalways members of the poorest households. most of \\nthe hungry and undernourished populations today live \\nin middle-income countries. \\n inequalities are one of the myriad reasons why \\nextreme poverty reduction does not necessarily \\ntranslate into improved food security and nutrition. \\nsocially excluded and marginalized groups are at \\nincreased risk of food insecurity, unhealthy diets, \\nmalnutrition in all its forms and poor health outcomes.\\n income inequality is rising in several low- and \\nmiddle-income countries. inequalities are also seen in \\naccessing basic services and assets, between and \\nwithin households. all of this is making it more difficult \\nfor poor and marginalized groups to benefit from \\neconomic growth.\\n inequalities not only prevent the most \\nfood-insecure and malnourished people from being \\nhelped by economic growth; they also make these \\npeople more vulnerable in the face of economic \\nslowdowns and downturns.\\n| 79 |poverty and socio-economic inequalities  also mattereconomic slowdowns and downturns generate a \\nnumber of direct and indirect impacts that flow \\nthrough different transmission channels and \\nchallenge food security and nutrition. many of \\nthese impacts can be generalized. they are \\ntransmitted through prices and economy-wide \\nresponses that would behave in a similar manner \\nin most low- and middle-income countries. \\ndeclining commodity prices trigger unambiguous \\neconomic effects in high commodity-dependent \\ncountries with implications for food security \\nand nutrition. \\nthe final impact on food security and nutrition, \\nhowever, depends on how many poor people \\nlive in the country and the extent to which they \\nface exclusion due to inequalities. on the one \\nhand, economic slowdowns and downturns \\ntend to be correlated with increases in poverty \\nand inequality. on the other hand, poverty, \\ninequalities and marginalization are some of the \\nunderlying causes of hunger and malnutrition in \\nall its forms. but the relationships between these \\nfactors are not so simple, for a number of reasons.\\nfirst, it is not always true that robust economic \\ngrowth helps to reduce poverty and improve \\nfood security and nutrition.\\n89 economic growth, \\nalthough necessary, may not be sufficient \\nto ensure poverty reduction, food security \\nand nutrition. many countries have achieved \\neconomic growth, but show poor records in terms \\nof poverty alleviation\\n90 and improvements in food \\nsecurity and nutrition. \\nsecond, poverty, food security and nutrition do \\nnot always move in unison. countries can achieve \\nrobust economic growth and poverty reduction, \\nbut this does not always translate into improved \\nfood security and nutrition. the disconnect \\nhas become even more apparent recently, as \\nmany countries have made significant progress \\nin reducing poverty but not in improving food \\nsecurity and nutrition indicators.\\n91 third, when poverty reduction does result in \\nincreased food security, this does not necessarily \\nmean nutritional status will be improved as \\nwell. poverty and food insecurity is only weakly \\nlinked with malnutrition, and there may be \\nother factors at play. for example, stunting \\nin children is not only related to the quality \\nof diet, but also to hygiene, health care and \\nmaternal nutrition during pregnancy, among \\nothers. high-quality foods might not be evenly \\ndistributed among household members or \\nhouseholds may not have access to adequate \\nsanitation, safe drinking water and health care.\\nthe next section explores the nexus between \\neconomic growth, poverty,\\n92 and food security \\nand nutrition. in doing so, it looks at the central \\nrole of inequality in shaping the outcomes \\nof food security and nutrition in this nexus. \\nunderstanding the relationships is critical \\nif countries are to design targeted policies \\nand programmes to address food insecurity \\nand malnutrition. \\na key feature of the 2030 agenda for \\nsustainable development is the recognition \\nof the interconnectedness between the sdgs. \\nignoring the nexus between economic growth, \\npoverty, food security and nutrition, and the role \\ninequalities play within this nexus, could push \\npolicies and programmes designed to end hunger \\nand malnutrition to miss their mark and fail. \\nrooting out hunger and malnutrition in all its \\nforms will require an integrated understanding to \\ninform solutions that are not exclusively relevant \\nfor sdg 2 (ending hunger and malnutrition in \\nall its forms) but also other sdgs, particularly \\nœ albeit not exclusively œ sdg 1 (ending poverty \\nin all of its manifestations),\\n93 sdg 8 (promoting \\ninclusive and sustainable economic growth), and \\nsdg 10 (reducing inequalities). \\ndisentangling the nexus to better understand the nexus between \\neconomic growth, poverty, and food security \\nand nutrition, it is important to recognize \\nthat these are multidimensional concepts \\nthat are multidirectional in their relationship \\nto one another (e.g. hunger is a result of \\npoverty, but hunger itself is a cause of \\npoverty). evidence also indicates that stunting \\ncontributes to intergenerational transmission of \\npoverty and deprivation, which often explains \\nintergenerational effects on linear growth of \\nchildren.\\n94| 80 |poverty, food security and nutrition are \\ninterrelated, but they are also distinct from one \\nanother.\\n95 they often move together, but they \\nare also different and have unique determinants, \\nso they are not always correlated. for example, \\npoverty can be on the decline, while progress \\nin reducing food insecurity and malnutrition \\nstagnates or even reverses course. \\nunpacking the nexus between economic growth, \\npoverty, food security and nutrition is complex. \\ntherefore, this section will look at three separate \\nlinkages and relationships. first, evidence on \\nthe links between economic growth and poverty \\nreduction will be reviewed, followed by the links \\nbetween economic growth and food security and \\nnutrition, and then the links between poverty \\nand food security and nutrition.\\neconomic growth and poverty reduction\\nsustained economic growth is one of the \\nmost critical factors in alleviating poverty. \\nnumerous cross-country studies and statistical \\nevidence confirm that the main determinant \\nof poverty reduction is the pace of economic \\ngrowth.\\n96 there is clear evidence for the positive \\nassociation, but the magnitude or strength of the \\neffect varies across countries. \\nfor example, one study found that growth in \\naverage incomes as measured by gdp per capita \\nexplained approximately half of the variations \\nin short-run changes of poverty level.\\n97\\n another \\nstudy on 14 countries between 1990 and 2003 \\nfound that a one percent increase in gdp per \\ncapita reduced poverty by 1.7 percent.\\n98 for some \\ncountries such as viet nam, the reduction was \\nspectacular œ a halving of the poverty rate from \\n58 percent to 29 percent, or almost 8 percent \\na year. poverty rates have declined between \\n3 percent and 6 percent per year in el salvador, \\nghana, india, tunisia and uganda.\\nworld price shocks and macroeconomic \\nadjustments affecting economic growth directly, \\nsuch as those described in section 2.2, can \\npotentially affect poverty. for countries with \\nhigh primary commodity dependence, the \\ndegree of macroeconomic stability, in particular \\navoiding inflationary shocks, is a critical factor. \\nthe sectoral composition of economic growth \\ncan also explain in some cases why given rates \\nof economic growth can lead to different rates of \\npoverty reduction. \\nthe rate at which poverty shrinks as growth \\naccelerates differs from country to country, \\ngiven the initial level of income inequality in \\nthe country and changes in income inequality \\nover time.\\n99 for example, senegal and burkina \\nfaso had similar levels of economic growth œ \\n2.2 percent per capita per year œ over a similar \\ntimeframe.\\n100\\n but poverty declined by 2.5 percent \\nannually in senegal and by just 1.8 percent \\nin burkina faso. senegal made more progress \\nbecause it had less inequality as a result of \\npro-poor growth policies introduced in the 1990s. \\nanother study found that for countries where \\nincome inequality was very high, a 1 percent \\nincrease in average household income levels had \\na much lower impact on poverty (0.6 percent \\nreduction) than it did in countries where \\ninequality was low (4.3 percent).\\n101\\n by comparison, between 2001 and 2017, mali \\nexperienced limited economic growth with an \\naverage gdp per capita growth of 1.9 percent.\\n102\\n however, the country still made significant \\nstrides in reducing poverty and improving social \\nindicators. an important part of mali™s success \\nin poverty reduction can be attributed to its \\nremarkable performance in reducing inequality. \\nthe country™s gini coefficient has fallen from \\n39.9 in 2001 to 33 in 2011, making mali™s growth \\nperformance an inclusive one. more importantly, \\ncalculations by the world bank\\n103\\n show that \\n82 percent of the poverty reduction performance \\nof the country between 2001 and 2010 can be \\nattributed to better distribution of consumption \\namong households œ the remaining 18˜percent \\nseems to be mostly explained by the average \\nincrease in consumption. of course, these gains \\nhave been threatened by the conflict in the \\ncountry that erupted in 2012. \\nin addition to the initial level of income inequality, \\nthe pattern of economic growth and different \\ninitial conditions in human development reflecting \\na number of other inequalities beyond income also \\nfactor in to determine whether economic growth \\ntranslates into poverty reduction (\\nbox 13\\n).income inequality can also reduce the impact of \\nfuture economic growth on poverty reduction.\\n104\\n   »| 81 |box 13explaining poverty and food security and

\\ngrowth in recent years. between 1990 and 2017, the \\ntwo countries had an average gdp per capita growth \\nrate of 8.6 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively.\\n1 however, the effects of growth within each country \\nhave been different.the figure below shows that in both countries the \\nincrease in gdp per capita has been accompanied \\nby poverty reduction. china™s poverty rate declined \\nfrom 88 percent in 1981 to 0.7 percent in 2015. \\nin comparison, india™s poverty reduction seems \\nrelatively more modest1 ˜ moving from 48.9 percent in \\n1987 to 21.2 percent in 2011, or to 13.4˚percent in \\n2015 if another world bank source is used.\\n2 for the \\nperiod 1999œ2005, the income elasticity of poverty \\nin china was estimated at 1.51. this means that a \\n1 percent increase in gdp per capita was associated \\nwith poverty reduction rates of 1.51 percent. during the \\nsame period, india had an income elasticity of poverty \\nof only 0.4.regarding hunger and malnutrition, the pou \\ndecreased from 15.9 percent in 2002œ2004 to \\n8.8 percent in 2015œ2017 in china, compared \\nwith a decrease from 22.2 percent in 2002œ2004 \\nto 14.8 percent in 2015œ2017 in india. stunting in \\nchildren under five years of age fell from 17.8 percent \\nin 2000 to 8.1 percent in 2013 in china. in india, it \\nfell from 54.2˚percent to 38.4 percent between 2000 \\nand 2015, which is still a high prevalence, compared \\nwith a global average of 23.2 percent in 2015.1, 3the unique growth patterns and inequality levels \\nin each country may help explain the differences \\nobserved in the countries in terms of poverty and food \\nsecurity and nutrition trends: \\n| 82 |box 13(continued)a. the pattern of economic growth in china, \\nespecially in the 1980s, shows that the primary \\nsector, where most of the poor derive their \\nlivelihoods, was one of the most dynamic \\nsectors behind gdp growth. on the other hand, \\nin india the rate of growth has been higher \\nin the industrial and services sectors than in \\nagriculture.\\n4b. the responsiveness of poverty reduction to \\ngrowth is generally higher when initial inequality \\nis lower. this seems to have been the case for \\nincome inequality in china, where in 1983 the \\ngini coefficient was 28.3. in india, the gini \\ncoefficient that year was 31.5.\\n5 at the same time, \\nland was much more equally allocated in china \\nthan in india during the 1980s.\\n6 furthermore, \\nthe gini coefficient for urban and rural areas in \\n1983œ84 was 24.7 and 18.5, respectively, in \\nchina, compared with 30.0 in urban areas and \\n33.3 in rural areas in india.\\n7 c. finally, different initial conditions in human \\ndevelopment also played an important role. \\nhealth and education standards were much \\nbetter in china in the 1980s than they were in \\nindia.\\n8 in 1980, china had 2.2 hospital beds \\nper 1 000 people compared with 0.8 in india. \\nthis number increased to 3.8 in 2011, while it \\ndecreased to 0.7 in india. differences in literacy \\nrates were also important. only in 2011 india \\nwas able to reach the levels of literacy that \\nchina had in 1982, amounting to more than \\n65 percent.\\n9 1 world bank. 2019. world development indicators. in: \\nworld bank databank\\n [online]. washington, dc.

gini coefficient from \\n0.55 to 0.45, would cause poverty to drop by \\nmore than 15 percentage points in ten years. \\nhowever, it would take 30 years to achieve the \\nsame reduction in poverty if inequality remained \\nunchanged.\\n105\\n economic growth, food security and nutrition the relationship between economic growth \\nand food security and nutrition has important \\npolicy implications. these involve pro-poor \\ngrowth strategies to reduce hunger and child \\nmalnutrition, as well as the need for direct \\nfood security and nutritional investments. \\nby extension, the implications also affect how \\nlimited financial resources are competitively \\nallocated between different types of investments.\\nhow does economic growth contribute  to nutrition? the relationship between increased national \\nincome (gdp per capita) and nutrition works \\nthrough two complementary channels. \\nwhen economic growth stimulates average \\nincomes, populations may spend a larger part \\nof their incomes on healthy, nutrition-relevant \\ngoods and services. increased gdp may also \\nboost state provision of nutrition-relevant \\nservices as well as social and health \\ninfrastructure œ if governments use newly \\ngenerated tax revenues to invest in them. \\nthe role of economic growth in reducing \\nchild undernutrition remains a highly \\ndebated issue. for example, there is extensive \\nempirical evidence that economic growth and \\nchild stunting are negatively correlated (i.e. \\nthe higher the economic growth, the lower \\nthe child stunting). however, evidence on the \\nmagnitude of this relationship varies across \\nstudies.\\n106\\n one study finds a prominent role for \\neconomic growth, in which a 10 percent increase \\nin gdp per capita would lead to a 6 percent \\nreduction in child stunting prevalence.\\n107\\n  while this is in line with the findings of several \\nstudies,\\n108\\n others find that child stunting \\nwould be decreased even more, for example \\nby 7.3 percent.\\n109\\n in contrast, still others find \\nthe relationship to be much weaker or even \\nnonexistent.\\n110\\n the relationships between economic growth \\nand child stunting can also differ by region. \\nfor example, cross-country time series data \\nsuggest that the relationship is weaker in \\nsub-saharan africa than in other regions.\\n111 for africa as a whole, other variables such as \\nmaternal education, socio-economic status and \\npoor maternal nutrition are more important in \\nexplaining the slow progress in reducing child \\nundernutrition.\\n112\\nnot only can economic growth affect child \\nstunting, but the reverse may occur.\\n113\\n a new \\nstudy finds that a 10 percent increase in gdp \\nper capita would reduce stunting prevalence \\nby 2.7 percent. however, the reverse causality \\nimpacts of stunting on current growth estimate \\nthat a one percentage point increase in stunting \\nprevalence would result in a 0.4 percent \\ndecrease in current gdp per capita. the study™s \\nback-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that \\nstunting costs on average about 13.5 percent of \\ngdp per capita in developing countries.\\n114\\n  if these recent findings on the negative reverse \\ncausality are correct, it implies that the results of \\nearlier studies could be biased downwards and \\noverstate the actual impact of economic growth \\ntowards child stunting reductions. \\ndespite the debate on the magnitude of \\neffects, it is clear that while economic growth \\ncontributes to improvements in child nutrition, \\nit does so only modestly and is not sufficient in \\nmany settings to accelerate reductions in child \\nundernutrition. what matters most is addressing \\nother causes of undernutrition, including \\naccess to nutritious foods for a healthy diet, \\nimprovement in women™s status and education, \\nfeeding and care practices and quality health \\nservices. this requires implementation of \\nnutrition-specific policies and interventions with \\na focus on vulnerable populations, regardless of \\nwhether there is economic growth.\\n115\\nas for obesity and overweight, their relationship \\nwith economic growth is less clear-cut due to \\nthe paucity of research. however, evidence does \\nsuggest that the relationship varies depending on \\nthe income setting of the country. for example, \\na study using data from 175 countries found a \\npositive relationship between body weight and \\ngdp per capita growth. seventy-two countries \\n  »| 84 |where gdp was below usd˜3˜000 showed \\na significantly positive linear relationship \\nbetween the body mass index (bmi) and gdp, \\nwhereas 102 countries where gdp was above \\nusd˜3˜000 showed no significant relationship \\nbetween the two.\\n116\\n clearly, income growth \\nalone does not necessarily guarantee healthier \\ndiets and improved nutritional status; other \\npolicies, for example those that create healthy \\nfood environments and facilitate and promote \\nphysically active lives, among others, are \\nalso needed. \\nhow does economic growth contribute to  food security? there is even less empirical evidence on \\nthe links between economic growth and \\nfood security, partially due to the lack of \\ncommon food-insecurity measures and data. \\nempirical analysis is increasingly common, \\nhowever, given the development of the food \\ninsecurity experience scale (fies) by fao \\nand with the newly available fies panel \\ndata (for more details about fies see part 1). \\nrecent studies provide consistent results and \\nan important first indication of the relationship, \\nalthough evidence is not conclusive and more \\nresearch is required.\\nthe results generally confirm that with increases \\nin economic growth, there are concurrent declines \\nin severe food insecurity. however, similar to \\nchild stunting, the magnitude of this relationship \\nvaries across countries. in this case, it varies by \\nincome level and the degree of income inequality \\nof the country.\\n117\\n one recent study for latin america and the \\ncaribbean finds that a 10 percent increase in a \\ncountry™s gdp per capita lowered the likelihood \\nof moderate and severe food insecurity by \\n11.5 percentage points and severe food insecurity \\nby 9.7 percentage points.\\n118\\n another study of \\n134 countries also finds the same negative \\nrelationship, but with much smaller effects and \\nwith statistically significant results only for \\n low- and high-income countries.\\n119\\nto complement these two studies, a new fao \\nanalysis was conducted for this report, using \\nnewly available cross-country fies panel data for \\n75 low- and middle-income countries. the results \\nreconfirmed a negative relationship between \\ngdp per capita and severe food insecurity.\\n120\\n an fao analysis found that the relationship \\nbetween gdp per capita and undernourishment \\n(as measured by the prevalence) was also \\nnegative. however, it was highly nonlinear, \\nmeaning that the relationship became \\nprogressively weaker at higher levels of \\ndevelopment. the most recent data show that the \\nstrength of the relationship decreases sharply up \\nto usd˜2˜000 per capita in constant prices, which \\nis within the lower-middle-income category \\n(countries with income of usd˜996œ3˜895 per \\ncapita). in other words, economic growth is more \\neffective in reducing the pou in low-income \\ncountries; as the level of a country™s gdp per \\ncapita rises, the effect weakens. most of the \\nworld™s hungry, however, live in middle-income \\ncountries (see next section). so the potential \\ncontributions of economic growth to ending \\nhunger are weaker than expected. \\npoverty reduction and food security and nutrition\\nit is commonly understood that poverty goes \\nhand in hand with hunger and malnutrition. \\npoverty is indeed one of the underlying causes of \\nfood insecurity and malnutrition. however, they \\ndo not always move in unison, and in some cases \\nthey diverge from what is expected. investigating \\nwhy this is the case is critical for eradicating food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition.\\nthe relationship between poverty, food \\nsecurity and nutrition is also bidirectional, \\nmeaning that food security and nutrition are \\nboth determinants and dimensions of poverty. \\nfood insecurity, poor health and malnutrition \\nare often reasons why households end up \\nin poverty or sink further into it, if they are \\nalready poor.\\n121\\none reason is that poverty, food insecurity \\nand malnutrition are distinct and multifaceted \\nphenomena.\\n122\\n not all people who are food \\ninsecure and malnourished necessarily live \\nin the poorest households. this is especially \\nso when the problems of food insecurity and \\nmalnutrition are greater. additionally, poverty \\nreduction may not necessarily translate into \\nbetter food security and nutrition due to \\nexisting inequalities.\\n| 85 |by definition, extreme poverty is the lack \\nof sufficient income to meet basic dietary \\nneeds. it affects the ability of individuals and \\nhouseholds to access healthy, nutritious foods \\nthat constitute a healthy diet through purchase \\nor production, and is linked to minimal or \\ninadequate access to essential health services. \\nthe world bank defines extreme poverty as \\nliving on less than usd 1.90 per day, which \\ngenerally reflects the cost of enough dietary \\nenergy and other essentials to meet basic needs. \\nthis is a very low poverty threshold, as it is \\nestimated based on the average of the national \\npoverty lines of 15 very poor countries, adjusted \\nfor inflation using 2011 prices and taking into \\naccount differences in prices across countries \\n(i.e. purchasing power parity œ ppp). the main \\npurpose is to help obtain a measure of extreme \\npoverty comparable across countries. \\nhigher levels of extreme poverty as defined by \\nthe world bank are correlated with higher rates \\nof undernourishment as measured by the pou, \\nand higher rates of child stunting at the country \\nlevel, with the latter relationship being nonlinear \\n(figure 31\\n). the correlation coefficient between \\nextreme poverty and undernourishment is 0.68, \\nand it is 0.62 between extreme poverty and child \\nstunting. this indicates a moderate-to-strong \\ncorrelation between poverty and these two \\nmeasures of food security and nutrition. \\npoverty explains around half of the observed \\nvariation in undernourishment and child stunting \\n(i.e. r-squared of 0.50 and 0.57 for pou and child \\nstunting, respectively). however, there are also \\na number of countries where undernourishment \\nand child stunting are higher than predicted \\nby extreme poverty (countries above the line in \\nfigure 31\\n) and countries that have lower levels than \\npredicted by extreme poverty (countries below \\nthe line in \\nfigure 31\\n).beyond the absolute levels of income or poverty, \\nvariability of income is critical and is often one \\nof the main causes of food insecurity.\\n123\\n income \\nvariability, even within the same year, can have a \\nsignificant impact on food access. it is caused by \\na convergence of factors, such as weather-related \\nshocks, that limit households™ ability to smooth \\nconsumption over time, rendering access \\nto food, health and nutrition vulnerable to \\neconomic shocks.\\nin addition to income variability, access to food \\nis also conditioned by people™s awareness and \\nknowledge of food quality, as well as other \\nfactors that can cause significant differences \\nwhen it comes to malnutrition among members \\nof households at similar levels of poverty. \\nother factors include diverse consumption and \\nintra-household distribution patterns, dietary \\nhabits, climate conditions and cultural factors.\\n124\\n there is also an array of public policies that can \\nsignificantly affect non-income-based access to \\nfood and utilization of food, and access to basic \\nhealth and social services critical to nutrition, as \\noutlined in the icn2 framework for action.\\n125\\n at the household level, there is clear evidence \\nthat low levels of household income and \\nhousehold wealth are associated with different \\nforms of malnutrition. for example, the poorest \\nchildren are 2.26 times more likely to be \\nstunted than the richest children. however, the \\nextent of the income inequality in stunting \\nvaries considerably. for example, there is an \\nelevenfold difference between the richest and \\nthe poorest children in peru, and more than \\nfivefold differences in bolivia (plurinational \\nstate of), gabon, honduras and jordan.\\n126\\n other multi-country studies confirm that \\nstunting prevalence is higher in households \\nwith lower wealth and income.\\n127\\n country data \\nfrom cambodia,\\n128\\n colombia,\\n129\\n india,\\n130\\n and \\npakistan\\n131\\n find a similar pattern.\\nwhile the analysis of selected country microdata \\nalso confirms that higher levels of child \\nstunting are found in the poorest households, \\nit also shows that not all stunted children live \\nin the poorest households. in some countries \\nthis number can be quite large (\\nfigure 32\\n). \\nfor example, a recent study of 30 countries in \\nsub-saharan africa found that around 75 percent \\nof underweight women and children were not \\nin the poorest 20 percent of households, and \\naround half were not in the poorest 40 percent of \\nhouseholds.\\n132\\n the study also found that a larger \\nshare of undernourished people are members \\nof non-poor families in countries with a higher \\noverall incidence of undernutrition. \\n

linked, \\nbut food security is only one underlying cause \\nof nutrition besides adequate care for children \\nand women, and sufficient health services and \\na healthy environment. therefore, the linkages \\nbetween food insecurity and malnutrition may \\nbe weak. \\nfor example, high-quality foods might not \\nbe evenly distributed among household \\nmembers, reflecting intra-household inequality. \\nhouseholds may not have access to basic \\nservices, such as adequate sanitation, safe \\ndrinking water and health care, which are \\ncritical underlying determinants of food security \\nand nutrition. adequate access to food and basic \\nservices often play a more important role in \\nfighting hunger and delayed child growth and \\nother forms of malnutrition, despite economic \\ngrowth and income.\\n138\\nevidence for the possible disconnect between \\npoverty reduction and eradication of food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition has important policy \\nimplications, given that anti-poverty policies in \\ndeveloping countries often assume that targeting \\npoor households will be reasonably effective in \\nreaching those who are malnourished. from a \\npolicy perspective, the evidence suggests that \\ntargeting relatively poor households will tend to \\nwork less well than reaching vulnerable women \\nand children in countries where the overall \\nproblem of

indicators, in the case of overweight \\nand obesity, the relationship with poverty is not \\nso clear and generally tends to vary depending on \\nthe general income level of the country. \\na systematic review of obesity shows that the \\nassociation between socio-economic status \\nand obesity appears to be positive for both \\nmen and women in low-income countries. \\nthose who are more affluent or with higher \\neducational attainment tend to be more likely to \\nbe obese.\\n140\\n on the other hand, more extensive \\nevidence shows that in middle- and high-income \\ncountries, overweight and obesity are linked to \\nlower socio-economic settings among women, \\nwith no association observed among men.\\n141\\n in middle-income countries, the association \\nbecomes largely mixed for men and mainly \\nnegative for women. obesity in children appears \\nto be predominantly a problem of the rich in low- \\nand middle-income countries.\\n142\\nthe burden of obesity tends to shift towards \\npoorer populations as countries move through \\nthe nutrition transition.\\n143\\n this shift towards \\noverweight and obesity in people with lower \\nsocio-economic status seems to be happening \\nfaster in low-income countries than it did in \\nhigh-income countries.\\n144\\n however, there are still inconsistencies in the \\ndata on this issue. a meta-analysis of the data \\nfrom 62 scientific papers published between \\n1990 and 2015 concludes that the studies \\nthat investigated the association between \\nsocio-economic status and obesity in children \\npoint to ambiguous results.\\n145\\n this meta-analysis \\nfinds that children with lower socio-economic \\nstatus had higher risks of overweight and obesity, \\nbut the risks did not seem to increase with the \\nincome level of countries. moreover, the inverse \\nrelationship œ a higher risk of overweight and \\nobesity associated with higher socio-economic \\nstatus œ was found in high-income countries and \\nin more economically developed areas.  \\noverweight and obesity increase the risk of \\nnon-communicable diseases, which, in turn, \\ncan be linked to loss of income or earning \\npotential due to illness as well as increased \\nhealthcare costs. \\nthe role of inequalities and marginalization in shaping food-security and nutrition outcomes it is clear from the evidence presented up until \\nnow that economic growth alone is not sufficient \\nto reduce extreme poverty or improve food \\nsecurity and nutrition. in most cases, the rate \\nat which extreme poverty shrinks as growth \\naccelerates differs from country to country, \\ngiven the initial level of income inequality in \\nthe country and changes in income inequality \\nover time. \\ninequality, not only in the distribution of \\nincome, but also in access to nutrition-relevant \\nservices and social and health infrastructure is \\ncritical in understanding why economic growth \\nalone will not significantly reduce extreme \\npoverty or food insecurity and malnutrition. \\nincome inequality itself can result not only in \\nundernutrition, but also overweight and obesity, \\nas the higher costs of nutritious foods induces \\nthe poor to resort to cheap, energy-dense and \\nnutrient-poor foods. \\nfurthermore, inequalities within households \\nhelp explain why even when economic growth \\ntranslates into extreme poverty reduction, it \\nmay not necessarily reduce food insecurity \\nand malnutrition. thus, reducing inequality \\nplays an important role in reducing both \\nundernourishment and malnutrition.\\nthis is true at all times, not only for periods \\nof economic boom. inequalities are structural \\ncharacteristics of countries that prevent the \\nmost food-insecure and malnourished people \\nfrom being helped by economic growth, \\nbut they also expose and make them more \\nvulnerable during periods of economic \\nturmoil. in fact, evidence indicates that in \\ncountries that have greater levels of inequality, \\neconomic slowdowns and downturns have a \\ndisproportionately negative effect on food and \\nnutrition security.\\n146\\n| 90 |this section looks more closely at the different \\nforms of inequality and the evidence on how \\nthese inequalities work to shape outcomes \\nof food security and nutrition. five forms of \\ninequality are explored: income inequality, \\ninequalities between rural and urban \\npopulations, inequalities in asset distribution, \\nmarginalization and social exclusion, and \\nintra-household inequality.\\nit is important to acknowledge that any analysis \\non inequality is challenging, as there is a lack of \\ndata disaggregated by wealth quintile, gender, \\nage, geography and disability, which poses a \\nsignificant barrier to addressing inequality and \\ntackling undernourishment and malnutrition \\nin marginalized groups.\\n147\\n data on prevalence \\nand national averages of undernourishment \\nand malnutrition are not sufficient to fully \\nunderstand and address these issues. \\ninequality in income distributionincome inequality is a defining issue of our \\ntime. it is also a cause of entrenched uncertainty \\nand vulnerability.\\n148\\n a country experiences \\nincome inequality when not every member of \\nits population gets exactly the same share of the \\nincome the economy is generating. although the \\nworld has made remarkable progress in reducing \\nextreme poverty, income inequality remains \\nhigh. this means that most of the reduction in \\npoverty has been achieved through increased \\neconomic growth, not through reductions in \\nincome inequality.\\n149\\n income inequality has remained constant and \\nhigh over the last 15 years (\\nfigure 34\\n).150\\n as a region, \\nlatin america and the caribbean shows the \\nmost progress in reducing income inequality, but \\nstill has the highest levels of inequality globally \\n(figure 34\\n). nonetheless, this overall progress in \\nincome distribution does not seem to be shown in \\nthe distribution of workers™ remuneration.\\n151\\n measured by the shared prosperity premium\\n152\\n œ the difference between the annual income \\nor consumption growth rate of the bottom \\n40 percent and the annual growth rate of the \\nmean in the economy œ inequality is rising \\nin nearly half of the countries in the world, \\nincluding many low- and middle-income \\ncountries (\\nfigure 35\\n). \\nhowever, when focusing only on low- and \\nmiddle-income countries, the income \\ndistribution trend is mixed. in \\nfigure 36\\n, countries \\nabove the line have seen an increase in \\nincome inequality from 2000 to 2015, whereas \\nthose below the line have seen a reduction. \\nnotably, several countries in africa and asia \\nhave seen large increases in income inequality \\nover the last 15 years. of the 78 countries shown \\nin the figure, 58 are high commodity-dependent \\ncountries. in 12 of these countries, income \\ninequality remained unchanged, while \\nfor 26 of these, inequality increased. \\nmore importantly, 20 out of these 26 are high \\ncommodity-dependent countries. \\nincome inequality is shaped by the type of \\neconomic growth and the distribution of \\nearnings from factor markets, particularly \\nthose of labour and capital. countries in latin \\namerica, where inequality remains high, \\nimplemented many reforms beginning in the \\n1990s to open up their economies and promote \\nexport-led growth. costa rica is an example \\nin the region of a country where the export \\nsector was diversified. interestingly, income \\ninequality rose in costa rica as a result of the \\nskill intensity of the new export sectors, which \\ncontributed to widening wage gaps.\\n153\\n income inequality also shapes the impact of \\neconomic growth. for instance, if economic \\ngrowth is associated with rising income \\ninequality (kuznets curve),\\n154\\n the poorest may \\nnot benefit from increased national income.\\n155\\n the links between economic growth with \\nincreased average incomes and increased food \\nand nutrition security can be weaker than \\nexpected, especially if there are high levels of \\nincome inequality. in the context of economic \\ngrowth with high inequality, inequalities must \\nbe addressed to ensure a way out of hunger \\nand malnutrition (\\nbox 14\\n).income inequality shapes the impact of economic \\ndeceleration or contraction on food security \\nand nutrition. in countries where inequality is \\ngreater, economic slowdowns and downturns \\nhave a disproportionate effect on low-income \\npopulations in terms of food and nutrition \\nsecurity, since they use large portions of their \\nincome to buy food. \\n| 91 |notes: \\neurope refers to low-income and middle-income countries in eastern europe. in particular, european countries include albania, belarus,

practices, research findings \\nindicate that infants in rural areas have higher \\nlevels of exclusive breastfeeding and continued \\nbreastfeeding for the first and second year than \\ntheir urban

also seen within urban \\nareas. massive rural-to-urban migration\\n165\\n is \\ncreating ﬁhidden citiesﬂ of extreme poor urban \\npopulations, including over 800 million people \\nliving in slum

\\npopulations enjoy better health on average, \\nmoving to or living in an urban area does not \\nnecessarily guarantee this health for everyone, \\nand inequalities within urban populations are

\\nchildren now live in urban areas.\\n169\\n for poor urban households, food security \\nand nutrition are more dependent on families \\nhaving cash to buy food and meet other needs \\nthan in poor

caregivers have to spend more \\ntime outside home with potential consequences \\nfor childcare and feeding.\\n170\\n furthermore, access \\nto services such as health care, safe water and \\nsanitation is unequal.\\n171\\n alarmingly, the nutrition \\ntransition, which has seen shifts in consumption \\npatterns from traditional foods that are often \\nmore healthy to highly processed foods often \\nhigh in dietary energy, saturated fat, sugars and \\nsalt, is happening fastest in the urban areas of \\nlow- and middle-income countries, bringing \\nwith it increased risk of

populations, \\nare needed. these are particularly important in \\nthe face of economic slowdowns or downturns. \\nthey can protect the poor when public and \\nprivate expenditures in basic services are cut \\ndue to lack of fiscal space. and they can protect \\nthe poor from undesirable coping strategies with \\nnegative impacts on food security and nutrition, \\nas described in section 2.2. \\nas has already been shown, during economic \\ncrises, access to health care often deteriorates, \\nparticularly for poorer population groups.\\n174\\n government spending on publicly funded \\nhealth services is often reduced in real terms, \\nwhile healthcare demand tends to shift from \\nprivate to public services because of the lower \\ncost.\\n175\\n resource constraints during economic \\nslowdowns and downturns may result in \\nrestricted access to health care, availability, \\ncost and deterioration in the quality of services \\nprovided, especially among the poor and

education. during times of \\neconomic crisis, governments™ capacity to \\nfund education is often reduced, and families \\nmay be less able to invest in education. at the \\nsame time, resource constraints may negatively \\nimpact the quality of education.\\n178\\n again, these \\nconstraints disproportionately affect poor \\nand marginalized groups. unless there are \\ncontingency mechanisms and funds in place to \\nreverse such effects on education, there may be \\nlong-term effects on human capital and a higher \\nrisk that children are taken out of school so that \\nthey can contribute to a household™s income, \\nwith consequences for their nutrition, as further \\nexplained below.\\n179\\n| 97 |inequality in the distribution of productive assetsevidence shows that equitable access to assets \\nis a way through which economic progress for \\neveryone can be enhanced.\\n180\\n the greater the \\ninequality in asset distribution such as land, \\nwater, capital, finance, education and health, \\nthe more difficult it is for the poor to participate \\nin economic growth processes. this then slows \\nthe progress in reducing food insecurity and \\nmalnutrition. for example, poor people often \\nhave little education, which prevents them from \\nparticipating in labour markets that offer higher \\nwages. this in turn reduces the rate of overall \\neconomic growth, further harming the poor and \\nchallenging their food security and nutrition.\\nland-resource scarcity and inequities are \\ngrowing, with poor and marginalized population \\ngroups worldwide often having the least access \\nto land. they are confined to ﬁpoverty trapsﬂ \\nof marginal and degraded lands of poor quality \\nsoils, where they are vulnerable to climate \\nvariability and have no secure tenure.\\n181\\n women, \\nfor instance, make essential contributions to \\nagriculture in low-income countries; yet, they \\nhave less access to productive resources and \\nopportunities than men.\\n182\\neven in the context of sub-saharan africa, where \\narable land is relatively abundant as a whole \\ncompared with other regions, data at the country \\nlevel reveal that the amount of suitable land per \\nrural inhabitant varies considerably, and that \\nabout one-third of the countries have less than \\none hectare of land suitable for agriculture. \\nfurthermore, recent data on inequality of land \\ndistribution shows that surplus land in the region \\nis not only concentrated within relatively few \\ncountries, but that unequal distribution of land is \\nvery high in many countries (\\nfigure 37\\n).183\\ninequality in land ownership not only challenges \\nlivelihoods, but also undermines the productive \\ncapacity of the population. one study found \\nthat less inequality in land ownership across \\nagricultural populations, as opposed to inequality \\nwithin the landholding class, has been associated \\nwith greater public provision of education.\\n184\\n women often have no security of tenure or access \\nto financial credit.\\n185\\n they are disproportionately \\nrepresented among landless populations that \\nface food insecurity and are unable to meet basic \\nneeds. this often pushes them into wage farm \\nlabour and endangers their livelihoods (\\nbox 16\\n).186\\n like land access, water availability affects the \\nlivelihoods of billions

development.\\nmarginalization and social exclusionsocial exclusion is a dynamic process embedded \\nin unequal power relationships that operate \\nacross economic, political, social and cultural \\ndimensions. the economic dimension is \\ndefined by access to and distribution of \\nmaterial resources necessary to sustain life. \\nthe political dimension relates to power \\ndynamics and unequal patterns of both formal \\nrights and the conditions in which rights are \\nexercised, including access to services.\\n189\\n these dimensions also affect food security \\nand nutrition. \\ngiven this context, socially excluded and \\nmarginalized groups œ such as ethnic and \\nreligious minorities, indigenous populations \\nand people with disabilities œ are likely to be \\nhit particularly hard by economic downturns. \\nthese groups already have poorer access to \\nresources and essential services, and these \\ninequalities are likely to increase during \\neconomic crises.\\n190\\n indigenous populations around the world, for \\nexample, are often affected by poor food security \\nand nutrition. they frequently live in extreme \\npoverty and in environments that have been \\ndamaged; or they have lost their land and no \\nlonger have access to traditional food sources. \\nas a result, they are particularly exposed to \\ndifferent types of shocks, including climate and \\neconomic shocks (\\nbox 15\\n). \\nminority ethnic groups are often at higher risk \\nof different forms of malnutrition. children in \\nmost disadvantaged ethnic groups in low- and \\nlower-middle-income countries have on average \\n2.8 times the rate of stunting and six times \\nthe rate of wasting compared with their more \\nadvantaged peers, although the disparities are \\nmuch higher in some countries. additionally, \\nethnic disparities appear to be increasing in \\nmany countries.\\n191\\n people living with a disability \\nare also often more vulnerable to food insecurity \\nand malnutrition, and this relationship is \\nbidirectional through poor living conditions and \\nlack of access to health services.\\n192\\n although analyses are limited, data from \\nmore developed economies show that socially \\ndisadvantaged groups are often at increased \\nrisk of malnutrition. evidence from several \\nmiddle- and high-income countries suggests that \\nmothers from socially disadvantaged groups, \\nincluding ethnic minorities and indigenous \\npopulations, have a higher risk of giving birth \\nto babies of low birthweight\\n193\\n and of being \\naffected by anaemia.\\n194\\n furthermore, in low- \\nand lower-middle-income countries differences \\nin rates of childhood overweight between \\nethnic groups have been observed.\\n195\\n in some \\nhigh-income countries, rates of overweight and \\nobesity among children and adolescents have \\nbeen rising faster in minority ethnic populations \\nliving in low-income communities.\\n196\\n inequality within households inequalities of social, political and economic \\npower are not only seen within societies as a \\nwhole, but also within households. they can \\nmake economic events particularly beneficial for \\nsome, but not for all members of the household. \\nat the household level, differential inequalities \\nare determined by who has the power in \\ndeciding, for example, what is consumed.\\n197\\n ﬁbargaining-powerﬂ models within households \\nsuggest that incomes are rarely pooled \\ntogether.\\n198\\n consequently, gender inequalities \\nand power struggles tend to exacerbate poverty \\nand deprivation of food and nutritional security \\nduring periods of economic slowdown or \\ndownturn. such intra-household inequalities \\noften affect children negatively, depending on \\nfactors like gender, age, birth order, and mother™s \\nsocio-economic status.\\n199\\nthe allocation of food can be severely constrained \\nduring economic slowdowns and downturns and \\nthis can be particularly challenging for some \\nmembers of the household. more generally, while \\nno systematic bias at the global level has been \\nobserved towards one specific age or sex group \\nwithin a household concerning intra-household \\nfood distribution,\\n200\\n wide consensus posits that \\nwomen are disadvantaged in the allocation \\nof food (\\nbox 16\\n). also, pregnant women tend \\nto receive relatively lower allocations, with \\nlikelihood of serious consequences for their own \\nand their child™s nutritional status.\\n201\\n moreover, \\n  »| 99 |indigenous peoples are disproportionately represented \\namong food-insecure and hungry populations.\\n1 for \\ninstance, native americans in the united states of \\namerica are at least twice as likely to be food \\ninsecure as non-native americans.2 in guatemala, \\nindigenous children aged below five are twice as \\nlikely to be stunted compared to non-indigenous \\nchildren.3 similarly, indigenous peoples are \\ndisproportionately affected by the prevalence of \\npoverty. despite their contributions to economic \\nempowerment and social development, indigenous \\nwomen often face marginalization and discrimination \\neven within their own communities.4 while indigenous \\npeoples represent 5 percent of the world\\'s population, \\nthey represent 15 percent of the world\\'s poor.\\n5 in \\necuador, while the national poverty rate was \\n30 percent in 2012, it was at 60 percent for the \\nindigenous peoples.6 the prevalent loss of control over their territories \\nand resources have left indigenous peoples \\nimpoverished in many countries. resource-extracting \\ndevelopment models pose threats to their lands,7 especially in the absence of documented land rights \\nand tenure security. recent changes in economic \\nconditions, climate and access to natural resources \\nhave adversely affected their livelihood strategies, \\nwhich further exacerbates the prevalence of poverty, \\nfood insecurity and hunger among these groups. \\nindigenous peoples™ territories cover about \\n22 percent of the global surface and contain \\n80 percent of the world™s biodiversity.\\n8 because their \\nlands and territories have not been subject to intensive \\ndevelopment, they have been able to maintain \\nbiodiversity on these lands over millennia, which \\nis central to their livelihoods and natural resource \\nmanagement strategies.9 indigenous peoples™ traditional food systems \\ninvolve the production of diverse foods with minimal \\nnegative impact to the environment. these systems \\nare anchored in sustainable livelihood practices, \\nadapted to ecosystems of their territories, and are \\nrooted in biodiversity conservation which ensures \\nadequate dietary diversity.\\n10 many neglected and \\nunderutilized species that they cultivate are nutrient \\ndense, functional foods, rich source of micronutrients, \\nand have an untapped livelihood and nutritional \\npotential. for instance, marula, native in southern \\nand eastern africa, provides four times the content \\nof vitamin c contained in an orange. marula has \\nbeen promoted as a sustainable plant food for rural \\ndevelopment.11 indigenous peoples™ traditional farming \\npractices including diversification of land use, crop \\nrotations and crop diversification supports adaption to \\nclimate change. their diets from foods harvested from \\nforests to nutrient rich local fish, are diversified and \\nsuited to the local environments, and are a response \\nto malnutrition. \\ngreater attention to address the inequalities that \\nprevent harnessing the knowledge and nurturing \\nindigenous peoples™ traditional food systems, including \\nthrough increased access through the natural resources \\nthey rely upon, will facilitate making their dietary \\ndiversity more sustainable in the face of economic and \\nclimate shocks.1 i. anderson, b. robson, m.

nurturing \\ntheir dietary diversity\\n| 100 |women play an indispensable role in on-farm and \\noff-farm activities, particularly in rural areas, which \\ncontribute to economic welfare and food security of \\ntheir households. approximately 43 percent of the \\nglobal agricultural workforce is made up of women.1 the contribution of women to labour in african \\nagriculture is regularly quoted in the range of \\n60œ80 percent. using individual, plot-level labour \\ninput data from nationally representative household \\nsurveys across six sub-saharan african countries, \\nrecent evidence2 challenges the conventional wisdom \\nby estimating the average female labour share in crop \\nproduction at 40 percent. the evidence shows that this \\nshare was slightly above 50 percent in malawi, \\nuganda and united republic of tanzania, and \\nsubstantially lower in nigeria (37 percent), ethiopia \\n(29 percent) and the niger (24 percent). \\nthe agricultural productivity of women has direct \\nimplications on income as well as on the food security \\nof their households. evidence suggests that increased \\nincome for women is associated with greater food \\nconsumption and improved nutritional status of \\nhousehold members.3as economies grow and transform, new \\nopportunities emerge for rural populations. \\nimproved infrastructure and services, increased access \\nto education, information, credit, technology, technical \\nskills as well as improved access to agricultural \\nvalue chains and markets open up new economic \\nopportunities for both men and women. however, the \\nextent to which women and men are able to benefit \\nfrom these growing opportunities differs.\\n4 women often \\nface greater challenges in accessing input factors (i.e. \\nland, labour and financial services). for instance, less \\nthan 5 percent of women in north africa and west \\nasia are agricultural landholders. in sub-saharan \\nafrica, the proportion of women holding agricultural \\nland ranges widely from less than 5 percent in mali up \\nto 30 percent in botswana and malawi.1 further, many \\n  women face greater difficulty than men accessing \\nagricultural labour and formal financial services.\\n2 agricultural production outcomes also differ greatly \\nbetween men and women. there is evidence that \\nthe gaps in agricultural productivity between women \\nand men with similar-sized plots in a similar context \\nrange from 23 percent in united republic of tanzania, \\n24 percent in ethiopia, 25 percent in malawi, \\n33 percent in uganda, and to 66 percent in the \\nniger.\\n5 traditional roles also require women to spend \\nsignificant amounts of time on household chores and in \\ncaring for infants and young children, which limits their \\nparticipation in income-generating opportunities that \\narise when economies grow.\\n6 in developing countries, \\nestimates indicate that women spend three hours more \\nper day on unpaid work than men.2 finally, when \\nrural women migrate in search of greater employment \\nopportunities, they often face barriers seeking decent \\nwork, training opportunities, assets and personal safety.\\n7 however, narrowing the gender dimensions \\nof inequality goes beyond strengthening women\\'s \\neconomic opportunities and decision-making capacities \\nin groups and organizations. it also requires an \\nin-depth understanding of intra-household dynamics \\nwhere, in some parts of the world, men and women \\nwithin the same household pursue separate livelihood \\nstrategies. while women are typically disadvantaged \\nin terms of access to resources, services and markets, \\nand burdened by more onerous daily tasks, they \\nalso lack a voice in determining household priorities, \\nspending patterns and distribution of benefits. \\nthis includes gender inequalities in intra-household \\nfood allocation, which can result in a gender gap \\nin food and nutrition security.\\n8 consequently, what \\nhappens inside the family has substantial implications \\nnot only for individual motivation and well-being, but \\nalso for productivity and investments in agriculture and \\nrural development, and more importantly for food and \\nnutrition security within the household. \\n1 fao. 2011. \\nthe state of food and agriculture 2010œ11. women in agriculture, closing the

and rural areas\\n| 101 |studies done in some regions in south asia have \\nfound that in periods of critical food shortages, \\nthe highest inequity within households tends \\nto occur in households experiencing severe or \\nunexpected food insecurity.\\n202\\nincreasingly, evidence on associations between \\nintra-household inequalities and malnutrition \\nindicates that females score worse on nutritional \\nindicators compared with males. in bangladesh, \\nfor instance, household survey data reveal that \\nmen tend to have much smaller dietary energy \\nshortfalls compared with women.\\n203\\n of growing \\nconcern is the coexistence of underweight or \\nstunted children with overweight mothers \\nin the same households in various low- and \\nmiddle-income countries, such as bangladesh, \\nghana, india, kenya and peru.\\n204\\n this suggests \\nincreasing inequalities in economic and social \\naccess to resources. the combination of different \\ninequalities contributing to stunting and \\noverweight phenomena have been linked to \\nmaternal age at first birth, maternal short stature, \\nfamily size and socio-economic status.\\n205\\n  2.4\\n  policies for achieving \\nsustainable escapes \\nfrom food insecurity \\nand malnutrition in \\nthe context of \\neconomic slowdowns \\nand downturns key messages \\n responding to economic events that constrain \\nhouseholds™ purchasing power requires short- and long-term \\npolicy responses to safeguard food security and nutrition. \\nactions will depend on institutional capacity and availability \\nof contingency mechanisms and funds to respond. \\n countries need to protect incomes in the short term, \\nparticularly for the most affected households, through \\nsocial protection programmes, public works programmes, \\nor policies aimed at stabilizing food prices. at the same \\ntime, they need to avoid cuts in essential social services.\\n countries need to invest wisely during periods of \\neconomic boom to reduce economic vulnerabilities and \\nbuild capacity to quickly recover when economic turmoil \\nerupts. this requires balancing a set of policies for an \\ninclusive transformation that is characterized by economic \\ndiversification, human capital accumulation and universal \\naccess to health care and other social services.\\n given the rising importance of global trade in food and \\nagricultural commodities, trade policy also needs to feature \\nprominently in the minds of policymakers when promoting \\neconomic transformation that helps achieve food security \\nand nutrition objectives. \\n integrating food security and nutrition concerns into \\npoverty reduction efforts, while increasing synergies \\nbetween poverty reduction and hunger eradication, helps \\naccelerate both goals. \\n when implementing these policies, reducing gender \\ninequalities and social exclusion of population groups \\nneeds to be either the means to, or outcome of, improved \\nfood security and nutrition.\\n  »| 102 |the imperative of safeguarding food security and nutrition in the absence of policies and resilience \\ncapacity to face economic slowdowns and \\ndownturns when they occur, households \\nwill suffer a decline in their purchasing \\npower, either through income loss, higher \\ndomestic prices, or both. in attempting to \\nmeet their food needs with reduced budgets, \\nwhile perhaps also facing higher food prices, \\nhouseholds may resort to coping strategies that \\ncan further weaken their food security and \\nnutritional status. \\nwhile adverse economic conditions affect \\nfood security and nutrition in all countries \\nthrough the channels analysed in section \\n2.2, their impact was stronger in countries \\ndepending heavily on commodity imports \\nand exports in the most recent 2011œ2017 \\nperiod. moreover, as was also discussed \\npreviously, economic slowdowns and \\ndownturns have different impacts on \\ndifferent population groups, and their effects \\non food security and nutrition cannot be \\nseparated from the underlying factors of \\npoverty and inequality. \\nthis final section spells out potential policy \\nresponses to safeguard food security and \\nnutrition in the face of economic slowdowns \\nand downturns. it considers short-term policies \\nthat can directly and immediately tackle the \\nmain transmission channels from which the \\nimpacts of economic slowdowns and downturns \\nflow. in the longer term, the responses will \\nneed to be guided by a vision of development \\nthat fosters pro-poor and inclusive structural \\ntransformation, allowing countries to diversify \\ntheir economies and reduce their commodity \\ndependence, and ultimately lower their \\neconomic vulnerability. moreover, this section \\nmakes the case for the need to enhance the \\nsynergies among different policies towards \\nreducing poverty, inequalities, food insecurity \\nand malnutrition, as these phenomena are not \\neasily dissociated. \\npolicies to respond to the key transmission channels of economic slowdowns and downturns the main transmission channels linking the \\neffects of economic slowdowns and downturns \\nto food security and nutrition (\\nfigure 29\\n) feature \\nprominently in the earlier analysis of this second \\npart of the report for a very good reason: their \\nunderstanding is critical for policymakers to \\ndecide what to do when these economic events \\nbegin to appear. external events, including \\ncommodity price fluctuations, can have direct \\nimpacts through terms of trade, exchange rate \\nand balance of payments. secondary indirect \\neffects may arise through inflation and food \\nprices; unemployment, wages and income; and \\nhealth expenditures. food security and nutrition \\nwill be affected depending on the ability of \\nindividuals and households œ strengthened \\nby appropriate policies œ to cope with these \\neconomic events. \\nas shall be seen below, food security and \\nnutrition will ultimately be affected depending on \\nthe policy responses put in place to either bring \\nabout economic adjustment (e.g. through fiscal \\nand trade policies), or to help strengthen the \\nresilience of households to economic shocks, \\nand thus prevent undesirable coping strategies \\n(e.g. through social protection or social sectoral \\npolicies), or both. indeed, there needs to be a \\nunique set of policies to address the myriad of \\npotential transmission channels that economic \\nslowdowns and downturns present for food \\nsecurity and nutrition. known as countercyclical \\npolicies, these should aim at smoothing out the \\ncycles by targeting both the demand side and the \\nsupply side of the economy. some of these policy \\nresponses are discussed here, in relation to the \\nkey transmission channels. \\nat the same time, the following discussion \\nalso shows that, in addition to responding to \\nthe transmission channels, policymakers must \\ncontinue with some key existing policies for \\nnutrition and health, including maintaining the \\ndelivery and the quality of relevant care and \\nhealth services and ensuring universal access to \\nthose services as well as adequate access to water \\nand sanitation. these basic policies tend to be \\nhighly affected by cuts in social spending during \\n| 103 |economic slowdowns and downturns if there is \\nno contingency to prevent them.\\ncurbing rising food prices or offsetting their effects\\ninternational commodity price shocks and \\nvolatility transmit effects into the economy \\nthrough exchange rate adjustments, as \\nhighlighted before. declining commodity prices \\nhave resulted in currency depreciations and \\ndevaluations leading to domestic price increases. \\npolicy responses in the face of this trend are \\nboth short and long term in nature. in the short \\nterm, there may be actions to offset the effect on \\ndomestic price increases, particularly food prices. \\nin a different scenario, international food prices \\nmay rise, even if other commodity prices decline. \\nin the long term, policies will target the supply \\nside of the economy (to boost economic activity \\nand diversification) so as to face down the secular \\ndownward trend of commodity prices, as further \\nexplained below.\\ncountries that depend on food imports are \\nparticularly vulnerable to commodity price \\nfluctuations leading to an increase in food \\nprices. when these prices rise significantly, poor \\nhouseholds and those that are net food buyers \\ncan be highly affected. in most cases, the group \\nof net food buyers includes poor farmers, who \\nmay not be able to take advantage of the rise in \\nfood prices by increasing their production (and \\nearnings) and accessing markets.\\nto mitigate the negative impact of rising \\nfood prices on food security and nutrition, \\npolicymakers should consider different factors: \\nthe specific food items affected by the rising \\nprices; the distribution of households between \\nnet food buyers and sellers; the possibility \\nof substitution among different food items, \\nwithout negatively affecting the quality of diets; \\nand the potential negative effects of the policy \\nresponse itself.\\nthe most common policies that countries \\nimplement to promote food security and \\nnutrition in the context of rising food prices \\ncan be classified into three groups.\\n206\\n the first \\ngroup includes universal policies aimed at \\nreducing excessive volatility of food prices in \\nthe short term, such as restrictions on exports \\nof staple food items, use of food stocks to boost \\nthe food supply, consumption subsidies for \\ncertain essential food items, and import tariff \\nand consumption/sales tax cuts, among others. \\nwhile implementing some of these policies can \\nbe necessary for political reasons,\\n207\\n it should \\nbe stressed that they may not necessarily be \\nfirst-best policies. some of these measures can \\nbe rather costly if they provide a price subsidy \\nnot only to poor and vulnerable households, but \\nto the general population. they can also create \\npervasive market distortions and, in a trade \\ncontext, can create negative externalities for \\nother countries. \\nsocial protection measures and other policies \\naimed at protecting purchasing power and access \\nto social services constitute the second group. \\nsocial protection programmes play a critical \\nrole in both helping households avoid negative \\ncoping mechanisms and in accelerating recovery \\nafter adverse economic episodes, through the \\ncreation of new economic opportunities and \\nthe fostering of human capital in the long run \\n(box 17\\n). for example, homegrown school feeding \\nis a social protection strategy with proven effects \\nin preventing undesirable coping strategies \\n(box 18\\n). these measures aimed at producing \\npositive results in the short and long term may be \\npreferable to policies aimed at reducing excessive \\nvolatility of food prices. in many cases these \\nmeasures are targeted to those that most need \\nthem. but it is also important to ensure universal \\ncoverage to social services and social protection \\nas this protects families in times of economic \\ncrisis from having to decide whether to spend \\nmoney on food or health. \\nthe third group comprises medium- and \\nlong-term policies to boost domestic production \\nof food, such as free or subsidized input \\ndistribution, import-tariff or value-added tax \\ncuts on fertilizers and technology for agricultural \\nproduction, government-funded agricultural \\nresearch and extension activities, and \\nsubsidies for the adoption of new technologies \\nand irrigation. \\nthese policies need to be carefully designed and \\nimplemented to avoid unintended consequences. \\nfor example, consumer subsidies for staple food \\n(cereals, oil, sugar) in many countries of the \\nnear east and north africa region seem to be \\n  »| 104 |low-income countries are increasingly expanding their \\nsocial protection systems, particularly social assistance, \\nwhich may include social transfers and other \\nprogrammes that ensure access to social services, \\nsocial support and care services, in addition to \\nlegislation and policy reforms that ensure equity and \\nnon-discrimination. social protection plays a critical \\nrole in improving poor households™ access to food and \\nhealth care, which are essential for adequate nutrition, \\nparticularly for women and children.\\n1 cash transfer programmes are social assistance \\nprogrammes that are usually targeted at poor and \\nvulnerable groups.2 available evidence shows that \\nthese programmes improve household dietary diversity, \\nincrease food consumption3 and enhance productive \\ncapacity, with positive effects on the availability \\nof more and higher quality food.4 however, their \\nimpact on diet diversity among young children is \\nstill inconclusive,5 and likewise the evidence in child \\nnutritional status.6 potential explanations include \\nthe multidimensional nature of the determinants of \\nmalnutrition, which require multisectoral approaches \\nto see long-term changes; limited attention to explicit \\nnutrition goals and actions; and poor service quality, \\nwhich may explain the lack of overall nutrition \\nbenefits.7 studies suggest that programmes with larger \\nimpacts are those that have a larger transfer size and \\nare of long duration, are targeted at young children in \\nlow-income households, and include complementary \\nnutritional features.8in the humanitarian context, cash transfer \\nprogrammes are also being increasingly used. \\nan analysis of these programmes in over 62 \\ncountries9 finds that they can support access to food \\nand livelihoods, and prevent deteriorations in child \\nnutrition.10 launched in 2005, ethiopia™s productive safety net \\nprogramme (psnp) is one of the most important and \\nlargest social safety net programmes in africa.11  it contributes to both reducing poverty and strengthening \\nthe resilience of vulnerable households in the face of \\nrecurrent climate hazards and other shocks. the psnp \\nis the only social protection programme which has \\nconsidered food security and nutrition as well as \\ndisaster risk reduction in its design since its inception. \\nit is therefore a reference for other african countries on \\nshock-responsive social protection. it currently covers \\n8 million beneficiaries nationwide. most notably, the \\npnsp included a contingency budget equivalent to \\n20 percent of the base programme cost and a risk \\nfinancing facility designed to respond to transitory needs \\nof the chronically food insecure. when such contingency \\nwas exhausted, a risk financing mechanism (rfm) \\nwas developed. the financial facility and the rfm were \\ncrucial to the impact and effectiveness of the pnsp in \\nresponse to the 2011 horn of africa crises.\\n12 1 r.

slowdowns and downturns| 105 |promoting unbalanced diets, increasing the risk \\nof malnutrition and health among the population. \\npoor diets distorted by subsidies can contribute \\nto greater disease burden, lead to excess health \\nexpenditures of households and have economic \\nimpact on countries in terms of lost productivity \\nand foregone economic growth associated with \\nstunting and obesity.\\nduring periods of economic difficulty, children face the \\nrisk of being taken out of school to contribute to the \\nhousehold income as well as of having less access to \\nnutritious and balanced meals. homegrown school \\nfeeding, which features among a number of possible \\nsocial protection programmes, may help policymakers \\nto reduce this risk. this innovative approach˚links \\nschool feeding programmes with local smallholder \\nfarmers to provide millions of school children with \\nfood that is safe, diverse, nutritious and above all \\nlocal. nearly half the world™s school children, some \\n310 million, in low- and middle-income countries eat a \\ndaily meal at school, making this the most widespread \\nsafety net. moreover, homegrown school feeding can \\nnot only tackle food insecurity for school-age children, \\nbut can also provide income benefits to communities \\nat large.the last ten years have seen a growing global \\nconsensus that school feeding programmes generate \\npositive impacts, with the available evidence pointing \\nto multiple benefits.1 school feeding generates \\nhigh returns in four critical areas that translate into \\nhuman capital growth and sustainable development: \\nincreasing access to education, especially for girls; \\nimproving nutrition and health which, in turn, benefits \\ncognition and learning, especially for the most \\nvulnerable children; providing essential safety nets for \\npoor children and their families; and stimulating local \\neconomies, especially in the agricultural sector.\\nthe value of meals in school is equivalent to \\nabout 10 percent of families™ income. for families \\nwith several children, that can mean substantial \\nsavings. at the same time, this may also generate new \\neconomic activity. \\nlinking local consumption to local production \\nhelps create a stable and predictable market for \\nlocal farmers, especially smallholders, including \\nmany women and mothers. in brazil, for example, \\n30 percent of all purchases for school feeding come \\nfrom smallholder agriculture. another example of a \\nlarge-scale homegrown programme is in nigeria, \\nwhere 6 million locally sourced eggs and 80 tonnes of \\nfish are consumed by 9.2 million schoolchildren across \\nthe nation every week.\\nwith the schools as reliable markets, farmers earn \\nmore income, which they spend in other parts of the \\neconomy. as the process continues, school feeding \\nprogrammes create local income multipliers and \\nspillovers by linking the school feeding programmes \\nto caterers, traders, households, businesses and other \\nactivities in the local economy.\\n2 the homegrown \\nschool feeding programme in rural kenya, for \\ninstance, has a large income multiplier: each united \\nstates dollar (usd) transferred to a school for food \\npurchases creates an additional usd 2.74 of total \\nhousehold nominal (cash) income in rural areas. \\nin recognition of the importance of school feeding \\nprogrammes, many countries are including these \\ninitiatives in their strategies for achieving food security \\nand implementing the 2030 sustainable development \\nagenda. many governments are increasingly sourcing \\nfood for school feeding locally from smallholder \\nfarmers in a bid to boost local agriculture, strengthen \\nlocal food systems and move people out of poverty. \\n1 d.a.p. bundy, n. de silva, s. horton, d.t. jamison and g.c. patton, eds. 2018. \\nre-imagining school feeding: a high-return investment in human

particularly challenging during an \\neconomic slowdown or downturn if this leads \\nto cuts in public social protection spending due \\nto reduced government revenue. it requires \\nboth the existence of contingency mechanisms \\nand funds œ generated during periods of \\neconomic growth œ and adequate institutional \\ncapacity. the successful scaling up of the system \\ncontributes to protect poor and vulnerable \\nhouseholds, minimizing the likelihood that \\nthey use negative copying strategies with \\nlong-term consequences. \\nkenya™s hunger safety net programme (hsnp) \\nis an example of a flexible and scalable social \\nprotection programme that provides a rapid \\nresponse at times when the income of households \\nis affected.\\n210\\n during more stable times, \\n it functions like a standard social assistance \\nprogramme, delivering cash transfers to poor \\nhouseholds in northern counties of kenya. \\nhowever, the hsnp is also prepared to quickly \\nscale up its coverage to other vulnerable \\nhouseholds during climate shocks, like \\ndroughts.\\n211\\n for that purpose, the programme \\nhas registered all households living in high-risk \\nlocations and has opened a bank account for each \\nof them. using satellite data, an early warning \\nsystem indicates when an area is affected by a \\nsevere weather event, allowing the programme to \\nrespond by delivering additional cash transfers to \\nall the households in the affected areas. \\nanother important set of social assistance \\nprogrammes are public works programmes. \\nthese can be used as a short-term safety net \\nto protect the purchasing power of poor and \\nvulnerable households at times of economic \\nslowdowns or downturns.\\n212\\n unlike cash transfers \\n(box 17\\n), public works programmes do not require \\ndetailed information to identify their intended \\nbeneficiaries. they offer low-skill, low-paying \\ntemporary jobs, usually attracting those workers \\nthat are not able to find a job in the labour \\nmarket. through the generation of public jobs \\nin the construction and rehabilitation of local \\ninfrastructure, this kind of programme provides \\npoor households with a stable source of income \\nduring critical times and improves their access \\nto basic services in the longer term. there are \\nmany costs and implications in terms of design \\nand implementation, however, which should \\nboosting job creation and incomes the real economy responds to world and \\ndomestic price adjustments in various ways, as \\nnoted already. when sluggish economic activity \\nis the result, this will lead to unemployment, \\nloss of wages and, consequently, loss of income. \\nbefore policies can be put in place to achieve \\nthe structural transformations that can shield \\nthe economy against these external shocks, \\npolicymakers may need to resort to other types \\nof short-term responses to minimize or, even \\nbetter, fully offset the impacts on food security \\nand nutrition. \\nsocial protection programmes can enable \\ncountries to protect the poor and vulnerable in \\nthe event of an economic slowdown or downturn, \\nsafeguarding their food security and nutrition, \\nwhile also triggering other economic benefits. \\nthe example of school feeding illustrates the \\ndual functionality of social protection in terms \\nof improving food security and nutrition while \\npromoting local economic activity (\\nbox 18\\n). \\nbut social protection can also foster human \\ncapital in the long run, including through the \\nimpacts on food security and nutrition, while \\nenhancing the productive capacity of beneficiary \\nhouseholds (\\nbox 17\\n). and because social protection \\nis usually targeted towards poor and vulnerable \\ngroups, mainly through social assistance, it is a \\npolicy strategy than can tackle the inequalities \\nthat prevent many people from improving their \\nfood security and nutrition during economic \\nbooms œ as has been the case for some low- and \\nmiddle-income countries.\\n208\\n to enhance their impact and role, countries \\nare starting to develop risk-informed and \\nshock-responsive systems during times of \\nstability, strengthening certain mechanisms in \\norder to identify not only the poorest households, \\nbut also those which could be most affected and \\nin need of assistance when a shock occurs.\\n209\\n key features of these programmes include \\ncomprehensive social registries with information \\non poor and vulnerable households; and \\nearly-warning information systems to alert when, \\nand in what manner, a programme response \\nis required. to be effective, these programmes \\nshould be able not only to maintain the support \\nprovided at times of stability, but also to scale \\nup at times of economic slumps. however, this \\n| 107 |be taken into account when deciding on this \\ntype of intervention \\nvis-à-vis\\n unconditional \\ncash transfers, particularly in fragile and crisis \\ncontexts.\\n213\\nin some countries, for example the republic \\nof korea after the crisis in 1997, public works \\nprogrammes were implemented with the \\nmain objective of providing temporary jobs to \\nunemployed workers. in others, such as \\n sri lanka after the 2004 tsunami, programmes \\npursued a double objective: providing affected \\nhouseholds with a reliable source of income \\nand, at the same time, rebuilding community \\nand basic infrastructure to speed up the \\nrecovery. then there is the mahatma gandhi \\nnational rural employment guarantee scheme \\n(mgnregs), introduced by india in 2005, \\nwhich is the largest public works programme \\nin the world. unlike the previous cases, the \\nmgnregs was not designed to address \\nemployment problems arising from an economic \\ndownturn or to rebuild infrastructure damaged \\nby a natural disaster. building on the experience \\nof the state of maharashtra, the mgnregs \\ninstead guarantees up to 100 days of unskilled \\nmanual work on public projects during the lean \\nseasons, at the statutory minimum wage, to all \\nrural households. in this way, the programme \\nhelps rural households to stabilize their \\nearnings and to smooth their consumption all \\nalong the year.\\ninitial feasibility and subsequent sustainability of countercyclical policies one of the most important challenges faced \\nby policymakers at the time of economic \\nslowdowns or downturns is the limited amount of \\ngovernment resources to fund the implementation \\nof public policies. insufficient funding, or other \\npolitical priorities, can hinder the possibility of \\nmaintaining and scaling up the support provided \\nby the public sector to poor and vulnerable \\nhouseholds. establishing countercyclical financial \\nmechanisms to safeguard regular, risk-informed \\nand shock-responsive policies is fundamental \\nto increasing resilience of households during \\ncritical times. of course, this requires adequate \\ninstitutional capacity to capitalize on episodes of \\neconomic boom in order to have the finances on \\nhand when the situation becomes critical. \\nfirst and foremost, it is critical to strengthen \\nthe savings capacity of the economy before an \\neconomy slows down or contracts, so as to make \\ncountercyclical policies feasible in the first place. \\ncommodity-dependent countries, in particular, \\nwould need to save more during periods of high \\ncommodity prices, and rely more on a set of \\nexistent tools such as, \\ninter alia\\n, automatic fiscal \\nstabilizers, stabilization funds, sovereign wealth \\nfunds, macro-prudential norms, and the like. \\nhowever, more broadly, there should also be \\nactions to raise average saving rates in order to \\nmore durably insulate the stability of aggregate \\ndemand and avoid episodes of large (though \\ntemporary) real exchange rate appreciations. \\nby limiting the size of macroeconomic \\ndisequilibria and providing more breathing room, \\nhigher saving rates should help reduce the risks \\nof falling into restrictive policies, as has been the \\ncase in some countries.\\n214\\n this can be critical to \\navoid reductions in public expenditure in priority \\nsectors for food security and nutrition. \\nfiscal policy also provides other instruments \\nfor generating funding, provided implementing \\nreforms is fiscally and politically feasible. \\nthe available evidence\\n215\\n indicates that most \\ndeveloping countries should enact reforms that \\nsimultaneously enhance the redistributive impact \\nand improve the efficiency of fiscal policies. \\nthis would help generate additional fiscal space \\nto safeguard policies aimed at protecting food \\nsecurity and nutrition at the time of slowdowns \\nand downturns. on the tax side, developing \\ncountries may have room to increase the \\nmagnitude of tax revenues, and at the same time \\nimprove their composition (e.g. moving from \\nindirect consumption taxes to direct income \\ntaxes). on the spending side, fiscal space could \\nbe generated by avoiding the fragmentation or \\ninefficiency of social assistance programmes. \\nthe targeting of the different programmes \\ncould be improved as well, but this would \\nentail additional costs and requirements that \\nmight make it unfeasible if economic conditions \\nwere unfavourable.\\nwhen contingency funds are available, \\nprogrammes can be scaled up by, for example, \\nproviding extra support to current beneficiaries \\nand/or by including new households among \\nthe beneficiaries. two developing countries \\n| 108 |that were able to accomplish this in the past \\nare chile and colombia. in these cases, \\ncountercyclical spending was financed by \\nlowering overall spending in good times and \\nincreasing spending and/or borrowing in times \\nof economic downturns.\\n216\\n in the case of the state \\nof maharashtra in india, on the other hand, the \\nrural employment guarantee scheme is financed \\nwith taxes collected from the relatively richer \\nurban households.\\nin the absence of contingency funds, countries \\ncan prioritize social spending during economic \\ncrises to increase their redistributive impact and \\nprotect food security and nutrition. a suitable \\nalternative is refocusing policy responses towards \\nthose households most affected by the downturn \\nand, in this way, increasing the positive effect \\nof policies on food security and nutrition of the \\nhouseholds most in need. another alternative \\nis relying on contributions of partners and \\ndonors. this is the case of the hsnp in kenya, \\nalthough the agency in charge (the national \\ndrought management authority) is also working \\nto increase the contribution of different levels \\nof government.\\nfostering inclusive structural transformation to reduce economic vulnerability section 2.2 of this report shows that the group \\nof countries at higher risk of compromised \\nfood security and nutrition from economic \\nslowdowns and downturns is mostly \\ncomprised of low- and lower-middle-income \\ncountries with high commodity dependence. \\nnevertheless, commodity dependence may be \\noften unavoidable, particularly for countries \\nin the first stages of development and \\nstructural transformation. \\nthese countries should use the periods of \\ncommodity booms to invest wisely in order \\nto develop other sectors of the economy and \\nfoster human capital accumulation to reduce \\ninequalities and increase economic resilience. \\nduring these periods, these countries should \\nnot only ensure the adequate countercyclical \\nmechanisms discussed previously but also \\nimplement long-term development actions with \\na structural development pathway in mind.\\n217\\n this includes safeguarding and increasing \\nexpenditures on essential social services that \\nwill increase the resilience of households, \\nand decrease population vulnerability to food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition, as prioritized in the \\nsustainable development goals.\\n218\\nbalancing policies and investments for inclusive transformation\\nin pursuing a longer-term development \\nstrategy, countries will need to balance a set of \\npolicies and investments to achieve a structural \\ntransformation that also fosters poverty reduction \\nand more egalitarian societies: i.e. pro-poor and \\ninclusive transformation. during the early \\nstages of transformation, countries need to seek \\nbroad-based growth that is labour intensive \\n(especially for low-skilled labour), while \\ninvesting heavily in the generation of human \\ncapital to enable the development of highly \\nproductive sectors and the diversification of \\ntheir economies. \\nit is also important to understand labour markets \\nand balance the right policies to meet labour \\ndemand and supply. as noted earlier, export-led \\ngrowth strategies in latin america led to a \\nmore unequal income distribution, precisely \\nbecause of insufficient employment growth in \\nmodern sectors. there is evidence that investing \\nin human capital without sufficient creation of \\nskilled jobs results in high rates of unemployment \\n(particularly for youth) and skill mismatches \\nin the labour market, resulting in negative \\nrepercussions in terms of rising inequality of \\nincome and opportunities, and less poverty \\nreduction.\\n219\\n on the other hand, as economies \\ncontinue to grow, countries (like many in asia) \\nare confronted by the need to upgrade the \\nskills of their labour force to catch up with the \\nlabour demand of newly growing industries.\\n220\\n it is important to overcome sectoral and spatial \\nmismatches in the labour market looking at all \\nemployment possibilities (for example, through \\ngreen jobs, entrepreneurship, skill training, \\ndiversification of on-farm/off-farm activities, \\nand so forth) as well as incentives for sectoral \\nmobility and migration (including seasonal/\\ncircular migration). \\nlow- and lower-middle-income countries need \\nto develop and expand their social protection \\n| 109 |systems while they wait the required time to see \\ntransformation in their economies and reap the \\nrewards of investing in human capital. this may \\nstart from social assistance programmes that not \\nonly guarantee food security and a minimum \\nincome, but also support the poorest through \\nboth human capital accumulation and economic \\nparticipation in society.\\n221\\n as countries move \\nto more advanced stages of transformation, \\ndifferent types of social protection are needed \\nto permanently support people™s capacity to \\nmanage risk across the life cycle, moving from \\nsocial insurance towards contributory social \\nsecurity.\\n222 in this context, setting up measures to \\ninsure against setbacks to families, nations and \\nregions, due to disabilities, recessions, disasters \\nand disease, is another fundamental investment \\nfor safeguarding the progress made.\\n223\\n investing \\nin universal health coverage and primary health \\ncare is another important safeguard against such \\nsetbacks, and protects families from damaging \\nout-of-pocket healthcare costs that can push \\nfamilies into poverty. \\nfor transformation to be pro-poor and inclusive, \\nin addition to investments, key reforms are \\noften needed to enable more equal distribution \\nof resources and access to social services. \\nexamples of past reforms of this kind, and their \\npositive impacts, have been seen in several \\ncountries,\\n224\\n including the land reforms that \\ntransferred more land to poor farmers in the \\nrepublic of korea and taiwan province of china \\n(1940s to 1960s), and in viet nam (in the late \\n1980s and 1990s). china™s establishment of the \\nhousehold responsibility system (1979) that held \\nfarmers responsible for the losses and profits of \\ntheir agricultural activity boosted production and \\nalso massively reduced poverty in that country. \\nthe expansion of universal health insurance in \\nthailand (2000s) helped increase human capital, \\nthus facilitating the participation of the poor in \\nthe economy. \\nthe example of costa rica shows that moving \\naway from commodity dependency is indeed \\npossible. as noted earlier, this country has \\ndiversified its exports through trade reforms \\nand an export-led growth strategy. starting in \\nthe 1980s, it set up a number of initiatives to \\nstimulate the diversification of the economy, \\nincluding financial incentives (tax exemptions, \\nsubsidies, etc.) leading to the development \\nof so-called ﬁnon-traditional exportsﬂ (i.e. \\npineapples, cut flowers, shrimps and textiles), \\nwhich already in the 1990s had outpaced \\ntraditional exports (notably coffee and bananas). \\nat the same time, food-related manufacturing \\ndeveloped and export-processing zones helped \\nattract foreign direct investment inflows in \\nthe manufacturing and high-tech sectors. \\ngrowth in the services sector also contributed to \\nthe establishment of the strong tourism industry \\nthat exists today.\\n225\\n these transformations \\nbore fruit to a large extent also because \\nlarge investments had been made in human \\ndevelopment. costa rica™s education system has \\nbeen a pioneer among latin american countries, \\nand has played an important role in the country™s \\neconomic performance and in maintaining its \\ndemocratic stability.\\n226\\n the role of agricultural development is also \\nkey for reducing food-import dependence and \\nfor achieving structural transformation in both \\nlow- and middle-income countries.\\n227\\n countries \\nwith more suitable agricultural potential could \\ninvest to acquire a certain level of national \\nstaple production in order to lower food-import \\ndependency.\\n228\\n at the same time, however, these \\ncountries should also seek to develop other \\nsectors, capitalizing on initial investments in \\nagriculture and its related industries. for ﬁlate \\ntransformingﬂ low-income countries, where \\nindustrialization is lagging, agro-industrial \\ndevelopment and strengthened ruralœurban \\nlinkages have large potential for improving \\nlivelihoods and contributing to the eradication \\nof poverty.\\n229\\n investing to diversify and better \\nintegrate small-scale agriculture into markets \\nin low-income countries can lead to positive \\noutcomes in terms of income generation (\\nbox 19\\n), \\nwhich can potentially reduce poverty, food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition. encouraging more \\ndiverse diets and enabling the accessibility \\nof more diverse foods can help lower demand \\nfor food staples,\\n230\\n while stimulating the \\ndiversification of agricultural products, including \\nthat of local foods.\\n231\\n finally, designing policies \\nand interventions with a territorial perspective, \\nrecognizing the linkages of rural/agricultural \\nareas with small cities/towns and larger cities, \\ncan lead to more dynamic growth of economic \\nopportunities, including beyond agriculture.\\n232\\n   »| 110 |developing agro-industrial value chains opens up \\nmarket opportunities for small-scale farmers,\\n1 particularly in commodity-dependent countries such as \\nsao tome and principe, and senegal. sao tome and \\nprincipe exports cocoa, and senegal oil fuel, fishery \\nproducts and gold; both are highly dependent on food \\nimports.\\n2 commodity dependence makes them more \\nvulnerable to commodity price shocks. efforts by these \\ncountries to develop a sustainable and diversified \\nagricultural sector in recent years have included \\npolicies and programmes to increase access to \\nmarkets for small-scale producers (who make up the \\nmajority of these countries™ workforces) while \\nimproving the quality of agricultural production.3senegal™s agricultural sector accounts for \\n17.5 percent of its gdp.\\n4 the country has experienced \\nan economic slowdown since 2006, with its \\nagricultural sector facing several shocks that have \\nweakened its full potential. to address this challenge, \\nthe government stepped up investment in agriculture \\nto more than 10 percent of gdp annually beginning in \\n2009, and committed to transforming the agricultural \\nsector.\\n5 the agricultural value chains support \\nproject (pafa), for example, was implemented in the \\ngroundnut basin, a region that has suffered from \\nhigh levels of poverty and food insecurity following \\na decline in global groundnut prices. the project \\naimed to improve the rural livelihoods and incomes \\nof 16˚035˚households by integrating small-scale \\nproducers into profitable and diversified value chains, \\nand also to improve access to markets by establishing \\ncommercialization contracts with market operators. \\nthe project was successful in increasing production \\ncommercialization of crops that had mainly been \\ngrown for domestic consumption. it also helped farmers \\nto transition away from groundnut production, by \\ninvesting in poultry rearing and vegetable growing.\\n6 evidence from an impact assessment of the project \\nfound that as a result of pafa, crop income increased \\nby 48 percent, and total income increased by \\n11.3˚percent, within those households participating in \\nthe project.7 the experience of sao tome and principe \\nshows that inclusive rural transformation can \\nalso be achieved through strengthening linkages \\nbetween farms and markets, while also achieving \\npositive outcomes in food security and nutrition. \\nthe government launched the participatory \\nsmallholder agriculture and artisanal fisheries \\ndevelopment programme (papafpa) in 2003, \\nfollowed by the smallholder commercial agriculture \\nproject (papac) in 2015. this helped promote the \\ncommercialization of organic, high quality cocoa, \\ncoffee and pepper by creating farmer cooperatives \\nand establishing family plantations to increase \\nsales to domestic and export markets. results from \\nthe impact assessment of these programmes \\ndemonstrated positive and significant impacts on \\nagricultural incomes (an increase of 46 percent, \\n77˚percent of which was derived from cocoa, coffee \\nand pepper); and on dietary diversity (an increase \\nof 5 percent). another result of the project was an \\nincrease in take-up of organic certification among the \\nparticipants of the project.\\n81 t.

however, \\nagricultural transformation does not always \\nnecessarily meet food-security and nutrition \\nobjectives. besides the pro-poor nature \\nof transformation, the positive effects of \\nagricultural transformation on food security and \\nnutrition will depend on the type of commodities \\nand the quality of food that is generated under \\nthis process, and on fostering better access for \\neveryone to more nutritious foods.\\n233\\n the overlap \\nof policies for food security and nutrition with \\nothers seeking to foster economic development, \\nparticularly those with a focus on poverty \\nreduction, is further discussed in the last section. \\nfinally, an important point is that mobilizing \\ninvestments for achieving economic \\ndiversification requires effective political \\nleadership to address the related issues of \\ngovernance and the political economy of \\neconomic and social transformation. for example, \\ninvestment in human development in \\ncommodity-dependent countries, which are often \\nlow-income countries, tends to be low.\\n234\\n this is \\nexplained not only by lack of resources, but also \\nby the level of democratization of governments \\nand capacity of government institutions. \\nwhen democratization and institutional capacity \\nare lacking, it may result in some forms of \\nrent-seeking that impede economic growth (or \\nprevent countries from fully taking advantage \\nof commodity price booms) and create further \\nsocial inequalities. \\nmaking the most of trade for food security and nutritionwhile economic and export diversification and \\ndomestic market development are necessary to \\nreduce the external vulnerability that challenges \\nfood security and nutrition, import diversification \\nis also needed as part of a larger transformation, \\nincluding in food systems, towards healthier \\ndiets. therefore, international trade as a whole, \\nand the global, regional and unilateral policies \\nthat shape it, also need to feature prominently \\nin the minds of policymakers when promoting \\nthis transformation. \\nglobal, regional and unilateral trade policies are \\nmore important than ever. it was highlighted \\nearlier that a number of universal policies can \\nhelp stabilize food prices, including restrictions \\non exports of staple food items, or import-tariff \\ncuts. the latter can also boost domestic \\nproduction of food in the medium and long term. \\nhowever, the importance of trade policies extends \\nbeyond their role in stabilizing food prices and \\nboosting food production. these policies need to \\nbe carefully crafted to be among the triggers of a \\nsustainable transformation.\\nworld agricultural and food markets are \\nincreasingly integrated. this is largely driven by \\ntrade and investment policy, which influences \\nfood systems at global, regional and national \\nlevels, shaping aspects of food environments \\nsuch as food availability, prices, quality, and \\nfood-security and nutrition outcomes.\\n235\\nbroadly speaking, trade is good for food security. \\nby moving food from surplus to deficit countries, \\ntrade can ensure the availability and variety \\nof food, and promote access and stable prices. \\ntrade can also promote dietary diversity, which \\nis recognized as essential for adequate nutrient \\nintake and human health. for some countries, \\nespecially low-income ones, diets reflect the \\ndiversity of foods produced, such as in nepal.\\n236\\n at the same time, trade is associated with the \\nﬁnutrition transitionﬂ where diets become richer \\nin animal sourced foods, and highly-processed \\nfoods often high in fat, sugar and salt are more \\nwidely available as average income increases. \\nfor example, mexico™s exposure to food imports \\nfrom the united states of america explains four \\npercent of the rise in obesity prevalence among \\nmexican women between 1988 and 2012.\\n237\\n in spite of the benefits, policymakers still need \\nto be careful that trade policies and agreements \\nare not detrimental to nutrition objectives œ \\nespecially given that these policies rarely, if \\never, consider healthy diets as their underlying \\nrationale.\\n238\\n this is quite important, considering \\nthat global trade in food and agricultural \\ncommodities has increased significantly, so \\nthere is potential for it to contribute to nutrition \\nobjectives, as noted above. this will not only \\nrequire considering the impacts of trade policy \\non nutrition, but also enhanced coherence \\n  »  »| 112 |box 20trade policy, food systems, and food security and nutrition\\nsources: adapted from c. turner, a. aggawal, h. walls, a. herforth, a. drewnowski, j. coates, s. kalamatianou and s. kadiyala. 2018. concepts and critical perspectives for food \\nenvironment research: a global framework with implications for action in low- and middle-income countries. \\nglobal food security\\n, 18: 93œ101;

and malnutrition,  with a focus on poverty and inequalitiesas seen earlier in the report, the impact of \\neconomic slowdowns and downturns on food \\nsecurity and nutrition cannot be separated from \\npoverty and inequality issues. the interactions \\nbetween poverty and hunger and malnutrition \\n  »| 114 |form a vicious trap, where poverty is a cause \\nof hunger and where a lack of adequate and \\nproper nutrition is itself an underlying cause of \\npoverty.\\n239\\n however, poverty reduction strategies \\nand policies are not sufficient to reduce hunger \\nand malnutrition, including in the context of \\neconomic slowdowns and downturns, particularly \\nif important inequalities prevail. this last \\nsection looks at how multisectoral policies for \\nfood security and nutrition are linked to policies \\nfor the reduction of poverty and inequality. \\nit points to the importance of reinforcing these \\nwith specific actions, focusing particularly \\non nutrition.\\nhow does poverty reduction play a role and what \\npolicies can be strengthened? the disconnect between poverty alleviation and \\nimprovements in food security and nutrition \\nhas recently become more apparent, as seen \\nin section 2.3. several countries have made \\nsignificant progress in reducing poverty; \\nhowever, similar progress in food security and \\nnutrition has not been realized. \\nof course, the relationship between poverty and \\nfood security and nutrition is also complicated by \\nthe different ways in which these two phenomena \\nare measured, and by the limited research that \\nhas addressed both in a comparative manner. \\nmoreover, vulnerability to poverty and to food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition is also defined \\nthrough different concepts; thus, in practice, it \\nmay be difficult to identify which phenomenon \\nmanifests first in a given situation in order to \\nunderstand causal relationships.\\n240\\n for example, \\npoor households may go hungry after a period \\nof utilizing and depleting their resource base, \\nshowing poverty and vulnerability to food \\ninsecurity, but not actual undernourishment. \\nsimilarly, food may suddenly become physically \\nunavailable to a household due to a idiosyncratic \\nshock, even for non-poor households with the \\nresources to buy nutritious food. higher incomes \\ncan also increase food consumption, but this does \\nnot guarantee positive outcomes in nutrition.\\n241\\n from a policy perspective, these complexities \\nhave important implications. while similar \\npolicy instruments may apply in some cases \\nfor achieving both poverty reduction and food \\nsecurity, the specificities of food security and \\nnutrition should be emphasized and addressed \\nmore comprehensively.\\n242\\n table 12\\n helps explain \\nthe ways in which policies and actions for \\nreducing poverty can follow a more coherent \\nmultisectoral approach to food security and \\nnutrition, using the four pillars of food security. \\nthe table also highlights constraints that may \\nprevent the poverty reduction policies from \\nhelping to improve food security and nutrition. \\nsociocultural factors may play an important \\nrole for the feasibility of all these multisectoral \\npolicies; however, they can be rather context \\nspecific. the table, nonetheless, identifies some \\nof the cultural characteristics that generally act \\nas constraints to achieving outcomes in food \\nsecurity and nutrition.\\novercoming the constraints listed in \\ntable 12\\n requires looking at coherent integrated policies \\nfor poverty reduction and eradication of food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition. however, because \\nthe relationship between these phenomena may \\nbe bidirectional, actions towards sustainable \\nfood security and nutrition should also consider \\na long-term view of poverty reduction and \\neconomic growth, as well as resilience through \\npreparedness mechanisms and shock-responsive \\nsocial protection.\\na number of countries have been strengthening \\nfood security and nutrition outcomes in \\ntheir poverty-reduction interventions. \\nsocial protection (social assistance in particular) \\ncan help address some of the economic and social \\ndeterminants of malnutrition, including when \\ntargeting all nutritionally vulnerable populations \\nto food insecurity and malnutrition (including \\ninfants and young children, pregnant and \\nlactating women, people living with hiv/aids, \\nolder people, and those who are sick) or when \\nensuring that appropriate linkages with health, \\neducation and agriculture are strategically made \\nfor food security and nutrition. \\nnutrition-sensitive social protection (nssp) can \\nbe made possible by fostering policy coherence \\nacross these sectors, and by facilitating \\nprogrammes that integrate different components \\nlike social assistance (e.g. cash transfers), access \\nto nutrition education, health services, and \\nnutrition-sensitive agriculture.\\n243\\n for example, \\nsince 2013, lesotho has been working to \\n  »| 115 |table 12 \\nmultisectoral policies for reducing poverty, and the constraints that must be overcome \\n to improve food security and nutrition poverty reduction policies addressing each food security pillar\\nconstraints to achieving sustainable outcomes  in food security and nutritionphysical availability of food* promoting poor farmers™ productivity increases the \\nproduction and the availability of food for the poor at \\nthe national level; however, this depends on the potential \\nof the production frontier, type of crop and the market \\nwhere agricultural production is sold. \\n facilitating trade of food products allows poor consumers \\nto access food commodities at lower prices. supporting poor farmers™ food production may not \\nprovide enough food supply at national level because of \\nmarket failures or lack of supply response. additional policies in relation to food imports, trade and \\ninvestments (see box 20), utilization of food production, \\nand available stocks for emergency situations to supply \\nsafety net mechanisms may not be in place. \\neconomic and physical access to food** several poverty reduction policies aim to increase \\neconomic inclusion of the poor, which also expand their \\naccess to food and to productive resources (including \\nland and water) and markets; and provide support to \\nincrease productivity and develop other income-generating opportunities. \\n ensuring a minimum income can be achieved through: \\nsocial protection systems, work promotion programmes; \\nsupporting agricultural production of poor farmers and \\ntheir access to markets; and more broadly, rural \\ndevelopment programmes, investment in employment \\ngeneration, and developing entrepreneurship. supporting long-term investments in children™s education \\nand school feeding, and ensuring their access to \\nappropriate care and health services, also helps to \\nexpand their future economic prospects and reduce the \\nintergenerational transmission of poverty. \\n basic infrastructure and roads, particularly in rural \\nareas, and the development of markets in urban and \\nperi-urban areas facilitates physical access to food. \\n cultural characteristics related to gender and social \\ninequalities, as well as other behavioural aspects, could \\naffect equal access to food by all members in the \\nhousehold. they could also affect the prioritization of \\nfood, particularly of quality food, over other expenditures. \\nthese factors affect both poor and non-poor households. \\n supporting women™s economic empowerment, as part of \\npoverty reduction efforts, may present trade-offs in terms \\nof their time for breastfeeding, caring for infants and \\nyoung children, and food preparation. poverty-reduction \\nprogrammes often fail to address these constraints and \\nprovide additional support, including working with the \\nwhole household to reconsider existing gender roles and \\nshare household responsibilities; this can compromise \\nwomen\\'s nutritional well-being as well as that of their \\nfamilies. \\n raising the profile of traditional foods and ensuring their \\naffordability would also require that enhanced support is \\nprovided to poor farmers.\\n in urban areas, fostering more enabling environments for \\nhealthy food choices can be supported by zoning \\npolicies and social support systems, including safe \\nredistribution of unsold food for charities to improve \\naccess to healthy foods; promotion of urban agriculture; \\nand shorter food supply chains that reconnect cities to \\ntheir zones of influence. \\n in the absence of universal health coverage, poor health \\nand/or catastrophic out-of-pocket healthcare costs can \\nundermine achievement or a minimum income or reduce \\nexpenditure available for food.food utilization*** basic investments in the quality of diets; quality of health; \\neducation; and water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) \\ncan improve childcare and feeding practices, maternal \\nnutrition, dietary choices of consumers and food \\npreparation. together with improvements in information on the quality \\nof diets, these can help prevent diseases which can affect \\nfood utilization and exacerbate malnutrition. \\n more nutrition-specific interventions that address the \\nimmediate causes of malnutrition, and some of its \\nunderlying causes (e.g. lack of nutrition education) are \\noften not seen as part of poverty reduction strategies.\\n the food accessible to the poor, but also the non-poor, \\nmay be suboptimal for improved nutrition and health. \\nmicronutrient deficiencies are often more prevalent \\namong the poor. \\n there are other issues related to the microbiome and its \\nimpact on food and agriculture, which simultaneously \\naffect human nutrition. \\n women™s lack of empowerment and intra-household \\ngender relations, and women™s lack of knowledge and \\nunderstanding of nutritional issues jeopardize utilization.|

complements the existing national \\ncash transfer programme, the child grant \\nprogramme (cgp), with home gardening and \\nnutrition kits and training, paying special \\nattention to those households most affected \\nby drought, which are not only poor but also \\nvulnerable to food insecurity. rigorous impact \\nevaluations of the cgp and of additional \\ninterventions have provided strong evidence \\nthat, when all these elements are combined, \\na stronger impact in reducing poverty and \\nnutrition is simultaneously achieved.\\n244\\nhowever, these efforts will not be enough to \\nprotect food security and nutrition, particularly \\nduring periods of economic slowdowns and \\ndownturns, if the multisectoral approach does \\nnot address determinants of nutrition such as \\nfood security, care, health, and water, sanitation \\nand hygiene (wash). the health system is \\nthe primary channel through which to address \\nsome of these determinants.\\n245\\n in recent years, \\nethiopia, uganda and the united republic of \\ntanzania have all been working to scale up their \\nnutrition interventions in this regard. these three \\ncountries have focused on essential maternal, \\ntable 12 \\n(continued)infant and young child nutrition during the first \\n1˜000 days. in ethiopia, local evidence convinced \\npolicymakers of the need to address anaemia \\namong adolescent girls. in uganda, participatory \\ndistrict assessments brought stakeholders \\ntogether around evidence-informed nutrition \\nactions. and in the united republic of tanzania, \\ndistrict-level investments for nutrition increased \\nwhen capacity was developed for planning and \\nbudgeting.\\n246\\n universal interventions for food \\nsecurity and nutrition like these are necessary in \\norder to avoid leaving out not only the poor but \\nalso several other, non-poor populations who \\nmay be at risk of food insecurity. \\neconomic and social inequalities impede progress in \\nfood security and nutritioninequality can limit opportunities for \\nhouseholds to escape poverty, food insecurity \\nand malnutrition. because of income inequality, \\nthe poor are not able to benefit from economic \\nbooms œ as they disproportionally accrue less \\nincome compared to others œ and nor do they \\nhave sufficient income streams to better cope \\nduring episodes of economic difficulty. but, as \\nnoted earlier, finding sustained escapes from \\nfood insecurity, malnutrition and poverty also \\ndepends on having adequate access to basic \\nservices, in particular: care, health and wash. \\nunfortunately, there are still great inequalities \\npoverty reduction policies addressing each food security pillar\\nconstraints to achieving sustainable

for \\nthe existing gaps need to be further analysed, \\nincluding from a perspective of political economy \\nand corruption prevention. \\nthe stark inequalities that are observed between \\nurban and rural areas in some developing \\ncountries demonstrate how processes of \\neconomic growth and transformation can be \\nunequal. poverty reduction and development \\nefforts need to focus more on raising \\nagricultural productivity and rural incomes, \\ngenerating wider employment opportunities \\nand integrating rural areas more effectively \\ninto mechanisms of national economic \\ndevelopment. in doing so, it is important to \\nconceive rural development as an endeavour \\nthat involves other actions beyond agriculture. \\nin the twenty-first century, rurality cannot be \\nseen to be synonymous with decline, as this \\nview risks neglecting essential opportunities \\nfor economic growth and social development. \\nthe revalorization of rural spaces is needed, \\nand with that, the adoption of rural policies that \\nleverage regional assets rather than exclusively \\npursuing a compensatory approach.\\n247\\n at the \\nsame time, there is a need to increase the \\nresilience and address the food security and \\nnutrition needs of urban residents living in \\nextreme poverty, including by creating healthier \\nfood environments and by ensuring that the \\nurban poor are able to access wash services \\nfrom which, despite better urban provision, they \\nare often excluded.\\noften, inequality is nested within the household, \\nwith gender inequalities still persistent across all \\nregions, and in both developed and developing \\ncountries. as seen in the previous sections and \\nin section 1.1 in part 1, women are at higher \\nrisk of undernourishment than men, and women \\nof reproductive age tend to be more vulnerable \\nto food insecurity and malnutrition. in order \\nto reduce gender inequalities, more dedicated \\nand comprehensive policies and development \\napproaches are required that specifically target \\nwomen™s economic empowerment and nutrition. \\nintegrated approaches for women could include \\naccess to reproductive health services and \\nnutrition services, care services, skills training \\nand access to employment, maternity protection \\nand social protection. in addition to assets \\nand access to basic services, these approaches \\nshould directly address gender inequalities by \\nfocusing on the people involved: understanding \\nwho they want to be, what they want to do, and \\nhow they can achieve their goals using a joint \\nvision and practical strategy.\\n248\\n at the same time, \\nthis requires understanding human behaviour, \\nfostering community awareness, and identifying \\neffective incentives for women to access services \\nand support. \\nbeyond gender inequalities, other social \\ninequalities derived from discrimination \\nand exclusion of population groups based \\non ethnicity, caste or religion œ also noted \\nearlier œ hamper any potential advancement \\nin ensuring food security and good nutrition. \\nsocial discrimination and exclusion of these \\npopulation groups can be reversed only \\nthrough policies and social mobilization to \\naddress the multiple challenges they face. \\nthere are a number of possible actions to this \\nend, including: legal, regulatory and policy \\nframeworks to promote social inclusion; \\nnational public expenditure; improving access \\nto and adequacy of public services (sometimes \\nexclusively targeted to these population \\ngroups); empowering institutions, their \\norganizational capacity and their participation \\nin decision-making processes; increasing \\naccountability to protect human rights; and \\nworking to gradually change discriminatory \\nattitudes and behaviours.\\n249\\n 2.5\\n  conclusionsthis year™s report continues to signal the \\nsignificant challenges that remain in the \\nfight against hunger, food insecurity and \\nmalnutrition in all its forms. part 2 calls for \\nbolder actions to address these challenges in the \\nface of economic slowdowns and downturns. \\nthe latest global economic prospects warn of \\nslowing and stalled economic growth in many \\ncountries, including emerging and developing \\neconomies. episodes of financial stress, \\nelevated trade tensions, declining commodity \\nprices, and tightening financial conditions \\nare all contributing to these increasingly \\ngrim prospects. \\n| 118 |part 2 has presented new evidence \\nconfirming that:\\n hunger has been on the rise for many \\ncountries where the economy has slowed \\nor contracted œ strikingly, the majority of \\nthese are not low-income countries, but \\nmiddle-income countries; \\n economic shocks are prolonging and worsening \\nthe severity of acute food insecurity, in food \\ncrisis countries; \\n economic slowdowns tend to be sharper and \\neconomic contractions deeper and longer \\nlasting for commodity-dependent countries; \\nand \\n economic events generally have a harsher \\neffect on food security and nutrition when \\nextreme poverty and inequalities are greater. \\ninequalities in income and in access to basic \\nservices and assets, as well as social exclusion \\nand marginalization of groups, are preventing \\nlarge numbers of people from reaping benefits \\nduring times of strong economic growth, or from \\ncoping adequately during periods of economic \\nslowdowns or downturns. the new evidence in \\npart 2 points to the fact that these slowdowns \\nand downturns disproportionally undermine \\nfood security and nutrition where inequalities are \\ngreater, particularly in middle-income countries. \\nincome and wealth inequalities are also closely \\nassociated with undernutrition, while more \\ncomplex inequality patterns are associated with \\nobesity. therefore, reducing these inequalities \\nmust be a primary goal, either as a means to \\nimproving food security and nutrition, or as an \\noutcome of doing so.\\nthe report calls for action on two fronts to \\nsafeguard food security and nutrition from \\neconomic slowdowns and downturns. in the short \\nterm, countries need to protect incomes so as to \\ncounteract economic adversity. to enhance the \\ncontingency mechanisms and financial capacity \\nthat policymakers need to respond, it is critical to \\nstrengthen savings capacity when the economy is \\ngrowing, using available instruments (automatic \\nfiscal stabilizers, stabilization funds, sovereign \\nwealth funds, macro-prudential norms, and \\nthe like), so as to make countercyclical policies \\nfeasible. policies may include targeted social \\nprotection programmes, including conditional \\nor unconditional cash transfers and school \\nfeeding; public works programmes that help \\nreduce unemployment; or policies aimed at \\nstabilizing food prices, and protecting incomes \\nfrom damaging out-of-pocket healthcare costs \\nby ensuring full coverage of essential health \\nservices. the potential unintended consequences \\nfor nutrition must be carefully considered \\nthroughout, and cuts to essential social services, \\nincluding health, must be avoided at all costs. \\nin the longer term, countries need to invest \\nwisely during periods of economic booms to \\nreduce economic vulnerabilities and build \\ncapacity to withstand and quickly recover when \\neconomic turmoil erupts. this requires balancing \\na set of policies and investments to achieve \\nan inclusive structural transformation that \\ndiversifies the economy away from commodity \\ndependence, while also fostering poverty \\nreduction and more egalitarian societies.\\nthis includes transforming agriculture and food \\nsystems such that the type of commodities and \\nthe quality of food that they produce contribute \\nto improving access to more nutritious foods \\nfor all. measures to increase dietary diversity \\nand to create healthier food environments are \\nrequired to prevent economic slowdowns or \\ndownturns from undermining the nutritional \\nquality of diets. policymakers must ensure \\nthat facilitating trade access does not have \\nunintended negative consequences for food \\nsecurity and nutrition in sectors that would in \\nprinciple be affected by the increase in trade \\naccess. integrating food security and nutrition \\nconcerns into poverty reduction efforts, while \\nincreasing synergies between poverty reduction \\nand hunger eradication, must also be part of \\nthe transformation. \\nensuring that this transformation is pro-poor \\nand inclusive will not be possible by focusing on \\neconomic growth alone: it will require tackling \\nexisting inequalities at all levels, through \\nmultisectoral policies that keep these inequalities \\nas the central focus. ultimately, this kind of \\ntransformation will only materialize if policies \\neffectively strengthen the economic resilience \\nof countries to safeguard food security and \\nnutrition at those times when the economy slows \\nor contracts. \\n| 119 |mexico\\na participant in an \\nfao-supported food security \\nproject working at his fruit \\nand vegetable stall.\\n©alex webb/magnum \\nphotos for

\\nundernourishment\\ndefinition:\\n undernourishment is defined as the \\ncondition of an individual whose habitual food \\nconsumption is insufficient to provide, on \\naverage, the amount of dietary energy required to \\nmaintain a normal, active, healthy life.\\nhow it is reported:\\n the indicator is reported as a \\nprevalence and is denominated as ﬁprevalence \\nof undernourishmentﬂ (pou), which is an \\nestimate of the percentage of individuals in \\nthe total population that are in a condition \\nof undernourishment. national estimates \\nare reported as three-year moving averages, \\nto control for the low reliability of some of \\nthe underlying parameters, due for example \\nto difficulties in capturing the year-to-year \\nvariation in food commodity stocks, one of the \\ncomponents of the annual food balance sheets, \\nfor which complete, reliable information is very \\nscarce. regional and global aggregates, on the \\nother hand, are reported as annual estimates, \\non account of the fact that possible estimation \\nerrors are expected not to be correlated \\nacross countries.\\nmethodology:\\n to compute an estimate of the \\nprevalence of undernourishment in a population, \\nthe probability distribution of habitual dietary \\nenergy intake levels (expressed in kcal per \\nperson per day) for the average individual is \\nmodelled as a parametric probability density \\nfunction (pdf), \\nf(x)\\n. the indicator is obtained \\nas the cumulative probability that the habitual \\ndietary energy intake (\\nx) is below the minimum \\ndietary energy requirements (mder) (i.e., the \\nlowest limit of the range of energy requirements \\nfor the population™s representative average \\nindividual) as in the formula below:\\npou = \\n˜x<mder\\n f(x|˚)dx,\\nwhere \\n˚ is a vector of parameters that \\ncharacterizes the pdf. the distribution is assumed \\nto be lognormal, and thus fully characterized \\nby only two parameters: the mean dietary \\nenergy consumption (dec), and its coefficient \\nof variation (cv). in a few exceptional cases, a \\nthree-parameter skew-normal or skew-lognormal \\ndistribution is considered.\\n1data sources:\\n different data sources are used to \\nestimate the different parameters of the model.\\nminimum dietary energy requirement (mder): \\nhuman energy \\nrequirements for an individual in a given sex/age \\nclass are determined on the basis of normative \\nrequirements for basic metabolic rate (bmr) per \\nkilogram of body mass, multiplied by the ideal \\nweights that a healthy person of that class may \\nhave, given his or her height, and then multiplied \\nby a coefficient of physical activity level (pal) to \\ntake into account physical activity.\\n2 given that \\nboth healthy bmis and pals vary among active \\nand healthy individuals of the same sex and age, \\na range\\n of energy requirements applies to each \\nsex and age group of the population. the mder \\nfor the average individual in the population, \\nthat is the parameter used in the pou formula, \\nis obtained as the weighted average of the lower \\nbounds of the energy requirement ranges for \\neach sex and age group, using the shares of the \\npopulation in each sex and age group as weights.\\ninformation on the population structure by sex \\nand age is available for most countries in the \\nworld and for each year from the un department \\nof economic and social affairs (desa) \\npopulation prospects, revised every two years. \\nthis edition of sofi uses the 2017 revision of the \\nworld population prospects.\\n3information on the median height in each sex \\nand age group for a given country is derived from \\na recent demographic and health survey (dhs) \\nor from other surveys that collect anthropometry \\ndata on children and adults. even if such surveys \\ndo not refer to the same year for which the \\npou is estimated, the impact of possible small \\nintervening changes in median heights over \\nthe years on pou estimates are expected to \\nbe negligible.\\nannex 1\\n| 148 |dietary energy consumption (dec), coefficient of variation \\n(cv) and skewness (skew): \\nwhen reliable data on \\nfood consumption are available from nationally \\nrepresentative household surveys that collect \\ninformation on food consumption (such as, \\nliving standard measurement surveys or \\nhousehold incomes and expenditure surveys), \\nthe parameters that describe the distribution of \\naverage daily dietary energy requirement in the \\npopulation can be estimated directly.\\nhowever, only very few countries conduct such \\nsurveys on an annual basis. this necessitates \\nestimating them indirectly, or imputing them \\nfor the years when no suitable survey data \\nare available. in such cases, dec values are \\nestimated from the dietary energy supply (des) \\nreported in the food balance sheets (fbs), \\ncompiled by fao for most countries in the world \\n(see \\nhttp://www.fao.org/economic/ess/fbs/en\\n). \\nthis year, the fbs series were updated for the \\nfollowing 53 countries with the largest number \\nof undernourished people, bringing them up to \\ndate through 2017: afghanistan, algeria, angola, \\nbangladesh, bolivia (plurinational state of), \\nburkina faso, cambodia, cameroon, central \\nafrican republic, chad, china (mainland), \\ncolombia, congo, c\\nôte d™ivoire, democratic \\npeople™s republic of korea, democratic republic \\nof the congo, ecuador, ethiopia, guatemala, \\nguinea, haiti, india, indonesia, iraq, kenya, \\nmadagascar, malawi, mexico, mozambique, \\nmyanmar, nepal, niger, nigeria, pakistan, peru, \\nphilippines, rwanda, senegal, sierra leone, \\nsouth africa, sri lanka, sudan, syrian arab \\nrepublic, tajikistan, thailand, uganda, united \\nrepublic of tanzania, uzbekistan, venezuela \\n(bolivarian republic of), viet nam, yemen, \\nzambia and zimbabwe.\\nin addition, fbs series for 28 european \\nhigh-income countries were updated \\nthrough 2016.\\nfbs are of no use to estimate the cv, as they \\nprovide no information on the \\ndistribution\\n of \\nfood consumption within a population. in the \\npast fao had made attempts at estimating the \\ncv as a function of macroeconomic variables, \\nsuch as per capita gdp, inequality in income \\n(captured by the gini index) and an index of \\nthe relative price of food.\\n4 however, the ability \\nto correctly project the cv of habitual food \\nconsumption in a population with such model \\nis questionable, due to the sparsity of data on \\nthe gini index and to reservations on the way \\nin which the index of the relative price of food \\nis compiled. it was therefore decided to revert \\nto a simpler (and arguably more robust) method \\nto linearly interpolate values of the cvs in the \\nyears between surveys. the main drawback of \\nsuch modelling choice is that, when only one \\nsurvey is available over the monitored period, \\nthe resulting value of the cv is kept constant \\nover the entire period of assessment, and in \\nany case from the year of last available survey \\nup to the year 2015. possible changes over \\ntime in the ability to access food by different \\nstrata of the population that are not fully \\nreflected in changes in the average national \\nfood consumption are therefore not captured in \\npou estimates.\\npou projections for 2018: \\nusing the methods \\ndescribed above, pou estimates are produced \\nfor all countries for which reliable fbs data are \\navailable up to 2017.\\nto generate national level three-year averages for \\n2016\\nœ18 and annual values at regional and global \\nlevel in 2018, projections are needed.\\nas in the past editions of sofi, pou estimates \\nfor the current year are obtained by separately \\nprojecting each of the model™s parameters, and by \\napplying the pou formula presented above to the \\nprojected parameters.\\nprojection of the dec.\\n the latest available data \\nfrom national food balance sheets for most \\ncountries refer to a year between 2013 and 2017. \\nto estimate a value of dec for up to 2018, data \\non the per capita availability of cereals and \\nmeats, available from fao\\'s trade and markets \\ndivision,\\n5 are used to estimate the likely rates of \\nchange in per capita dietary energy availability \\nfrom 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 or 2017 (depending \\non the country) to 2018. such rates of change are \\nthen applied to the latest available dec values to \\nproject them up to 2018.\\n| 149 |annex 1\\nprojection of the cv.\\n until recently, the cv \\nestimated for a country from last available food \\nconsumption survey data was always projected \\nahead with no change. since 2014, however, \\nfies data provide evidence on recent changes in \\nthe extent of severe food insecurity that might \\nclosely reflect changes in the pou. to the extent \\nthat such changes in pou are not explained by \\nchanges in average food supplies, they can thus \\nbe used to infer the likely changes in the cv \\nthat might have occurred in the most recent \\nyear. analysis of the combined set of historic \\npou estimates reveals that, on average, and \\nonce differences in dec and mder have been \\ncontrolled for, cvs explain about one-third of \\nthe differences in pou across time and space. \\npossible changes in the cv from 2017 to 2018, to \\nbe considered in addition to projected changes in \\ndec described above, are thus imputed based on \\nthe results of an

\\naccess to food, \\nat the \\nlevel of individuals or households, due to lack of \\nmoney or other resources\\n. the \\nseverity of food \\ninsecurity is measured using data collected with \\nthe \\nfood insecurity experience scale survey \\nmodule\\n (fies-sm), a set of eight questions \\nasking individual or households to self-report \\nconditions and experiences typically associated \\nwith limited access to food. \\nusing sophisticated statistical techniques \\nbased on the rasch measurement model, the \\ninformation obtained in a survey is validated \\nfor internal consistency and converted into \\na quantitative measure along a scale of \\nseverity, ranging from low to high. based on \\ntheir responses to the fies-sm items, the \\nindividuals or households interviewed in \\n| 150 |a nationally representative survey of the \\npopulation are assigned a probability to be \\nin one of three classes: food secure or only \\nmarginally insecure; moderately food insecure; \\nand severely food insecure as defined by \\ntwo globally set thresholds. based on fies \\ndata collected over three years from 2014 to \\n2016, fao has established the fies reference \\nscale, which is used as the global standard for \\nexperience-based food-insecurity measures \\n(box 3\\n), and to set the two reference thresholds \\nof severity.\\nsdg indicator 2.1.2 is obtained as the cumulated \\nprobability to be in either one of the two \\nclasses of moderate and severe food insecurity. \\na separate indicator (fi\\nsev\\n) is computed by \\nconsidering only the severe food-insecurity class.\\nhow it is reported:\\n in this report,\\n fao provides \\nestimates of food insecurity at two different \\nlevels of severity: moderate or severe food \\ninsecurity (fi\\nmod+sev\\n) and severe food insecurity \\n(fi\\nsev\\n). for each of these two levels, two \\nestimates are reported:\\n the \\nprevalence (%) of individuals\\n in the \\npopulation living in households where at least \\none adult was found to be food insecure;\\n the estimated \\nnumber of individuals\\n in the \\npopulation living in households where at least \\none adult was found to be food insecure.\\ndata source:\\n since 2014, the eight-question fies \\nsurvey module has been applied in nationally \\nrepresentative samples of the adult population \\n(defined as aged 15˜or older) in more than \\n140˜countries included in the gallup\\n® world \\npoll (gwp), covering 90˜percent of the world \\npopulation. in most countries, samples include \\nabout 1˜000˜individuals, with larger samples \\nof 3˜000˜individuals in india and 5˜000˜in \\nmainland china. \\nfor burkina faso, cabo verde, canada, chile, \\necuador, ghana, indonesia, israel, kenya, \\nmalawi, nigeria, palestine, republic of korea \\n(2014 and 2015), russian federation (2016, 2017 \\nand 2018), saint lucia, seychelles, and united \\nstates of america, national government survey \\ndata were used to calculate the prevalence \\nestimates of food insecurity by applying fao™s \\nstatistical methods to adjust national results to \\nthe same global reference standard.\\nmethodology:\\n the data were validated and used \\nto construct a scale of food-insecurity severity \\nusing the rasch model, which postulates that the \\nprobability of observing an affirmative answer by \\nrespondent \\ni to question \\nj is a logistic function of \\nthe distance, on an underlying scale of severity, \\nbetween the position of the respondent, \\nai, and \\nthat of the item, \\nbj. by applying the rasch model to the fies data, it \\nis possible to estimate the probability of being \\nfood insecure \\n(pi,l\\n) at each level of severity of \\nfood insecurity \\nl (moderate or severe, or severe), \\nfor each respondent \\ni, with \\n0 < p i,l\\n < 1. the prevalence of food insecurity\\n at each level \\nof severity (\\nfil) in the population is computed \\nas the weighted sum of the probability of being \\nseverely food insecure for all respondents (\\ni) in \\na sample: \\nfil = ˜p\\ni,l\\nwiwhere \\nwi are post-stratification weights \\nthat indicate the proportion of individuals \\nor households in the national population \\nrepresented by each record in the sample.\\nas only individuals aged 15 or more are \\nsampled in the gwp, the prevalence \\nestimates directly produced from these data \\nrefer to the population 15˜years and older. \\nto arrive at the \\nprevalence and number of \\nindividuals (of all ages) in the population\\n, an \\nestimate is required of the number of people \\nliving in the households where at least \\none adult is estimated to be food insecure. \\nthis involves a multistep procedure detailed \\nin annex˜ii of the \\nvoices of the hungry \\ntechnical report\\n (see link in the ﬁreferencesﬂ \\nsection, below). \\nprob\\n(xi,j\\n = yes)\\n =   exp(\\nai œ bj)1 + exp(\\nai œ bj)| 151 |annex 1\\nregional and global aggregates\\n of food insecurity \\nat moderate or severe, and severe levels, \\nfil, are \\ncomputed as: \\nwhere \\nr indicates the region\\n, fi\\nl,c is the value \\nof fi at level \\nl estimated for country \\nc in the \\nregion and \\nnc is the corresponding population \\nsize. when no estimate of \\nfil is available for \\na country, it is assumed to be equal to the \\npopulation-weighted average of the estimated \\nvalues of the remaining countries in the same \\nregion. a regional aggregate is produced \\nonly if the countries for which an estimate \\nis available cover at least 50˜percent of the \\nregion™s population.\\nuniversal thresholds are defined on the fies \\nglobal standard scale (a set of item parameter \\nvalues based on results from all countries \\ncovered by the gwp in 2014œ16) and converted \\ninto corresponding values on local scales. \\nthe process of calibrating each country™s scale \\nagainst the fies global standard can be referred \\nto as \\nequating\\n, and permits the production \\nof internationally comparable\\n measures \\nof food-insecurity severity for individual \\nrespondents, as well as comparable national \\nprevalence rates.\\nthe problem stems from the fact that, when \\ndefined as a \\nlatent \\ntrait, the severity of food \\ninsecurity has no absolute reference against \\nwhich it could be evaluated. the rasch model \\nallows to identify the relative position that \\nthe various items occupy on a scale that is \\ndenominated in logit units, but whose ﬁzeroﬂ \\nis arbitrarily set, usually to correspond to \\nthe mean estimated severity. this implies \\nthat the zero of the scale changes in each \\napplication. to produce comparable measures \\nover time and across different populations \\nrequires establishing a common scale to use \\nas a reference, and finding the formula needed \\nto convert measures across different scales. \\nas it is the case for converting measures of \\ntemperature across difference measuring scales \\n(such as celsius and fahrenheit) this requires \\nfil,r \\n= ˜c fil,c\\n × nc˜c ncthe identification of a number of ﬁanchoringﬂ \\npoints. in the fies methodology, these anchoring \\npoints are the severity levels associated with \\nthe items whose \\nrelative \\nposition on the scale \\nof severity can be considered equal to that of \\nthe corresponding items on the global reference \\nscale. the ﬁmappingﬂ of the measures from one \\nscale to the other is then obtained by finding the \\nformula that equates the mean and the standard \\ndeviations of the common items™ severity levels.\\nchallenges and limitations:\\n when food-insecurity \\nprevalence estimates are based on fies data \\ncollected in the gwp, with national sample sizes \\nof about 1˜000˜in most countries, confidence \\nintervals rarely exceed 20˜percent of the \\nmeasured prevalence (that is, prevalence rates of \\n50˜percent would have margins of error of up to \\nplus or minus 5˜percent). confidence intervals \\nare likely to be much smaller, however, when \\nnational prevalence rates are estimated using \\nlarger samples and for estimates referring to \\naggregates of several countries.\\n to reduce the \\nimpact of year-to-year sampling variability, \\ncountry-level estimates are presented as \\nthree-year averages, computed as averages of all \\navailable years in the considered triennia.\\nresearch by a joint team from fao, ifad, wfp \\nand unicef is ongoing to further refine the \\ncurrent methodology. the team is exploring \\npossible issues related to the reference period \\nwhen questionnaires with different reference \\nperiods are used to collect data, and studying \\nrobust ways to limit the potential risk of inducing \\na bias, when adjusting country results to the \\nglobal reference scale, by further accommodating \\npossible differences in interpretation of the fies \\nitems in different languages or cultural contexts.\\nreferences:\\nfao.\\n 2016.

\\nchallenges and limitations: \\nthe recommended \\nperiodicity for countries to report on stunting, \\noverweight and wasting is every three to five \\nyears; however, for some countries data are \\navailable less frequently. while every effort has \\nbeen made to maximize the comparability of \\nstatistics across countries and over time, country \\ndata may differ in terms of data collection \\nmethods, population coverage and estimation \\nmethods used. survey estimates come with levels \\nof uncertainty due to both sampling errors and \\nnon-sampling errors (technical measurement \\nerrors, recording errors, etc.). neither of the two \\nsources of error has been fully taken into account \\nfor deriving estimates at country or regional and \\nglobal levels. \\nfor the prevalence of wasting, as surveys are \\ngenerally carried out during a specific period \\nof the year, the estimates can be affected by \\nseasonality. seasonal factors related to wasting \\ninclude food availability (e.g. preharvest periods) \\nand disease (rainy season and diarrhoea, malaria, \\netc.), while natural disasters and conflicts \\ncan also show real shifts in trends that would

[cited 10 may \\n2019].\\n˜https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/\\nlow-birthweight\\n; https://www.who.int/\\nnutgrowthdb\\nmethodology:\\n nationally representative estimates \\nof low birthweight prevalence can be derived \\nfrom a range of sources, broadly defined as \\nnational administrative data or representative \\nhousehold surveys. national administrative \\ndata are those coming from national systems \\nincluding civil registration and vital statistics \\n(crvs) systems, national health management \\ninformation systems (hmis) and birth \\nregistries.\\n national household surveys which \\ncontain information about birthweight as well \\nas key related indicators including maternal \\nperception of size at birth (mics, dhs) are also \\nan important source of low birthweight data \\nespecially in \\ncontexts where many births are \\nunweighed and/or data heaping is a problem. \\nprior to entry into the country data set, country \\ndata are reviewed for coverage and quality and \\nadjusted where the source is a household survey. \\nadministrative data are categorized as (i) high \\ncoverage, if representing ˚˜90˜percent of live \\nbirths; (ii) medium coverage, if representing \\n80œ90˜percent of live births; or (iii) not included, \\nif covering <˜80\\n˜percent of live births. to be \\nincluded in the data set, survey data need to have:\\ni.\\n a birthweight in the data set for at minimum \\n30˜percent of the sample; \\nii.\\n a minimum of 200˜birthweights in the \\ndata set; \\niii.\\n no indication of severe data heaping œ \\nthis \\nmeans that: a) ˜˚55˚percent of all birthweights \\n| 155 |can fall on the three most frequent birthweights \\n(i.e. if 3˚000˚g, 3˚500˚g and 2˚500˚g were the \\nthree most frequent birthweights, when added \\ntogether, they have to make up ˜˚55˚percent of \\nall birthweights in the data set); b) ˜˚10˚percent \\nof all birthweights ˛ 4˚500 g; c) ˜˚5˚percent of \\nbirthweights on tail ends of 500g and 5˚000˚g\\n; and \\niv.\\n undergo an adjustment for missing \\nbirthweights and heaping.\\n6 modelling methods were applied to the accepted \\n(and for household survey data, accepted and \\nadjusted) country data to generate annual \\ncountry estimates from 2000 to 2015, with \\nmethods varying by availability and type of input \\ndata as follows: \\n b-s\\npline:\\n data for countries with ˚˜8 data points \\nfrom higher coverage administrative sources \\nwith ˚˜1 prior to 2005 and ˚˜1 more point more \\nrecent than 2010 are smoothed with b-spline \\nregression to generate annual low birthweight \\nestimates. a b-spline regression model \\nwas used to predict the standard error and \\ncalculate 95˜percent confidence intervals for \\nthe country-level low birthweight estimates. \\nthese low birthweight estimates follow very \\nclosely those included in the countries™ own \\nadministrative reports.\\n hierarchical regression:\\n data for countries not \\nmeeting requirements for b-spline but with \\n˚˜1 low birthweight data point from any source \\nmeeting inclusion criteria are fitted into a \\nmodel using covariates to generate annual low \\nbirthweight estimates, as well as uncertainty \\nranges, using a bootstrap approach. the model \\nincludes natural log of neonatal mortality \\nrate; the proportion of children underweight \\n(weight-for-age z-score below minus two \\nstandard deviations from median weight \\nfor age of reference population); data type \\n(higher quality administrative, lower quality \\nadministrative, household survey); un region \\n(e.g. southern asia, caribbean); and a \\ncountry-specific random effect. these low \\nbirthweight estimates may vary substantially \\nfrom estimates reported by countries in \\nadministrative and survey reports, especially \\ngiven that the household survey estimates \\nare adjusted for missing birthweights and \\nheaping, while survey reports often present a \\nlow birthweight estimate just for the children \\nwith a birthweight and with no adjustment for \\ndata heaping.\\n no estimate:\\n countries for which low birthweight \\ninput data were not available and/or did \\nnot meet inclusion criteria are indicated in \\nthe database as ﬁno estimateﬂ. a total of 54 \\ncountries in the current country database were \\nreported as having ﬁno estimateﬂ. despite not \\npresenting an estimate for these individual \\n54 countries, annual low birthweight \\nestimates were derived for them using the \\nhierarchical regression methods detailed \\nabove but used only to input into regional and \\nglobal estimates.\\nmodelled annual country estimates are used \\nto generate regional and global estimates in \\n2000œ2015. global estimates are derived by \\nsumming the estimated number of live births \\nweighing less than 2˜500˜g for 195\\n7 countries \\nwith an estimate in the united nations regional \\ngrouping for each year and dividing by all \\nlive births in each year in those 195 countries. \\nregional estimates are similarly derived, \\nbased on countries in each regional grouping. \\nto obtain the global and regional level estimates \\nof uncertainty, 1˜000 low birthweight point \\nestimates were made for each country for each \\nyear using either b-spline (by randomly sampling \\nfrom a normal distribution plotted using the \\ncalculated standard error) or hierarchical \\nregression approach (using a bootstrap approach). \\nthe country low birthweight estimates for each \\nof the 1˜000 samples were summed at worldwide \\nor regional level and the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles \\nof the resulting distributions were used as the \\nconfidence intervals. \\nchallenges and limitations:\\n a major limitation of \\nmonitoring low birthweight globally is the lack of \\nbirthweight data for many of the world™s children. \\nthere is a notable bias among the unweighed, with \\nthose born to poorer, less educated, rural mothers \\nbeing less likely to have a birthweight when \\ncompared with their richer, urban counterparts \\nwith more highly educated mothers.\\n8 as the \\ncharacteristics of the unweighed are risk factors \\n| 156 |for having a low birthweight, estimates that do \\nnot well represent these children may be lower \\nthan the true value. furthermore, poor quality of \\navailable data with regard to excessive heaping on \\nmultiples of 500˜g or 100˜g exists in the majority \\nof available data from lmic\\n9 and can further bias \\nlow birthweight estimates. the methods applied \\nto adjust for missing birthweights and heaping \\nfor survey estimates in the current database\\n10 are \\nmeant to address the problem, however there were \\na total of 54 countries for which it was not possible \\nto generate a reliable birthweight estimate. \\nin addition, the confidence limits of the regional \\nand global estimates may be artificially small \\ngiven that about half of the modelled countries \\nhad a country-specific effect generated at random \\nfor each bootstrap prediction, some of which were \\npositive and others negative, making the relative \\nuncertainty at the regional and global level tend to \\nbe less than that at the individual country level. \\nreferences: \\na.k. blanc and t. wardlaw.\\n 2005. monitoring low \\nbirth weight: an evaluation of international \\nestimates and an

\\ndifferences in food insecurityﬂ of section 1.1.\\nb1. prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity among adults by genderfigure 14\\n is derived using data collected by \\nfao. these data are collected at individual \\nlevel. each respondent (adult œ 15 years or \\nolder) answers the fies survey module by \\nmaking reference to his/her own individual \\nfood-insecurity condition. for this reason, it \\nis possible to disaggregate the results of food \\ninsecurity by male and female respondents. to do \\nso, first, the possible presence of differential \\nitem functioning (dif) between male and \\nfemale respondents was checked, to make sure \\nthat differences between men and women in \\nfood-insecurity levels was not due to the fact \\nthat they may experience in a different way the \\nsame food-security conditions or that they may \\ninterpret the same question in a different way. \\nresults (not shown) point to no significant dif \\nbetween men and women. based on this result, \\nprevalence rates of food insecurity among men \\nand women are calculated by applying different \\nweighted raw score distributions (one for men \\nand one for women) to the same probabilities \\nof food insecurity, calculated at country level \\nbased on raw score parameters and errors \\nobtained by the application of the rasch model. \\nthis computation was performed for each year \\nof data for each country. the results shown in \\nthe graph are based on the three-year-averaged \\ncountry results in the period 2016œ2018.\\nb2. regression analysisthe text following \\nfigure 14\\n in the report describes \\nan analysis that aims at better understanding the \\ndeterminants of gender gaps in accessing food, \\nonce controlling for other factors. the analysis is \\nperformed by pooling together individual-level \\nfies data collected by fao in 145 countries, from \\n2014 to 2017, with the purpose of assessing the \\nextent of any differences in the food-insecurity \\nstatus of men and women, after controlling for \\nsocio-economic factors. a logistic regression \\nis applied using the food-insecurity status as a \\ndependent variable, established by considering \\nthe cross-country comparable probability of \\nbeing food insecure at moderate or severe level \\nfor each country. if the probability is larger than \\n50˜percent, the individual is classified as ﬁfood \\ninsecureﬂ and the dependent variable takes the \\nvalue of 1, otherwise it assumes a value of 0. \\ngender, area of residence (rural or small town \\nversus large city or suburbs), poverty status, and \\neducation level of the respondents are included as \\nindependent variables. the year of data collection \\n(between 2014 and 2017) is also included as a

dollars.\\n11 the change in country per capita \\ngrowth across two successive years is computed \\nto obtain a simple difference in growth. thus, a \\nslowdown is identified when per capita growth \\nin the current year is positive but lower in \\nmagnitude compared with the previous year. \\ndownturns are defined when the difference \\nin per capita growth between two periods is \\nnegative. furthermore, information on the \\nfrequency of economic slowdowns and downturns \\nis provided by the number of consecutive years \\nwhen a country experienced either of the two. \\nb. pou change point analysis  and methodologya change point refers to the statistically \\nsignificant change in the prevalence of \\nundernourishment over time. in this report \\nthe focus is on increasing change points, i.e. \\na statistically significant and positive increase \\nin the prevalence of undernourishment over \\ntwo consecutive years. change points in the \\npou time series were identified by applying the \\nmultiple structural changes model proposed by \\nbai and perron (1998).\\n12 this involves finding \\nthe ﬁbestﬂ combination of \\nn possible breaks \\nsubject to the constraint that distance between \\nbreak intervals should be above a minimum \\nlength. here ﬁbestﬂ means minimum sum of \\nsquared residuals from an ols regression of \\npou on a set of dummies indicating the timing \\nof the breaks. a minimum break interval of \\nthree years was imposed in the identification \\nof the optimal segmentation. pou in years \\n2005œ2018 was used to identify change points \\nbetween years 2006œ2017. an additional \\nconstraint has been used to identify the relevant \\nchange points, i.e. only those characterized by \\na subsequent increasing tendency (estimated \\nby an ordinary least squares method) for two \\nconsecutive years.\\nthe change point analysis consists in \\nidentifying increasing pou change points \\nthat correspond to the occurrence of an \\neconomic slowdown or downturn in low- and \\nmiddle-income countries. economic slowdowns \\nand downturns are identified when they occur \\nin one of the two years before the pou change \\npoint, for instance, between 2013œ2014 or \\n2014œ2015 if the pou change point occurs in \\n2015. \\nfigure \\n24 shows the number of countries \\nwith pou change points in correspondence \\nwith economic

168 |economic growth \\nand change in pou between 2011 and \\n2017a. evidence of statistical correlation between economic downturns and pou between the years 2011and 2017: model specification  and results to explore whether the recent \\nobserved increases in the prevalence of \\nundernourishment (pou) are statistically \\nassociated with economic slowdowns and \\ndownturns, an analysis was undertaken on \\nthe relationship between changes in pou and \\neconomic growth between 2011 and 2017. \\nno attempt was made to model the complex \\nmechanism and the diverse pathways by \\nwhich economic growth and hunger are \\nlinked. this would require modelling the \\ncomplex relationships between economic, \\nsocial, anthropometric and policy variables, \\nand assessing the intricate feedback routes \\nbetween them. instead, the analysis focuses \\non a reduced form of this complex system \\nand attempts to assess the correlation \\nbetween hunger and economic performance \\nœ i.e. fast rates of growth, slowdowns and \\ndownturns. the results complement those of \\nthe pou change point analysis (see \\nfigure 24\\n and annex 3) and provide evidence that the \\nrelationship between economic downturns \\nand pou between the years of 2011 and 2017 \\nis more than one of simple corresponding \\noccurrence. only economic downturns are \\nconsidered (not slowdowns) for the reasons \\nexplained below.\\nthe relationship between changes in pou and \\neconomic growth between 2011 and 2017 is \\nanalysed based on the approach of headey \\n(2013),\\n13 focusing on low- and middle-income \\ncountries. the approach involves a series of \\nordinary least squares (ols) regression \\nanalyses (\\ntable a4.2\\n) showing the correlation \\nbetween the difference in the pou and real per \\ncapita gdp growth between 2011 and 2017.\\nthe years selected for this analysis (2011 and \\n2017) correspond to the recent period in which \\nthere are notable observed increases in pou. \\nas highlighted in part˜1 of this report and \\nthe two previous editions of the report, the \\nprevalence of undernourishment and the number \\nof undernourished people in the world began \\nto increase at the aggregate world level in 2016. \\nhowever, for many countries, especially low- \\nand lower-middle-income countries, as well as \\ncountries affected by conflict and adverse climate \\nevents, undernourishment had already been on \\nthe rise as early as 2011. for this reason, the \\nstarting year of the analysis is the earliest year in \\nwhich a notable number of countries first began \\nto experience a rise in hunger, i.e. 2011, and the \\naim is to determine whether there is a statistical \\ncorrelation between the rise in pou and economic \\ngrowth during this period (2011 and 2017).\\n14however, for comparability and to test the \\nrobustness of the results, the same analysis was \\nalso carried out using the period between 2000 \\nand 2006, as well as the longer period between \\n2000 and 2017. the results show consistency in \\nthat the estimated coefficient of economic growth \\nis negative and statistically significant across \\nall three periods and specifications, although \\nthe coefficient is higher in magnitude between \\nyears 2011 and 2017, as expected. as suggested \\nby hendry (1995),\\n15 when analysing long time \\nperiods it is necessary to exclude years of \\n| 169 |annex 4\\nannex 4\\nstructural breaks in the economy in order not \\nto affect the average results. for this reason, \\nwhen doing the additional robustness checks \\nin analysing the two seven-year periods of \\n2000œ2006 and 2011œ2017, the years marked by \\nhigh volatility related to the global food price \\ncrisis and global financial crisis are omitted, \\n i.e. 2007œ2010 (see \\nfigure 22\\n and \\nbox 10\\n on the global \\nfood crisis and the global financial crisis of \\n this period).\\nthe dependent variable of the analysis is \\nspecified as the change in pou between the \\nyears 2011 and 2017. it is a continuous variable \\nhaving negative and positive values.\\n16 the pou is \\na measure of chronic undernourishment, \\n so by definition changes in pou occur slowly \\nover time. for this reason, rather than focusing \\non a year-on-year setting, this analysis measures \\ndifference in pou at two points that are far \\nenough apart to allow for a sufficient change \\nover time.\\nby definition the pou is computed and \\nsmoothed over time and there is limited \\nyear-on-year variation in estimated values. \\nin fact, pou annual point estimates are \\ncalculated as a three-year moving average \\n (for instance, pou in 2015 refers to the average \\npou for 2014œ2016, pou in 2016 refers to the \\naverage for 2015œ2017).\\n17 thus, there is a \\ntwo-year overlap in the pou yearœon-year time \\nseries, if all years are considered. instead, by \\ncomparing the change in pou between 2011 and \\n2017, there is a sufficient time lapse to identify \\nvariations. given this choice, the analysis \\nis focused on economic downturns only, \\nsince three points in time are needed to also \\ncapture economic slowdowns. an alternative \\nspecification for sensitivity analysis was also \\ntested in which only years 2011, 2013, 2015 \\nand 2017 are included, so that there is only a \\none-year overlap in the time series. this yielded \\nsimilar results to those reported below.\\n18the independent variable œ economic growth œ \\nis the percentage change in real gdp per capita \\n(constant 2010 usd prices) between 2011 and \\n2017, with the gdp deflator used to deflate \\ngrowth in per capita gdp. economic growth is \\ncomputed using real per capita gdp comparing \\ntwo points in time, 2011 and 2017, as: \\nper capita gdp\\n2011\\nper capita gdp\\n2017\\n œ per capita gdp\\n2011   \\n*100\\nreal per capita gdp are from the unstat \\nwebsite. an indicator of influence of outliers \\n(dfbetas\\n) was computed to identify outlier \\ncountries. the following countries with \\ndfbetas\\n greater than 0.17 were excluded from the \\nanalysis: angola, libya, nauru, somalia and \\ntimor-leste.\\n19an additional sensitivity analysis was carried \\nout using a logistic model with a dependent \\ndummy variable equal to 1 for pou increases \\nbetween 2011 and 2017 and equal to zero \\notherwise. the results confirm the statistical \\nsignificance of the relationship between \\nincreases in pou and changes in real per capita \\ngdp during the period analysed.\\ntables a4.1\\n and \\na4.2\\n provide the descriptive statistics \\nand econometric results, respectively.\\nconsidering the changes in pou between \\n2011 and 2017, there are number of countries \\nthat do not show an increase in pou between \\nthe two periods. as shown by the descriptive \\nstatistics (\\ntable a4.1\\n), 38 percent of the low- and \\nmiddle-income countries (49 out of 130 countries) \\nshow an increase in pou between 2011 and 2017, \\nwhereas 63 percent of the countries (81 out of \\n130) do not show an increase in pou between \\nthese two years.\\nb. evidence of statistical association between changes in pou between 2011 and 2017 and other drivers behind recent rise in prevalence of undernutrition: model specification  and results additional regression analyses were run to \\nexplore the statistical association between \\nchanges in pou between the years 2011 and 2017 \\n(dependent variable) and the three main drivers \\n| 170 |of pou: economic downturns (analysed in this \\nreport), as well as conflict and climate extremes \\n(analysed in previous report editions, 2017 and \\n2018, respectively). \\nthe specification of the dependent variable is the \\nsame as explained above. three dummy variables \\nare used as regressors to capture the effects of \\nthese three drivers: \\n economic downturns\\n: a dummy variable \\nequal to one if a country experiences negative \\neconomic growth between the years 2011 and \\n2017. economic growth is computed in the \\nsame way as explained above.\\n climate variability and extremes\\n: a dummy \\nvariable equal to one for countries with part \\nof national cereal production or yield variance \\nexplained by climate factors for the period \\n2011œ2016, as analysed and defined in the 2018 \\nedition of this report.\\n20 climate vulnerability \\nis identified for countries whose national \\ncereal production and yield variance are highly \\nand statistically significantly associated with \\ntemperature, rainfall and vegetation growth. \\na country\\'s climate vulnerability is defined \\nover the period 2011œ2016 and does not change \\nover this time.\\n conflict\\n: a dummy variable equal to one \\nif a country is affected by conflict during \\n2011œ2017, as analysed and defined in the 2017 \\nedition of this report.\\n21 in addition to this, as \\nsofi 2017 analysed conflict only up until 2015 \\nand more recent data are now available, this \\ninformation is updated for the years 2016 and \\n2017 using the uppsala conflict data program \\n(ucdp). in this analysis, countries affected by \\nconflict are defined as low- and middle-income \\ncountries and territories that have experienced \\nconflict for at least five consecutive years \\nbetween 2011œ2017, and that have suffered 500 \\nor more battle deaths during this period.\\n22table a4.3\\n below reports the econometric results. \\nfurthermore, in order to see how changes in \\npou during 2011 and 2017 vary by the level of a \\ncountry™s

country when it \\nexperiences a dependence on primary commodity \\nexport revenues, a dependence on primary \\ncommodity imports, or both. in particular, \\ncommodity-export dependence is defined as \\nthe ratio of exports of primary commodities \\n(agricultural products; minerals; ores and metals; \\nand oil) to total merchandise exports in monetary \\nterms. these export primary commodities are \\nclassified according to the standard international \\ntrade classification (sitc), that is, i.e. sitc˜0 \\n+ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 68 + 667 + 971. when a \\ncountry™s export-dependence ratio is higher

dependence is defined as the \\nratio of imports of food (sitc 0 + 1 + 22 + 4) and \\nfuels (sitc 3) to total merchandise imports in \\nmonetary terms. when a country has a share of \\nimports higher than the average, which is 0.30 for \\nlow- and middle-income countries, it is defined \\nas a high commodity-import dependent country. \\nthe data used to compute commodity dependence \\nratios are taken from unctadstat which \\nprovides yearly information on exports and \\nimports by product in thousands of usd.\\n25 the \\nanalysis in part 2 of the report is undertaken \\non low- and

usable products occurring along \\ndistribution chains from farm gate (or port of \\nimport) up to retail level.\\ndouble-duty actions\\ndouble-duty actions include interventions, \\nprogrammes and policies that have the potential \\nto simultaneously reduce the risk or burden of \\nboth undernutrition (including wasting, stunting \\n| 185 |annex 7\\nand micronutrient deficiency or insufficiency) \\nand overweight, obesity or diet-related ncds \\n(including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular \\ndisease and some cancers). double-duty actions \\nleverage the coexistence of multiple forms of \\nmalnutrition and their shared drivers to offer \\nintegrated solutions.  \\neconomic downturn\\nrefers to a period of decline in economic activity \\nor negative growth as measured by the growth \\nrate in real gdp. it is a synonym for economic \\nrecession, a temporary or short-term downturn \\nin economic growth, usually occurring over at \\nleast two consecutive quarters of decline. in the \\nanalyses and figures presented in this report, an \\neconomic downturn is identified using the year \\nas a period of reference.\\neconomic shock\\nan unexpected or unpredictable event that is \\nexternal to the specific economy and can either \\nharm or boost it. a global financial crisis causing \\nbank lending or credit to fall, or an economic \\ndownturn in a major trading partner of a country \\nreflect demand-side shocks that can have \\nmultiple effects on spending and investment. \\na steep rise in oil and gas prices, natural \\ndisasters that result in sharp falls in production, \\nor conflict that disrupts trade and production, are \\nexamples of supply-side shocks. \\neconomic slowdown \\nrefers to economic activity that is growing \\nat a slower pace compared with the previous \\nperiod. an economic slowdown occurs when \\nreal gdp growth declines from one period of \\ntime to another but it is still positive. in the \\nanalyses and figures presented in this report, an \\neconomic slowdown is identified using the year \\nas the period of reference, although it is usually \\nmeasured in quarters of a year.\\nelasticity \\nrefers to the extent to which a variable is \\nresponsive to a change in another variable (e.g. \\nincome elasticity of poverty). in the econometric \\nanalyses presented in this report it is calculated \\nas the percent change in the dependent variable \\nafter a unit change in the independent variable(s). \\nextreme poverty\\nrefers to the percentage of people living on \\nless than usd 1.90 a day (2011 ppp prices) in a \\ncountry in a given year.\\nfiscal space\\nthe budgetary room that allows a government \\nto provide resources for public purposes without \\nundermining fiscal sustainability, i.e. the ability \\nof a government to sustain its current spending, \\ntax and other policies without threatening \\ngovernment solvency or defaulting on some of \\nits liabilities. \\nfood insecurity experience scale\\nan experience-based food security scale used to \\nproduce a measure of access to food at different \\nlevels of severity that can be compared across \\ncontexts. it relies on data obtained by asking \\npeople, directly in surveys, about the occurrence \\nof conditions and behaviours that are known to \\nreflect constrained access to food. \\nfood security \\na situation that exists when all people, at all \\ntimes, have physical, social and economic access \\nto sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets \\ntheir dietary needs and food preferences for an \\nactive and healthy life. based on this definition, \\nfour food security dimensions can be identified: \\nfood availability, economic and physical access to \\nfood, food utilization, and stability over time.\\nfood security dimensions \\nrefers to the four dimensions of food security:\\na.\\n availability\\n œ this dimension addresses \\nwhether or not food is actually or potentially \\nphysically present, including aspects of \\nproduction, food reserves, markets and \\ntransportation, and wild foods.\\nb. access\\n œ if food is actually or potentially \\nphysically present, the next question is \\nwhether or not households and individuals \\nhave sufficient access to that food.\\nc.\\n utilization\\n œ if food is available and \\nhouseholds have adequate access to it, the \\nnext question is whether or not households \\nare maximizing the consumption of adequate \\nnutrition and energy. sufficient energy \\n| 186 |and nutrient intake by individuals is the \\nresult of good care and feeding practices, \\nfood preparation, dietary diversity and \\nintra-household distribution of food. \\ncombined with good biological utilization of \\nfood consumed, this determines the nutritional \\nstatus of individuals.\\nd.\\n stability\\n œ if the dimensions of availability, \\naccess and utilization are sufficiently met, \\nstability is the condition in which the whole \\nsystem is stable, thus ensuring that households \\nare food secure at all times. stability issues \\ncan refer to short-term instability (which can \\nlead to acute food insecurity) or medium- \\nto long-term instability (which can lead to \\nchronic food insecurity). climatic, economic, \\nsocial and political factors can all be a source \\nof instability.\\nfood systems\\nthe entire range of actors and their interlinked \\nvalue-adding activities involved in the \\nproduction, aggregation, processing, distribution, \\nconsumption and disposal of food products. \\nfood systems comprise all food products that \\noriginate from crop and livestock production, \\nforestry, fisheries and aquaculture, as well as \\nthe broader economic, societal and natural \\nenvironments in which these diverse production \\nsystems are embedded. \\nforeign direct investment\\nrefers to a category of investment where the \\nobjective is to establish a lasting interest by \\na resident enterprise in one economy (direct \\ninvestor) in an enterprise (direct investment \\nenterprise) that is resident in an economy \\ndifferent from the one of the direct investor. \\nit implies the existence of a long-term \\nrelationship between the direct investor and the \\ndirect investment enterprise and a significant \\ndegree of influence on the management of \\nthe enterprise.\\ngini index\\nrefers to the world bank estimate and measures \\nthe extent to which the distribution of income \\n (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) \\namong individuals or households within \\nan economy deviates from a perfectly equal \\ndistribution. it is expressed as a percentage \\nwhere 0 represents perfect equality and 100 \\nperfect inequality.\\nglobal financial crisis\\nan economic shock occurred in 2009, the \\nresult of a financial meltdown that originated \\nin developed countries. this had serious \\nimplications for the real economy and affected \\nseveral parts of the world simultaneously, \\nincluding developing countries.\\nglobal food crisis\\nan episode of a sharp increase in international \\nagricultural commodity prices between 2007 and \\nearly 2008  œ in the summer of 2008, these prices \\nreached their highest level in thirty years, before \\ndeclining in the second half of 2008. \\nhealthy diet\\na balanced, diverse and appropriate selection \\nof foods eaten over a period of time. a healthy \\ndiet ensures that the needs for macronutrients \\n(proteins, fats and carbohydrates including \\ndietary fibres) and essential micronutrients \\n(vitamins, minerals and trace elements) are met \\nspecific to the person™s gender, age, physical \\nactivity level and physiological state. for diets \\nto be healthy: 1) daily needs of energy, vitamins \\nand minerals should be met, but energy intake \\nshould not exceed needs; 2) consumption of fruit \\nand vegetables is over 400 g per day; 3) intake \\nof saturated fats is less than 10 percent of total \\nenergy intake; 4) intake of trans-fats is less \\nthan 1 percent of total energy intake; 5) intake \\nof free sugars is less than 10 percent of total \\nenergy intake or, preferably, less than 5 percent; \\n6)˜intake of salt is less than 5 grams per day. \\na healthy diet \\nfor infants and young children\\n is similar to that for adults, but the following \\nelements are also important: 1) infants should \\nbe breastfed exclusively during the first \\n6˜months of life; 2)˜infants should be breastfed \\ncontinuously until 2˜years of age and beyond; \\n3)˜from 6˜months of age, breast milk should be \\ncomplemented with a variety of adequate, safe \\nand nutrient-dense foods. salt and sugars should \\nnot be added to complementary foods.\\n| 187 |hunger\\nhunger is an uncomfortable or painful physical \\nsensation caused by insufficient consumption of \\ndietary energy. in this report, the term hunger is \\nsynonymous with chronic undernourishment.\\nmacronutrients\\nthese are the proteins, carbohydrates and \\nfats available to be used for energy; measured \\nin grams.\\nmalnutrition\\nan abnormal physiological condition caused by \\ninadequate, unbalanced or excessive consumption \\nof macronutrients and/or micronutrients. \\nmalnutrition includes undernutrition (child \\nstunting and wasting and vitamin and mineral \\ndeficiencies) as well as overweight and obesity.\\nmarginalization\\nit refers to the process of pushing particular \\ngroups of people œ usually minorities such as \\nindigenous people or rural women œ to the edge \\nof society by not allowing them to have an active \\nparticipation, identity or place in society. \\nmicronutrients\\nvitamins, minerals and other substances that are \\nrequired by the body in small amounts; measured \\nin milligrams or micrograms.\\nmoderate food insecurity\\nthe level of severity of food insecurity, based on \\nthe food insecurity experience scale, at which \\npeople face uncertainties about their ability to \\nobtain food and have been forced to reduce, \\nat times during the year, the quality and/or \\nquantity of food they consume due to lack of \\nmoney or other resources. it thus refers to a lack \\nof consistent access to food, which diminishes \\ndietary quality, disrupts normal eating patterns, \\nand can have negative consequences for nutrition, \\nhealth and well-being. \\nmultiple burden of malnutrition\\nthe coexistence of forms of undernutrition \\n(child stunting and wasting and vitamin and \\nmineral deficiencies) with overweight and obesity \\nin the same country, community, household \\nor individual.\\nnet food importers\\nrefers to countries or territories where the value \\nof imports of basic foodstuffs outweighs the value \\nof exports of basic foodstuffs. net food importers \\nexperienced a negative average food trade \\nbalance from years 2013 to 2015 (for definition, \\nsee unctad and fao. 2017),\\n31 where food refers \\nto the basic food category excluding tea, coffee, \\ncocoa and spices.\\nnutrition security\\na situation that exists when secure access to \\nan appropriately nutritious diet is coupled with \\na sanitary environment and adequate health \\nservices and care, in order to ensure a healthy \\nand active life for all household members. \\nnutrition security differs from food security in \\nthat it also considers the aspects of adequate \\ncaregiving practices, health and hygiene, in \\naddition to dietary adequacy.\\nnutrition-sensitive intervention\\nan action designed to address the underlying \\ndeterminants of nutrition (which include \\nhousehold food security, care for mothers and \\nchildren, and primary healthcare and sanitation) \\nbut not necessarily having nutrition as the \\npredominant goal.\\nnutritional status\\nthe physiological state of an individual that \\nresults from the relationship between nutrient \\nintake and requirements and the body™s ability to \\ndigest, absorb and use these nutrients.\\noverweight and obesity\\nbody weight that is above normal for height \\nas a result of an excessive accumulation of \\nfat. it is usually a manifestation of expending \\nless energy than is consumed. in adults, \\noverweight is defined as a bmi of 25˜kg/m\\n2 or \\nmore, and obesity as a bmi of 30˜kg/m\\n2 or more. \\nin children under five years of age, overweight \\nis defined as weight-for-height greater than \\n2 standard deviations above the who child \\ngrowth standards median, and obesity as \\nweight-for-height greater than 3˜standard \\ndeviations above the who child growth \\nstandards median. \\nannex 7\\n| 188 |prevalence of undernourishment\\nan estimate of the proportion of the population \\nthat lacks enough dietary energy for a healthy, \\nactive life. it is fao™s traditional indicator used \\nto monitor hunger at the global and regional \\nlevel, as well as sustainable development goal \\nindicator 2.1.1.\\nresilience \\nresilience is the ability of individuals, \\nhouseholds, communities, cities, institutions, \\nsystems and societies to prevent, resist, absorb, \\nadapt, respond and recover positively, efficiently \\nand effectively when faced with a wide range of \\nrisks, while maintaining an acceptable level of \\nfunctioning and without compromising long-term \\nprospects for sustainable development, peace and \\nsecurity, human rights and well-being for all.\\n32risk\\nthe probability or likelihood of occurrence \\nof hazardous events or trends multiplied by \\nthe impacts if these events or trends occur. \\nrisk to food insecurity is the probability of food \\ninsecurity resulting from interactions between a \\nnatural or human-induced hazard/shock/stress \\nand vulnerable conditions.\\nsevere food insecurity\\nthe level of severity of food insecurity at which \\npeople have likely run out of food, experienced \\nhunger and, at the most extreme, gone for \\ndays without eating, putting their health and \\nwell-being at grave risk, based on the food \\ninsecurity experience scale. \\nshared prosperity\\nrefers to the average annual growth in income \\nor consumption of the poorest 40 percent of the \\npopulation (the bottom 40) within each country.\\n33 it implies that if shared prosperity in a country is \\npositive, the poor are getting richer. this concept \\nis summarized by the \\nshared prosperity \\npremium \\nthat is the difference between the \\nannual income or consumption growth rate \\nof the poorest (the bottom 40) and the annual \\ngrowth rate of people at the mean of the income \\nor consumption distribution. a positive premium \\nindicates that the poorest 40 percent are getting a \\nlarger share of the overall income in the economy. \\nstructural transformation\\nstructural transformation is both a cause and \\nan effect of economic growth. it involves a \\nchange in the composition of the economy away \\nfrom a reliance on agriculture and towards \\nindustry and services, rising involvement \\nin international trade, growing ruralœurban \\nmigration and urbanization. it leads to profound \\npolitical, cultural, social and environmental \\nstresses, which must be managed for \\nlong-term sustainability.\\nstunting\\nlow height-for-age, reflecting a past episode \\nor episodes of sustained undernutrition. \\nin children under five years of age, stunting is \\ndefined height-for-age less than -2 standard \\ndeviations below the who child growth \\nstandards median.\\nterms of trade\\nrefers to the ratio between a country™s export \\nprices over its import prices. it can be interpreted \\nas the units of exports required to purchase a \\nsingle unit of import.\\nundernourishment\\nundernourishment is defined as the condition \\nin which an individual™s habitual food \\nconsumption is insufficient to provide the \\namount of dietary energy required to maintain \\na normal, active, healthy life. for the purposes \\nof this report, hunger is defined as being \\nsynonymous with chronic undernourishment.\\nundernutrition\\nthe outcome of poor nutritional intake \\nin terms of quantity and/or quality, and/\\nor poor absorption and/or poor biological \\nuse of nutrients consumed as a result of \\nrepeated instances of disease. it includes \\nbeing underweight for one™s age, too short for \\none™s age (stunted), dangerously thin for one™s \\nheight (suffering from wasting) and deficient \\nin vitamins and minerals (micronutrient \\ndeficiency).\\nvulnerability\\nthe conditions determined by physical, \\nsocial, economic and environmental factors or \\n| 189 |annex 7\\nprocesses that increase the susceptibility of \\nan individual, a community, assets or systems \\nto the impacts of hazards.\\n34 vulnerability to \\nfood insecurity is the range of conditions that \\nincreases the susceptibility of a household to \\nthe impact on food security in case of a shock \\nor hazard. \\nwasting\\nlow weight-for-height, generally the result \\nof weight loss associated with a recent period \\nof inadequate dietary energy intake and/or \\ndisease. in children under five

highlights that food insecurity is more than \\njust hunger. for the first time, the report provides evidence that many people in the world, even \\nif not hungry, experience moderate food insecurity as they face uncertainties about their ability \\nto obtain food and are forced to compromise on the quality and/or quantity of the food they \\nconsume. this phenomenon is observed globally, not only in low- and middle-income countries \\nbut also in high-income countries.\\nthe report also shows that the world is not on track to meet global nutrition targets, including \\nthose on low birthweight and on reducing stunting among children under five years. moreover, \\noverweight and obesity continue to increase in all regions, particularly among school-age \\nchildren and adults. the report stresses that no region is exempt from the epidemic of \\noverweight and obesity, underscoring the necessity of multifaceted, multisectoral approaches \\nto halt and reverse these worrying trends. \\nin light of the fragile state of the world economy, the report presents new evidence confirming \\nthat hunger has been on the rise for many countries where the economy has slowed down or \\ncontracted. unpacking the links between economic slowdowns and downturns and food \\ninsecurity and malnutrition, the report contends that the effects of the former on the latter can \\nonly be offset by addressing the root causes of hunger and malnutrition: poverty, inequality \\nand marginalization. the report concludes by recommending short- to long-term policies that \\naddress these underlying causes and safeguard food security and nutrition against economic \\nslowdowns and downturns.\\nthe state of\\n food security \\n and nutrition \\n in the worldsafeguarding against

sdg 2 œ the interrelated challenges and solutions involved in ending hunger and poverty mean that wfp will directly and indirectly contribute to most of the other \\nsdgs. wfp™s primary focus on ending hunger \\nwill serve as the entry point and rationale for \\ncontributing to sdgs other than sdg 2. 59. for example, in supporting or implementing \\nschool meals programmes, wfp might contribute to sdg 2 targets related to access to food, \\nimproved nutrition or smallholder livelihoods, \\nwhile also often making substantial contributions \\nto the achievement of other sdg targets, \\nincluding those related to education (sdg 4), \\ngender equality and women™s empowerment \\n(sdg 5), family income (sdg 1) and health (sdg \\n\\n3). in côte d™ivoire in 2016, for example, with support from the mcgovern dole programme, \\nwfp provided daily hot meals to 125,000 children \\nin 613 public primary schools in the country™s \\nmost vulnerable regions, while also fostering the \\ncapacity of women farmers to supply food for \\nthe programme. such a programme contributes \\nto the country™s national education and gender \\nequality results while also supporting health \\nresults related to dietary practices.60. in support of sdg 17, and in close consultation \\n\\nand collaboration with relevant stakeholders, \\nwfp may respond to a request from a national \\ngovernment and partners to provide services \\nthat are not directly related to zero hunger \\nefforts but that support achievement of the \\n2030 agenda goals and match wfp™s strengths \\nand capacity to assist. throughout the regional ebola crisis of 2014œ2015, for example, wfp worked in all affected countries, providing vital logistics and engineering support to the world health organization (who) and the humanitarian \\ncommunity, including storage, procurement, \\ntransport, logistics hubs in or near the capital cities, \\n\\nand 11 forward logistics bases in the three countries. \\n61. wfp™s contributions to other sdgs will be \\n\\ncaptured at the country level by linking wfp \\noutputs to the outcomes of national and other \\npartners that are related to sdg targets other \\nboundaries and context62. given the broad scope of sdg 2 and sdg 17, \\nit is important to articulate the boundaries of wfp™s engagement from a strategic perspective, and not just in response to the challenges or opportunities for involvement that may arise. \\nwfp capitalizes on its own resources, knowledge \\nand skills within a given context while respecting \\nand leveraging the added value of partners. \\n\\ntowards sdg 2 and sdg 17 in countries that the necessary functions and actions themselves, \\nor in contexts where viable, inclusive, safe and \\nreliable commercial alternatives are available \\nor other actors are better placed to contribute. \\nworking with a range of international, regional and\\n national partners, wfp aims to support countries \\n\\nresponsibility for achieving zero hunger. in countries\\n that can achieve zero hunger by 2030 without \\nassistance, wfp™s presence in the country should \\nbe phased out. for sdg 17, wfp™s support \\nto countries may relate to developmental or \\nhumanitarian objectives other than zero hunger. 63. wfp may be needed in a country in four broad \\n\\ntypes of situational context:ł disruption; ł structural poverty; \\nł transitions/recovery; and/or\\nł disaster prevention and risk mitigation.\\n these contexts often overlap. it is particularly \\nimportant to recognize that the poorest and \\nmost vulnerable people tend to face frequent disruptions that prevent sustained investments in addressing structural poverty and undermine efforts towards recovery. 37disruption\\nenough to interrupt sustainable development at \\nthe community level. examples include natural \\ndisasters, food shortages and price spikes, \\nthese disruptions lead to two types of situation where support is necessary to save lives and livelihoods: an emergency, when the initial stage after a major shock leads to a life-threatening crisis; and œ equally important œ a longer-term \\ndisruption resulting from a complex crisis such as \\n\\nimpeding the ability to invest, grow and develop, \\nleaving communities unable to cope. when host \\ncommunities and governments are forced to care for displaced populations œ sometimes for decades œ capacities are often overwhelmed, \\n\\nstructural poverty65. poverty and hunger continue to exist even when \\n\\nthere is peace, stability and the ability to invest \\nand even in countries with good overall macro \\neconomic indicators. the ﬁstructuralﬂ nature of this poverty is often related to inadequate social protection polices and systems to reach \\nall the people in need and ensure access to \\nfood. in many cases, this inability perpetuates \\nmother-and-child malnutrition, causing an \\nintergenerational cycle of hunger that is not \\nalleviated by widespread economic growth \\nand development. persistent and structural \\ngender inequalities œ particularly discriminatory institutions, norms and practices that limit opportunities for women to participate in \\neducation, health, economic and political \\n\\ndevelopment and overcoming entrenched \\npoverty and hunger; it is therefore important to \\nunderstand and shift unequal gender relations. geographical factors, lack of infrastructure and for governments to provide services in rural areas, particularly to the smallholders who constitute the majority of people living in poverty. however, as urbanization expands in \\ndeveloping countries, where the scale of poverty \\nand the rate of migration into urban areas often \\noverwhelm existing services, leaving the poorest people without access to safety nets. the effects of climate change, ecosystem degradation and \\npopulation growth amplify the challenges faced \\nfor populations in this context. strengthening \\nresilience of vulnerable households and \\ncommunities will be crucial to counter the effects \\nof these stressors. transitions/recovery66. the process of recovering from a disruption \\n\\ntypically covers the period after a major shock \\n\\npeace and the return and resettlement of displaced populations. recovery is often not \\na linear process, especially where people and \\ncommunities are very vulnerable, making it \\nlikely that setbacks will result from even minor \\nshocks and stressors. this risk underlines the \\nimportance of mainstreaming resilience-building, \\nespecially preparedness, disaster risk reduction and safety nets, in country efforts and all of wfp™s work. in communities and countries that \\ndo not face high levels of risk, rebuilding should \\nbe possible if there is sustained investment. disaster prevention and risk mitigation67. even communities that have not suffered from \\n\\nmajor disruptions or that are not affected by \\nstructural poverty can be highly vulnerable \\nand at great risk of severe disruptions such as extreme weather events due to climate \\n\\nare needed to strengthen the capacity of \\ngovernments and local stakeholders to \\nprevent and mitigate risk, especially through \\npreparedness, using integrated risk management \\napproaches.38supporting country efforts  in achieving zero hunger68. achieving zero hunger requires a common \\nunderstanding of the contexts of hunger in a \\ncountry and joint agreement on priority actions \\nto address these contexts. local contexts provide \\nthe parameters for national needs and priorities and for wfp™s strategic engagement and \\npartnerships in the country. context not only\\n determines the priorities for action, it also affects \\nchallenges that partners and people will face in \\nachieving zero hunger. all major conferences \\ncall for collaborative work to respond to local \\ncontexts, while the 2030 agenda also emphasizes \\n\\nthe importance of recognizing that some contexts \\n\\nface greater challenges than others and thus have special needs for assistance.5569. the context in each country and each situation \\nwithin a country will involve a complex mix of \\nfactors, including the political and economic \\nsituation, social and cultural practices and \\ncustoms, capacity and geography. different contexts may exist in a single country and vulnerable populations may move from one context to another over time. context-sensitive responses will require different actions within \\na single country and at different times, in line \\nwith the differing needs of women, men, girls \\nand boys and their communities. it is therefore \\nimportant that partners agree on the context and level. wfp will utilize a wide range of tools, such as vam and the three pronged approach, \\nprogrammes in close collaboration with partners.the country strategic plans approach70. the 2030 agenda will be achieved at the \\n\\ncountry level. wfp will work with national \\nstakeholders and united nations country teams \\nto determine how best to support national strategies for achieving zero hunger, making the necessary links across sectors and contexts and ensuring coherence with and support to \\ncountries™ broader strategies for sustainable \\ndevelopment. the heart of the strategic plan \\n(2017œ2021) is therefore wfp™s new country \\nstrategic planning approach, which consists of \\nstrategic reviews and country strategic plans. the objectives of the country strategic planning approach are to: i) support countries in making progress towards zero hunger; ii) operationalize the strategic plan (2017œ2021) at the country level, including effective emergency response; \\nand iii) improve strategic coherence, focus and \\noperational effectiveness to support country and \\nregional efforts in addressing food insecurity and malnutrition, while maintaining wfp™s commitment to its principles and accountability, and expecting the same from its partners.country-led strategic reviews that focus on sdg 2\\n71. wfp will participate in and, where appropriate, \\n\\nfacilitate nationally led strategic reviews of zero \\nhunger challenges and efforts. to be useful and \\nmeaningful, these country-led strategic reviews should be consultative and comprehensive, with clear and credible analysis of the humanitarian \\nand development context identifying the \\nchallenges a country faces in achieving zero \\nhunger, such as gaps in the national policy \\nframework and programmes, in the public and \\nprivate funding of the food security and nutrition \\nsector, and in the implementation capacities of government and other institutions. the strategic review should facilitate discussion of how the \\ncountry™s partners, including wfp, can support \\nthe country™s progress towards zero hunger. \\nthe strategic review and subsequent country \\nstrategic planning

also considers the food consumption score (fcs) an important indicator. wfp calculates the fcs from the frequency of consumption of \\n\\ndifferent food groups by a household during the seven days before the survey. this is an indicator of food access, based on both dietary diversity and the frequency of food groups consumed. the fcs is relevant to operations at the subnational level, which is why it is not included in the sdg indicator framework as a global indicator. however, the fcs is a proven wfp corporate indicator collected in more than 50 countries, with an operational history of more than 10 \\nyears and has enabled the organization to assess and monitor food access and consumption in developing countries. many institutions including the world bank for its computation provides a rich data repository that may be employed in a variety of ways. for example, nutrient adequacy may be analysed from the raw \\nor to prioritize dietary habits that are consistent with sustainable development goals. wfp will continue to support countries in using the fcs for monitoring food security and nutrition, particularly with respect to sdg 2.1, as appropriate, and it will continue to be a core operational indicator in the crf.47annex i11. sdg indicators 17.3:\\n\\ndevelopment assistance and southœsouth \\ncooperation as a proportion of total domestic budget; andł

of the united nations charter and the universal declaration of human rights. \\npromoting and encouraging respect for human \\nrights and international humanitarian law is a core objective of the united nations. through its mandate to address hunger, wfp is committed to ensuring that it does not exacerbate or create risks to people through its presence or assistance, but rather seeks ways of fostering \\npeople™s safety, dignity and integrity. in doing \\nso, wfp acknowledges the interlinkages between \\nrisks to people™s fundamental human rights and hunger and the potential of food assistance to support people™s safety and maintain their dignity. \\naccountability to affected populations4. wfp is accountable to affected populations, \\nboth for achieving results in addressing hunger \\nand for the manner in which programmes are \\nimplemented. this requirement calls for the systematic and meaningful engagement of people, including the most marginalized, in all \\nstages of the project cycle, to ensure that people \\nhave a voice in the decisions that affect their \\nlives. basing programmes on feedback from \\naffected communities helps to ensure that needs

of acute food insecurity\\nconˇict/insecurity was still the main driver of food crises in \\n˜˚˛˝, but weather extremes and economic shocks became \\nincreasingly signiˆcant. over half of\\ninsecure people in countries where conˇict was identiˆed as the \\nprimary driver were in the middle east and asia. regional crises \\ncontinued to see high levels of acute food insecurity, particularly \\nin the lake chad basin and central sahel. \\nafrica had the largest numbers of acutely food-insecure people in \\nneed of assistance in countries badly affected by weather events, \\nparticularly in the horn of africa and southern africa, followed by \\ncentral america and pakistan. \\nin east africa, armed conˇicts, intercommunal violence and \\nother localized tensions continued to affect peace and

having an \\nunprecedented impact around the world, both in health \\nand socioeconomic terms. by ˚˚ april, ˚.˝ million cases \\nand nearly ˚˙˙ ˙˙˙ deaths had occurred globally (who, \\n˚˚ april ˆ˙ˆ˙). \\nwhile covid-˛˝ does not discriminate, \\nterritories that are \\npeople in need of urgent humanitarian food and nutrition \\nassistance are the most vulnerable to the consequences of this \\npandemic as they have very limited or no capacity to cope with \\neither the health or socioeconomic aspects of the shock.\\nthese countries may face an excruciating trade-off between \\nsaving lives or livelihoods or, in a worst-case scenario, saving \\npeople from the corona virus to have them die from hunger. to \\nprevent these tens of millions of people already facing food crises \\nfrom succumbing to the virus or to its economic consequences, \\nall actors need to mobilize and coordinate along a set of \\noperational and strategic priorities. \\nin addition to the countries covered in the grfc ˜˚˜˚, the \\npandemic may drive up acute food insecurity levels in other \\ncountries. for instance, small island developing states (sids) \\nand oil-exporting countries may be severely affected as they are \\nnet importers of food with populations that are dependent on \\nincome from remittances and tourism.\\nthe impact on health and nutrition\\nin most of the countries covered in this report, national health \\nsystems are already over-stretched, with an alarming dearth of \\nequipment, medicines and trained staff. \\npoor people, including displaced people, often lack sufˆcient \\neconomic resources to access health care and/or live in remote \\nareas far from services. some groups are fearful of being \\nstigmatized or discriminated against in accessing public services. \\npeople in food crises often have higher rates of underlying \\nhealth conditions, including non-communicable diseases and \\nmalnutrition (acute, chronic and micronutrient deˆciencies), \\nwhich weaken the immune system and increase the risk of \\npeople developing severe covid-˛˝ symptoms. \\nrising levels of food insecurity and lack of access to healthcare œ \\neither because of movement restrictions, strained health systems \\nor falling incomes œ are likely to increase malnutrition rates, \\nparticularly among children, pregnant and lactating women and \\nthe elderly. \\nthere are also urgent concerns for the nutritional status of \\nchildren in families that rely on school feeding programmes to ˆll \\nfood gaps.the impact on food availability\\non the food supply side, harvests have been good and the ˜˚˜˚ \\noutlook for staple crops is promising. however, movement \\nrestrictions necessary to contain the spread of the virus will \\ndisrupt the transport and processing of food and other critical \\ngoods, increasing delivery times and reducing availability of \\neven the most basic food items. for households dependent on \\nfood production and livestock rearing, any disruption in the \\nsupply chain of agricultural inputs or the inability to access \\nlivestock markets, will likely lead to declines in crop and livestock \\nproduction and sales.\\nthe food security consequences of the pandemic on nomadic \\nand semi-nomadic pastoralists will likely be grave if national \\ngovernments close borders, disrupting livestock migration routes, \\nincluding across the fragile sahel region. in countries where \\ncrop and livestock production are affected by the desert locust \\noutbreak, the restrictions on movement may hinder locust control \\noperations with dramatic consequences for crop production.\\nthe impact on food access\\nrising unemployment and under-employment is likely to \\nseverely reduce people™s purchasing power. urban populations, \\nparticularly daily wage earners in the informal economies and \\nservice sector employees, are particularly at risk of losing their \\nincome sources as a result of regulations on social distancing and \\ngovernment restrictions to minimize transmission. \\nthose who are reliant on remittances to meet their basic needs \\nand those who cross borders on a regular basis to engage in \\nlivelihood activities will lose their income sources. as households \\nface reduced purchasing power, there is great potential for a \\ndecline in consumer demand œ particularly for higher value \\nproducts œ further weakening the income of producers, including \\nthose who produce high-value food products. \\npandemic alert \\nmobilizing for the impact of \\ncovid-19 in food-crisis countries\\nglobal report on food crises 2020 \\n |  5movement restrictions (and illness) are likely to limit the \\navailability of agricultural labour, which will contribute to \\nrising food prices. protectionism policies, such as tariffs and \\nexport bans, could also drive up food prices, while food crisis \\ncountries that rely heavily on food imports to cover consumption \\nrequirements, such as the democratic republic of the congo, \\nthe sudan, the syrian arab republic and yemen, will experience \\nrising food prices if their currencies depreciate further relative to \\nthe us dollar. if major importers resort to panic buying, the price \\nof globally traded food commodities could increase, particularly \\nin the short term. whether or not localized food price spikes will \\ntrickle down to remote rural markets will depend on the level \\nof integration of local markets, as well as other factors such as \\nharvest performance, seasonality, infrastructure and security.\\nsimulations developed by the organization for economic co-\\noperation and development (oecd) indicated that the expected \\n˜˚˜˚ gdp growth of ˜.˝ percent (forecast in november ˜˚˛˝) \\ncould be downgrcent if the disease spreads widely \\nacross asia-paciˆc, europe and north america. \\ngrowing fear in global markets could result in a severe decline in \\ninternational ˆnancing and portfolio outˇows from food-insecure \\ncountries. as these countries often have limited ˆscal and \\nexternal buffers, this trend would pose a signiˆcant risk to their \\ngovernments™ ability to ˆght the pandemic and maintain existing \\nsupport to vulnerable households.  \\nthe impact on displaced populations\\ndisplaced people living in camps and displaced/host populations \\nin urban areas are particularly vulnerable in overcrowded settings \\nwith poor access to adequate health care, lack of clean water, \\nhand-washing facilities and sanitation, where social distancing \\nis difˆcult, if not impossible. the legal status of refugees often \\nprevents them from being included in national social protection \\nsupport, putting them at serious risk of rising poverty levels \\ngiven their severely limited ability to access income. restrictions \\non border crossings may prevent asylum seekers from realizing \\ntheir right for protection and assistance. \\nsocial tensions and conˇictcovid-˛˝ could create the conditions for social and political \\nunrest, especially in the most vulnerable food-crisis countries. \\nuncertainty of future impacts of the pandemic combined with \\nrestrictions on movement, soaring unemployment, limited \\naccess to food, and the erosion of already fragile livelihoods may \\ngenerate discontent, fueling violence and conˇict. \\na lack of food/goods in refugee camps may increase tension \\namong refugees and host communities. perceptions that the \\nvirus is brought by non-nationals may escalate discrimination \\nand social exclusion, particularly in areas hosting displaced \\npopulations.any postponement of elections may jeopardize the democratic \\nprocess and generate tensions between ruling parties and \\noppositions. the disease could hinder international mediation \\nefforts for conˇict resolution, as well as peacekeeping operations. \\nviolence and exploitation, including sexual exploitation and \\nabuse and intimate partner violence, are likely to increase during \\nepidemic outbreaks due to increased conˆnement and exposure \\nto perpetrators, increased stress, and reduced income and access \\nto basic needs. many children who are no longer attending \\nschool during the day face increased protection risks at home.\\nimpacts on humanitarian assistance\\na major compounding factor for food-crisis countries is that \\nthe pandemic is likely to have signiˆcant repercussions on the \\ndelivery of humanitarian assistance. resources may be diverted \\nto support covid-˛˝ efforts, affecting budgets for assistance. \\nmovement restrictions are likely to affect the mobility of \\nsupplies and staff including the ability to conduct ˆeld work. \\nhumanitarian delivery costs may increase as a result.  \\npre-empting the socioeconomic impacts \\n of covid-19: priorities for action\\ngiven the unprecedented nature of the crisis, creating a better \\nunderstanding of the potential impacts of covid-˛˝

a series of analytical \\nproducts facilitated by the food security information network \\n(fsin) and produced under the initiative of the global \\nnetwork against food crises.\\nthe humanitarian-development-peace (hdp) nexus has \\nemerged as a major focus of policy debate in the years since \\nthe united nations secretary general™eport for the \\nworld humanitarian summit. the commitment to action \\nsigned at the whs called on humanitarian, development and \\nother relevant actors to work collaboratively towards collective \\noutcomes that reduce needs, risks and vulnerabilities over \\nmultiple years through a ﬁnew way of workingﬂ. \\nfunding and ˆnancing tools, instruments, policies and \\napproaches have not had time to adapt to the new hdp \\npolicy agenda proposed at the whs. moreover, practical \\nchallenges in the operationalization of the humanitarian and \\ndevelopment collaboration in links with peace are emerging. \\nin particular, stakeholders at country level report lack of \\nclarity regarding roles and rules of engagement, as well as \\nsigniˆcant divergences in principles and practices, limiting the \\nconvergence between actors along the nexus. \\nthe global network against food crises is an attempt to foster \\ngreater collaboration and cohesive action along the nexus.\\nwhat is food insecurity? \\nfood insecurity refers to the lack of secure access to sufˆcient \\namounts of safe and nutritious food for normal human growth \\nand development and an active and healthy life. for people \\nto be food secure, food must be both \\nconsistently available and accessible\\n in sufˆcient quantities and diversity and \\nhouseholds must be able to utilize (store, cook, prepare and \\nshare) the food in a way that has a positive nutritional impact.\\nacute food insecurity \\nacute food insecurity is any manifestation of food insecurity \\nat a speciˆc point in time of a severity that threatens lives, \\nlivelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or \\nduration. these acute states are highly susceptible to \\nchange and can manifest in a population within a short \\namount of time, as a result of sudden changes or shocks that \\nnegatively impact on the determinants of food insecurity \\nand malnutrition (ipc, ˜˚˛˝). transitory food insecurity is a \\nshort-term or temporary inability to meet food consumption \\nrequirements related to sporadic crises, indicating a capacity \\nto recover.\\nchronic food insecurity \\nchronic food insecurity is a long-term or persistent inability \\nto meet dietary energy requirements (lasting for a signiˆcant \\nperiod of time during the year), fao deˆnes this as \\n\\'undernourishment\\' and it is the basis for the sdg indicator \\n˜.˛.˛ published in sofi.\\npeople experiencing moderate food insecurity face \\nuncertainties about their ability to obtain food and have been \\nforced to reduce, at times during the year, the quality and/or \\nquantity of food they consume due to lack of money or other \\nresources. it thus refers to a lack of consistent access to food, \\nwhich diminishes dietary quality, disrupts normal eating

interstate conˇicts, internal violence, regional \\n or global instability, civil unrest or political crises leading to \\ndisplacements.in conˇict civilians are frequently deprived of their income \\nsources and pushed into acute food insecurity. food systems \\nand markets are disrupted, pushing up food prices and \\nsometimes leading to scarcities of water and fuel, or of food \\nitself. landmines, explosive remnants of war and improvised \\nexplosive devices often destroy agricultural land, mills, \\nstorage facilities, machinery etc. \\nconˇict prevents businesses from operating and weakens \\nthe national economy, reducing employment opportunities, \\nincreasing poverty levels and diverting government spending \\ntowards the war effort. health systems are usually damaged \\nor

access to \\nfood as a weapon of war, especially in areas under blockade/\\nembargo. food insecurity itself can become a trigger for \\nviolence and instability, particularly in contexts marked by \\npervasive inequalities and fragile institutions. sudden spikes \\nin food prices tend to exacerbate the risk of political unrest \\nand conˇict (fao et al., \\nweather extremes\\nthese include droughts, ˇoods and the untimely start of rainy \\nseasons.\\nweather-related events can directly affect crops and/or \\nlivestock, cut off roads and prevent markets from being \\nstocked. poor harvests push up food prices and diminish \\nagricultural employment opportunities, lowering income at \\na time when households are more market-reliant because of \\nreduced food stocks. \\nadverse weather events are particularly grave for smallholder \\nfarmers who cannot afford to invest in the systems and inputs \\nrequired to withstand and recover from the impacts of such \\nshocks, and for pastoralists who are vulnerable because they \\nrely on rain-fed rangeland for grazing livestock and have very \\nfew ˆxed assets. \\npeople™s vulnerability to weather shock events rests on their \\ncapacity to adapt, the scale and frequency of shocks and their \\ndependence on the affected sector. repeated events further \\nerode capacity to withstand future shocks. weather events \\nand changes in climate can often lead to an intensiˆcation of \\nconˇict between pastoralist herders and farmers over access \\nto water and grazing. there is ample evidence suggesting \\nthat natural disasters œ particularly droughts œ contribute to \\naggravating existing civil conˇicts.  \\neconomic shocks\\neconomic shocks can affect the food insecurity of households \\nor individuals through various channels. macroeconomic \\nshocks, characterized by high inˇation or hyperinˇation, \\nsigniˆcant currency depreciation, worsening terms of trade, \\nhigh unemployment rates and loss of income, a signiˆcant \\ncontraction in exports and a critical decrease in investments \\nand other capital inˇows tend to coincide with increases in \\nacute food insecurity. increases in prices of staple grains, oil or \\nagricultural inputs can affect food availability, food prices and \\nincomes. microeconomic shocks are characterized by rising \\nfood prices, lack of income sources and consequent reduction \\nin purchasing power, which directly affect households\\' food \\nsecurity.\\ncountries with weak governance and institutions, or facing \\narmed conˇict, civil unrest or

disease \\ncases in excess of normal expectancy) are usually caused by \\nan infection, transmitted through person-to-person contact, \\nanimal-to-person contact, or from the environment or other \\nmedia. water, sanitation, food and air quality are vital \\nelements in the transmission of communicable diseases and \\nin the spread of diseases prone to cause epidemics. displaced \\npopulations œ particularly in overcrowded camps œ are more \\nsusceptible to disease outbreaks which strained health \\nsystems cannot prevent or control (who). \\nepidemics and pandemics can also affect the ability of people \\nto carry on their activities and livelihoods and, in the worst \\ncases when widespread, may also affect markets and supply \\nchains.   \\ncrop pests and animal diseases \\n fall armyworms, desert \\nlocusts, etc can damage crops and may lead to severe \\nproduction shortfalls. peste des petits ruminants (ppr), foot-\\nand-mouth disease (fmd), or rift valley fever (rvf) often

\\nmajor property, infrastructure and/or environmental damage \\nas well as loss of human life.\\ndisplacementdisplacement is often a side-effect of conˇict, food insecurity \\nand weather shocks. displaced people are often more \\nvulnerable to food insecurity and malnutrition having had \\nto abandon their livelihoods and assets, undertake arduous \\njourneys and settle in areas or camps with

in different forms; it includes \\nundernutrition and overnutrition. undernutrition is more \\nthan a lack of food œ it is a combination of factors: insufˆcient \\nenergy, protein and micronutrients exacerbated by frequent \\ninfections or disease. malnutrition stunts children™s growth, \\ndeprives them of essential vitamins and minerals, and makes \\nthem more susceptible to frequent and severe disease and \\ninfections (unicef). \\nthere are also other forms of malnutrition. while not a focus of \\nthis report, it may also refer to overnutrition leading to obesity. \\nthis form of malnutrition is on the rise in almost every country \\nin the world. undernutrition and overnutrition frequently \\ncoexist within the same country, community, and even within \\nthe same individual. stunted children, for example, face a \\ngreater risk of becoming overweight as adults (unicef).\\nacute malnutritiona child being too thin for his or her height as a result of rapid \\nweight loss or the failure to gain weight is a sign of acute \\nmalnutrition (wasting) which, although treatable, can lead \\nto illness, disability or death. moderate acute malnutrition \\n(mam) using the weight for height indicator is identiˆed by \\nweight for height z scores (whz) below -˜ and above -˘ of the \\nreference population, and severe acute malnutrition (sam) \\nby whz below -˘. global acute malnutrition (gam) reˇects \\nboth mam and sam in a population. acute malnutrition can \\nalso be deˆned by mid-upper arm circumference (muac) \\nmeasur with severe acute malnutrition \\ndeˆned with a measurement of   children affected \\nrequire urgent feeding, treatment and care to survive. acute \\nmalnutrition rates depict the nutrition situation in the general \\npopulation at a speciˆc time: they can show marked seasonal \\npatterns and can change quickly over time. see table ˜.\\nchronic malnutrition\\na child being too short for his or her age (stunting) is considered \\nchronically malnourished. this condition is preventable from \\nthe ˛˙˚˚˚ days between a woman™s pregnancy and the time her \\nchild turns two. the physical and cognitive damage caused by \\nstunting can be irreversible and has far-reaching consequences, \\nfrom diminished learning and school performance to lower \\nfuture earnings, and can affect the next generation. stunted \\nchildrars old are identiˆed by a height for age \\nz score (haz) below -˜ of the reference population. severe \\nstunting is deˆned as haz below -˘. see table ˘.\\nmicronutrient de˘ciencies\\ndeˆciencies of vitamin a, iron and zinc are often referred to as \\n‚hidden\\' hunger because it develops gradually over time, and \\na large percentage of the population may be deˆcient without \\nshowing any clinical symptoms or signs of deˆciency.\\ndrivers of malnutrition in food crises \\nthe immediate cause of acute malnutrition is a severe \\nnutritional restriction either as a result of inadequate food \\nintake, or a recent bout of illness, such as diarrhoea, that \\nhinders appropriate intake and absorption of nutrients. the \\ndeterminants of malnutrition also include inadequate access \\nto healthcare, water and sanitation services, inappropriate \\nchild feeding and care practices, as described in the unicef \\nframework .\\nchildren require an adequate amount of nutrient dense \\nfoods for their optimum growth and development, to build \\nimmunity to infections and protect against disease. exclusive \\nbreastfeeding in the ˆrst six months of life followed by \\nthe timely introduction of safe and nutritionally adequate \\ncomplementary foods with continued breastfeeding until \\n˜ years of age or beyond, ensures children receive all the \\nnutrients they need. pregnant and lactating women also need \\nto consume foods from a variety of food groups, with adequate \\nand appropriate nutrients and energy to meet the increased \\nphysiological requirements, to sustain healthy fetal growth \\nand development, and support lactation. \\nduring humanitarian crises, access to nutritious foods may \\nbe limited by food shortages or disrupted food systems \\nprevalence\\n

because \\nthey may, for instance, have to take on additional agricultural \\ntasks, care for other vulnerable family members or take longer \\nto access services and water. in some contexts œ such as during \\ndisplacements œ the precarious living conditions may also \\nhinder the hygienic preparation of meals. \\ndisplaced populations often face severely compromised access \\nto safe water and improved sanitation and are at increased risk \\nof frequent outbreaks of infectious disease, which weakened \\nhealth systems cannot treat, prevent or control. measles, \\ncholera, ebola and dengue fever outbreaks are illnesses that \\nhave a negative impact on the overall health and nutritional \\nstatus of individuals, especially young children. in crises \\nchildren are often not able to access other preventive services \\nsuch as micronutrient supplementation and immunization, \\nfurther increasing the risk of malnutrition. displacement \\ncan also result in the break-down of

crises are largely context-speciˆc, there are \\nsome common vulnerabilities. \\npoverty and acute food insecurity levels are higher in \\nthe central sahel (e.g. in areas covered by l\\'autorité de \\ndéveloppement intégré du liptako-gourma [alg]) and the \\nlake chad basin border areas than they are in other parts \\nof those countries. local populations are largely engaged \\nin agriculture and pastoralism, and in the case of the lake \\nchad basin, ˆshing, and are therefore highly dependent on \\ndwindling natural resources. the increased intensity and \\nfrequency of climatic shocks œ such as recurring droughts in \\nthe central sahel œ are further degrading natural assets (e.g. \\ncropland, water resources, pastures) and generating increased \\ncompetition over those resources, thereby increasing the risk \\nof intercommunal violence, for example between pastoralist \\ngroups and farmers.\\nthe central sahel and the lake chad basin are also \\ncharacterized by a lack of presence of state systems, including \\nlimited access to basic services, the absence of security forces \\nand administrative authorities, and limited border control. \\nthese limitations are particularly applicable to pastoralist \\ncommunities, who are under-represented in local public \\ninstitutions (fao, forthcoming). \\nthe combination of these factors makes pastoral communities \\nparticularly vulnerable. on the one hand, this is due to the \\nmobile nature of their livelihoods, which constrains access \\nto basic services; on the other, the degradation of natural \\nresources not only disrupts their normal transhumance routes, \\nbut it also impoverishes their livelihoods.   \\narmed groups and transnational organized criminal gangs \\nhave also proˆted from the absence of state control, limited \\nborder control and marginalized local populations, enabling \\nthem to operate in multiple countries, disrupt regional trade, \\nor impose their rule on communities., insecurity \\nand armed groups have spread from the north and centre of \\nmali across the borders of the liptako-gourma areas into the \\nniger and burkina faso, with civilians often the victims of \\nviolence and displacement widespread, particularly in burkina \\nfaso. insecurity has also severely disrupted regional trade, \\nnotably in the sahel regions of burkina faso, mopti

and internally displaced populations \\nand placing additional pressure on the food security status of \\nboth host and displaced communities. the persistent insecurity \\nin the lake chad basin, in addition to border closures in \\nnigeria, have also affected trade in the region, contributing \\nto higher food prices and limited access to markets in certain \\nregions (rpca, ˜˚˛˝). violence has

particularly worried about the \\npotential impact on domestic food production to vulnerable \\nagropastoral populations (fao, april ˜˚˜˚). nearly a decade of \\nconˇict and terrorism in ˛˘
