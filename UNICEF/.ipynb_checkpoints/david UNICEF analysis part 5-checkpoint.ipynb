nutrition targets and monitoring lbw \\ntrends is an essential component of the global nutrition \\n\\nmonitoring framework approved by member states at the \\n\\nwha in may, 2015.\\n17 these targets are reiterated in the \\nsustainable development goals (sdgs).\\npreviously, it was estimated that there were 20·6 million \\nlbw livebirths in the year 2000;18 however, there are no \\ncontemporary standardised worldwide, regional, and \\nnational estimates or systematic trend estimates for \\nlbw, which are essential for tracking progress towards \\n\\nthe global nutrition target. the lbw prevalence and \\ntrends presented here aim to ˜ll this gap and assist in \\nsetting the baseline against which to assess progress \\ntowards the achievement of the wha targets.methodsoverview\\nour study was a systematic analysis of livebirth lbw \\ninput data from national administrative sources and \\nnationally representative surveys. we sought to identify \\nall available lbw input data for livebirths. we accessed \\n\\ndata that met preset inclusion criteria, and implemented \\ndata preprocessing steps, including adjustments to raw \\ndata where applicable, to calculate an lbw prevalence \\nfrom each datapointšie, the number of livebirths \\n(regardless of the gestational age) with a birthweight of \\n\\nless than 2500 g divided by the total number of liveborn \\nbabies who are weighed or for whom a birthweight could \\nbe imputed. finally, we estimated the lbw prevalence \\n\\nfor 195 countries for the years 2000œ15 and summed the results to obtain regional and global estimates. we report \\n\\nnational-level estimates for 148 countries with data \\nmeeting our inclusion criteria. we present our methods \\n\\nin a manner that follows the guidelines for accurate and \\n\\ntransparent health estimates reporting (gather) \\n\\nchecklist, which promotes transparency, including the \\n\\nsharing of input data and modelling code (appendix).16input datafigure 1 summarises the administrative and survey \\n\\ndata inputs and estimation methods. we considered \\n\\npopulation-based national or nationally representative \\ndatasets for inclusion if they contained information on \\nbirthweight or lbw prevalence for livebirths (appendix). \\nnationally representative estimates of lbw prevalence \\n\\ncan be derived from a range of sources, broadly de˜ned \\nas administrative data or representative household \\nsurveys. national administrative data are de˜ned as data \\n\\nfrom national systems including civil registration and \\n\\nvital statistics (crvs) systems, national health \\n\\nmanagement information systems (hmiss), and birth \\n\\nregistries. nationally representative household surveys \\n\\ninclude demographic and health surveys (dhss), \\n\\nmultiple indicator cluster surveys (micss), and other \\n\\nnational surveys.the optimal data source is a crvs system that records details on all births, including their birthweight, on a \\ncontinuous basis.19 where all newborns are weighed accurately at birth, birthweight is recorded, registration \\nis complete, and the system functions e˝ciently, the \\nresearch in context\\nevidence before this study\\nlow birthweight (lbw; <2500 g), a composite measure of fetal \\n\\ngrowth and gestational length, is an important indicator of \\n\\nmaternal and perinatal health and a predictor of adverse \\n\\nshort-term and long-term health outcomes. lbw is a key \\n\\noutcome in global nutrition targets. however, lbw data from \\n\\nadministrative data sources have not been systematically \\n\\ncollated, existing methods for adjusting survey lbw data are \\n\\nrecognised to have several limitations, and no standardised, \\n\\nsystematic estimates for lbw prevalence have been produced.\\nadded value of this study\\nthrough systematic searches (eg, of national statistical o˜ces, \\n\\nministry of health websites, and websites of the major household \\n\\nsurvey programmes of multiple indicator cluster surveys and \\n\\ndemographic and health surveys), we compiled a global lbw \\n\\ndataset (1447 datapoints from 148 countries). new methods to \\n\\nadjust survey data were developed with unicef. we estimate that \\n\\n20·5 million (uncertainty range 17·4œ24·0) livebirths had a \\n\\nbirthweight of less than 2500 g in 2015. most (91%) were in \\n\\nlow-income and middle-income countries, with nearly \\n\\nthree-quarters in sub-saharan africa and southern asia. reported \\n\\ndata from 57 mostly high-income countries with relatively low \\n\\nbaseline suggests almost no change in lbw prevalence. for the \\nremaining countries, we estimate a 17% reduction in lbw \\n\\nprevalence over the years 2000œ15, most notably in the countries \\n\\nwith the highest lbw prevalence in 2000. globally, the annual \\n\\nrate of reduction in lbw from 2000 to 2015 was 1·23%.\\nimplications of all the available evidence\\n\\ndata meeting inclusion criteria were available for three quarters \\n\\nof all un member states, with survey data remaining the \\n\\nprimary source in low-income and middle-income countries \\nand administrative data the major source in high-income \\n\\ncountries. data adhering to the inclusion criteria were not \\n\\navailable for 47 countries. closing this data gap is an important \\n\\npriority. data quality remains a concern, with evidence of \\n\\nmissing birthweights and heaping. our methods attempt to \\n\\ncorrect for heaping in survey data, but correction was not \\n\\npossible for administrative data. to increase data quality and \\n\\navailability, every newborn, whether live or stillborn, must be \\n\\nweighed, and data systems improved to capture the \\n\\nbirthweight of every newborn, including those at home or in \\n\\nprivate facilities. rates of lbw reduction worldwide will need to \\n\\nmore than double to reach the annual rate\\n of reduction of \\n2·74% required to meet the ambitious global nutrition target of \\n\\n30% reduction of lbw by 2025. action is required both to \\n\\ntackle the underlying causes of lbw and to improve the data.\\nsee online for appendixwww.thelancet.com/lancetgh \\n  vol 7   july 2019\\n e851resulting lbw prevalence will be accurate and timely. \\nhowever, existing administrative data systems might not \\n\\ncover all births, or might not collect birthweight data at \\nall. in these settings, household surveys, such as the \\nunicef-supported mics and the usaid-supported \\ndhs are important data sources for estimates of child \\nhealth, including lbw, but are recognised to have biases. \\n\\nthese data systems rely on accurate birthweight measure-ment, but despite increasing prevalence of facility births, \\nmany newborns are not weighed, and when weighed, so-\\n\\ncalled heaping at speci˜c birthweights (eg, multiples of \\n100 g or 500 g) is common. we excluded subnational or other non-population-based data such as those from \\n\\ndemographic surveillance sites and individual hospital \\ndata from the lbw data searches as they are rarely \\nnationally representative.to identify national administrative data, we searched \\nthe websites of the national statistical o˝ces (nsos) and \\nministries of health of all countries. data from years \\n2000œ16 were included. for countries with more than \\n\\none source of national administrative data available for a \\ngiven year, we gave preference to nso website data \\n\\nwhere available. where nso data were unavailable, we \\nused data obtained from the ministry of health website. \\n\\nwe used who regional databases and a unicef \\n\\ndatabase (transomnee)20 to identify countries with national administrative data not retrieved through initial \\nsearches. these data were only included if they contained \\na reference to their source or could be veri˜ed as national \\nadministrative data from the nso or ministry of health. \\n\\nwhere necessary we contacted who and unicef \\n\\nregional and country o˝ces to request further details of \\ndata sources.we obtained datasets for all dhss and micss with a \\nmidpoint of data collection of 1998 or later, and for which \\n\\nraw datasets were publicly available and contained \\n\\nbirthweight data.21œ23 a national team from the china health information and statistics center of the national \\n\\nhealth commission reanalysed data from the chinese \\n\\nnational health services surveys. if data were available \\n\\nfrom both national administrative or nationally repres\\n-entative surveys for a given country, all data meeting the \\n\\ninclusion criteria were included in the database and \\nsubsequent modelling process.where no national administrative or nationally \\nrepresentative survey data were readily available through \\nweb-based searches, we contacted unicef and who \\n\\nregional and country o˝ces in septemberœdecember, \\n\\n2014, and again in autumn 2015 and invited them to \\nprovide details of any available national lbw data.from october, 2017, to january, 2018, we did a joint \\nwhoœunicef country consultation process to enable \\neach country to provide feedback on the lbw input data \\nused, modelling methods, and preliminary estimates for \\n\\ntheir country. we received further data from 55 countries \\n\\nthrough the consultation process, resulting in 341 new or \\nupdated country-year observations.exclusions based on population representativeness at a \\nnational level\\nwe excluded national administrative data covering less \\nthan 80% of the population, or from countries with less \\n\\nthan 80% facility births in the data source year or \\n\\nless than 80% of the un estimated livebirths in a given \\n\\nyear. we also excluded survey data that were not \\n\\nnationally representative, as well as those with less than \\n\\n30% weighed at birth. we applied a lower threshold \\n\\nfor coverage of livebirths weighed to surveys (˙30%) \\n\\ncompared with administrative data sources (˙80%) \\n\\nbecause raw data are available for surveys, allowing \\n\\nmultiple imputation of missing birthweights by use of \\n\\nother covariates from the survey. this was not possible \\n\\nfor data from administrative sources.data quality assessment\\nwe identi˜ed several potential sources of bias in lbw \\n\\ndata sources (\\ntable 1). these include errors in birthweight \\n\\nmeasurement and recording (including heaping of \\nrecorded birthweights on 2500 g), misclassi˜cation \\nbetween livebirths and stillbirths, missing birthweight \\ndata, and, for administrative data, non-representativeness \\nat national level of births captured in the data sys-tem. overall, these biases are likely to result in an \\nunderestimate of lbw prevalence. we took a two-step \\n\\napproach to seek to adjust for possible biases. first, we figure ˜:\\n administrative and survey data inputs and estimation methods\\nlbw=low birthweight. *28 survey datasets were excluded on quality criteria: seven datasets were excluded because \\n\\nof extreme heaping around three values, nine because more than 10% of

\\nallowing analysis of data quality and recording errors. \\nwe excluded surveys with inadequate data quality in \\n\\nthree areas as follows. first, implausible birthweight \\n\\ndistribution de˜ned as extreme heaping whereby more \\nthan 55% of all birthweights in the dataset fall on only \\nthree values (eg, >55% of birthweights in the dataset \\n\\nwere 2500 g, 3000 g, or 3500 g); more than 10% of births \\nweighed at least 4500 g; or excessive heaping on the tail \\n\\nend of the birthweight distribution with more than 5% of \\nbirthweights at 250œ500 g and 5500 g. second, inability \\n\\nto obtain from adjustment procedures of multiple \\nimputation or ˜tting of a mixture of two normal curves, \\nor both. third, data from surveys with very low numbers \\nof livebirths weighed (<200) and hence high stochastic \\n\\nvariation.we made no further categorisation of data quality \\namong included surveys. we made adjustments to the \\n\\ndata from nationally representative household surveys by \\nuse of a revised methodology to seek to overcome the \\nlimitations of the previously used approach to address \\nmissing birthweights and heaping. we implemented \\n\\na modelling approach that comprised multiple impu-tation with individually linked variables for all surveys \\n(appendix). we replicated multiple imputations ˜ve times \\n\\nper survey and used several variables related to \\nbirthweight available in the survey datasets, including \\nmaternal factors (height, body-mass index [bmi], and \\nparity), and newborn factors (sex, singletonœmultiple \\nstatus, and perceived size at birth).to address heaping, we ˜tted a mixture of two normal distributions to each survey dataset. whereas previous \\nstudies have found that, under ideal conditions such as \\n\\nlow-risk full-term singleton livebirths included in the \\nwho child growth standards, birthweight is approxi-mately normally distributed,24 this assumption might not apply to all national populations. we tested this \\n\\nassumption in an analysis of high-quality administrative \\n\\ndata from the usa.25 fitting a single normal distribution \\nto this data from which the proportion of lbw could be \\nestimated resulted in an overestimate of the proportion \\nof livebirths with lbw compared with the raw data. this \\n\\nmight indicate that the population of all births comprises \\ntwo or more subpopulations with di˚erent distributions. \\n\\nfitting a mixture of two normal distributions resulted in \\n\\nan estimated proportion of lbw very close to that seen in \\nthe raw data. we also investigated ˜tting a mixture of \\n\\nthree normal distributions. however, this did not sub\\n-stantially improve the estimate of the proportion of lbw.\\nin summary, we estimated the proportion of lbw livebirths from each survey by the use of ˜ve steps. first, \\n\\nwe developed ˜ve datasets that had a birthweight for each \\nlivebirth (reported where available or imputed). second, \\n\\nwe ˜tted two normal distributions to the datasets. third, \\nwe calculated the lbw z score for each of the two normal \\ndistributions:fourth, we estimated the percentage of lbw (lbw[%]) \\nfor each of the two distribution curves:(ie, the percentage of the area under the curve <z2500). finally, we estimated the overall lbw prevalence by \\ncalculating the lbw(%) of the full dataset, which was a \\n\\nweighted average of the lbw(%) from both curves. the \\nweights used were based on the proportion of the \\npopulation estimated to belong to each subpopulation.since data from administrative data sources in the \\npublic domain usually only provide an aggregate number \\nlikely e˜ect on lbw \\nprevalence estimates*coverage of weighing: bias in newborns weighed at birth\\nmany newborns in lmics are not weighed at birth, especially if born at home. these \\nare more likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged and at higher risk of lbw.\\n˚extremely preterm or sick babies, those stillborn or dying soon after birth and \\n\\nthose born around threshold of viability are the most likely to not be weighed. \\n\\nthese babies are at high risk of being lbw.\\n˚coverage of data system: bias in newborns included in data source\\nlow coverage of administrative data systems in many lmics (eg, lower coverage of \\nbirth registration for those who die shortly after birth, missing home births, \\n\\nand births in private facilities even if weighed). births in private facilities are more \\n\\nlikely to be socioeconomically advantaged and at lower biological risk of lbw; \\n\\nhowever, high prevalence of medical interventions (eg, caesarean sections both \\n\\nindicated and elective before 37 weeks, may increase risk of lbw).\\n˚ or ˛\\nloss of

million births. in \\naddition to the increased data quantity, we have applied \\n\\nnew methods to adjust estimates on the basis of survey \\ndata that are more able to account for both data heaping \\nand missing data. however, an important challenge is \\n\\nthat almost half (48%) of all datapoints are from the high-\\nincome regions of north america, europe, and australia \\n\\nand new zealand, which account for 4% of the world™s \\n\\nlbw livebirths. by contrast, only 13% of data are from \\n\\nsub-saharan africa and southern asia, the regions with \\n\\nthe highest lbw prevalence, accounting for nearly \\nthree quarters of all lbw livebirths in 2015. 47 countriesš\\nthe majority (87%) low-income or middle-incomešthat \\n\\naccount for 23% of all births worldwide had no data \\nmeeting inclusion criteria. this is a classic example of \\n\\nthe inverse data lawšthe least data for the highest \\nburden settings.31 in addition, when available, these data tend to be lower quality with more heaping and other \\nchallenges, which probably lead to underestimates of \\n\\nlbw (table 1).regarding trends, no high-quality lbw trend data were \\navailable for 138 countries (91 with some lbw data \\n\\nmeeting inclusion criteria and 47 without such data), \\n\\nand we therefore predicted lbw prevalence by use of a \\n\\nstatistical model. the regions with the highest estimated \\n\\nchange in lbw prevalence (and numbers) are sub-saharan \\n\\nafrica and southern asia, where the data are most \\n\\nuncertain and the estimated trends are driven by changes \\n\\nin predictors, which might not accurately re˛ect true \\n\\nchanges in lbw prevalence over the same time period. \\n\\nhence, it is plausible that the true change in prevalence for \\n\\nlbw worldwide is lower than our estimation of 1·23%, \\n\\nand the gap to reach the target is even greater.\\nthe lbw data available from the highest burden \\nsettings are predominantly from household surveys and \\n\\nare susceptible to bias owing to missing birthweights and \\n\\nheaping. from 2004 to 2017, unicef used a simple cross \\n\\ntabulation to adjust for missing birthweight by use of data \\n\\nfrom a single variable (perceived size at birth), and a \\n\\ncrude standard adjustment for heaping that assumed that \\n\\n25% of birthweights reported as 2500 g were actually \\n\\nbelow 2500 g in every survey.\\n18,32 this previously used \\nmethod had a number of important limitations.33 hence, \\nwe used multiple imputation to impute missing birth-weights. we used several variables including perceived\\n size. we sought to address heaping throughout the \\n\\nbirthweight distribution by ˜tting a mixture of two \\n\\nnormal distributions to the observed data to obtain an \\n\\nestimate of the proportion of livebirths with a birthweight \\n\\nof less than 2500 g. although we believe our approach \\n\\nrepresents an advance on the previous method, it does \\n\\nrequire assumptionsšnamely, that missing birthweights \\n\\nare missing at random and that the true distribution of \\n\\nbirthweights in a population can be well approximated by \\n\\na mixture of two normal distributions.although we were able to adjust for heaping in the survey data for which we had individual birthweight data, \\n\\nwe were unable to do so for national administrative data \\nsources for which such data were unavailable. this might \\nlead to an underestimate of the lbw prevalence from \\nthese sources when lbw livebirths with birth weights of less than 2500 g are recorded as (heaped on) 2500 g and \\ncategorised as normal birthweight.global estimates have well recognised limitations,34 and \\ninvestments in data systems are needed to improve \\n\\nmulticountry tracking of progress towards global targets. \\n\\nlarge countries, such as india, are taking steps to improve \\n\\nthe data. however, ongoing e˚orts are required to support \\n\\ncountries in strengthening their routine reporting systems \\n\\nto decrease missing and erroneous birthweight \\n\\nmeasurements as part of their commitment to report on \\n\\nthe global nutrition monitoring framework and sdgs.\\n17 improving measure ment of birthweight must occur \\nalongside improvements in recording and reporting of all birth outcomes for mothers and their newborns, whether \\n\\nlive or stillborn.35,36 challenges arising from the low quality \\nof some data are compounded by absence of clear, \\n\\ninternationally harmonised guidelines on how to assess \\n\\nlbw data quality.\\nmore than 80% of all births worldwide are now in \\nhealth facilities, yet despite this, most of the included \\n\\ndatapoints from the highest burden regions are from \\n\\nhousehold surveys, often with

action at many levels of \\n\\nthe health system (table 5). closing the gap between \\n\\nfacility births and accurate birthweight recording should \\n\\nbe feasible and would transform data availability. at the \\n\\nindividual clinical level, appropriate equipment and \\n\\ntrained sta˚ are needed in both the public and private \\n\\nsectors. weighing devices have been available since \\n\\nantiquity and routine birthweight measurement has been \\n\\nstandard practice in europe since the late 19th century; \\n\\nhowever, accurate information on birthweight is absent \\n\\nfor most births worldwide. for example, heaping has \\n\\nbeen shown to be worse when analogue scales are used \\n\\nrather than digital ones and where scales with low \\n\\nprecision are used.37,38 there is a pressing need to develop \\na˚ordable, robust, portable, and accurate weighing \\n\\ndevices for use in both facility and community settings.recording of birthweight data on health cards, which \\ncan be used as a data source at the time of the survey, \\n\\ncould substantially improve the quality of survey \\n\\nbirthweight data and reduce the need for adjustments \\n\\n(table 5).the sickest and smallest newborns are often missing \\nfrom the data systems, including those who die soon \\n\\nafter birth, or are admitted to another ward. data system \\n\\nimprovements and linkages are required to capture \\ninformation on these most vulnerable newborns.misclassi˜cation of early neonatal deaths as stillbirths \\nremains an issue. since these babies are more likely to be \\n\\nlbw, this can lead to an underestimate of lbw prevalence \\n\\nif stillbirths are excluded.39 therefore, it is important that \\nevery newborn, whether live or stillborn, is weighed at \\n\\nbirth and that core information including birthweight \\n\\nand gestational age is captured within the data system.societal and family demand for birthweight data is an \\nunderstudied issue. little is known about family and \\ncommunity perceptions and demand for birthweight \\nmeasurement, including cultural barriers to birthweight \\nmeasurement, especially in some community settings, \\nand for stillbirths. innovations that increase the value \\nparents attach to birthweight data might help recall, and \\n\\nlead to improved recording on handheld health cards and \\nbirth certi˜cates.birthweight re˛ects both intrauterine fetal growth and \\nlength of gestation. assessing measures of weight for \\n\\ngestational age, for example small-for-gestational age, \\n\\nenables these two components to be distinguished. \\n\\nhowever, challenges in assessing gestational age accurately \\n\\nin many low-income and middle-income countries limit \\n\\nits use as a routine public health measure.40,41 debate has \\nfocused on the appropriateness of a single birthweight-for-\\n\\ngestational age cuto˚ for de˜ning fetal growth restriction, \\n\\nwith ethnic-speci˜c standards associated with more \\n\\naccurate prediction of neonatal mortality and morbidity.\\n42œ44 clear guidance on appropriate standards will be required \\n\\nas more data on gestational age become available at a \\n\\nnational level worldwide, enabling tracking of fetal growth.\\nreducing lbw requires a multifaceted approach.\\n46 even in the absence of accurate gestational age data at a \\n\\nnational level, an understanding of the underlying \\n\\npathways to lbw in a given setting is required to reduce \\nthe burden. for example, in southern asia around half of \\n\\nlbw newborns are phenotypically term but small-for-\\n\\ngestational age, which is driven by underlying maternal \\nundernutrition including maternal stunting.4 conversely \\npreterm birth is the major contributor to lbw in set-tings with many adolescent pregnancies or with high \\nprevalence of infection (eg, in east and southern africa) \\nor where pregnancy is highly medicalised with high \\nlevels of \\nfertility treatment and intensive obstetric \\nmanagement including high prevalence of caesarean \\n\\nsections (eg, the usa and brazil).47 improved birthweight data, coupled with high-quality data on gestational age, \\nwill be needed to target interventions appropriately and \\nto track progress. ongoing initiatives to improve crvs \\nand hmiss should be designed to ensure that this \\n\\ninformation is captured for all births.we estimate that there were 20·5 million lbw \\nlivebirths in 2015 worldwide, nearly three quarters of \\nthem in southern asia and sub-saharan africa. progress \\n\\nin reducing lbw prevalence (aarr 1·23%) is insuf-˜cient to reach the global nutrition targets, which will \\nrequire an aarr of 2·74%. accurate birthweight data \\n\\nare needed for all births to improve both individual \\nclinical care and public health action. there are large \\ndata gaps for the countries with the highest burden. in \\naddition to better birthweight data, better gestational age \\nassessment would help to identify the most appropriate \\ninterventions in a given setting. targeted action to \\n\\naddress the underlying causes of lbw (preterm birth \\nand fetal growth restriction) and improved care for those \\n\\nborn with lbw is needed to ensure that all realise their \\n\\nfull potential to survive and thrive. in the sdg era, these \\nmost vulnerable babies must not be left behind.\\ncontributorsmdo, eb, ch, reb, and jel contributed to overall co-ordination and \\n\\noverseeing of the process, and the idea was proposed by jel. \\n\\njk contributed to overall

appendix (pp 14œ15). using the same procedure, we \\nalso estimated neonatal (age 0œ27 days), post-neonatal \\n\\n(age 28œ364 days), and child (age 1œ4 years) mortality \\n\\nrates by ethnicity.\\nto assess the ethnic di˚erences in u5mr within each \\ncountry, we used a likelihood ratio test to compare a model \\n\\nincluding age of the child with another model including \\n\\nage and ethnic group. we also calculated two summary \\n\\nindices for quantifying relative and absolute inequalities \\n\\nin categorical variables.14 the magnitude of relative \\ninequalities, expressed as ratios among ethnic groups, was \\n\\nestimated using theil™s index,\\n14 which takes into account \\nthe proportion of the population in each group and the \\n\\nmortality ratios in each ethnicity relative to the national \\n\\nmean value. the index equals a value of zero when no \\n\\ninequality exists; as relative inequality increases, the value \\n\\nincreases, with no upper bound. the index is most \\n\\nin˝uenced by large ethnic groups with mortality rates that \\n\\nare substantially di˚erent from the national rate. in our \\n\\nanalyses the original index values were multiplied by 1000

among ethnic groups, were calculated with a \\n\\nbetween-group variance indicator. further details are also \\n\\nshown in the appendix (pp 16œ19). ses for both indices \\nwere estimated by resampling the observations of each \\n\\nethnicity per country 50 times (with replacement). negative \\n\\n95% ci values were truncated at zero. we have focused on \\n\\nrelative inequalities since statistical comparisons of \\n\\nmortality rates are usually expressed as ratios.we calculated the u5mr ratio and the corresponding \\n95% ci between the ethnic groups with the highest and \\n\\nlowest mortality rates in each country. we have presented \\n\\nmedian u5mr ratios with corresponding iqrs and \\n\\nranges. we used a non-parametric medians test to compare \\n\\nthe magnitude of theil™s index and between-group \\n\\nvariance for neonatal, post-neonatal, and child mortality by \\n\\nethnicity.\\nthree covariates were used in multivariable analyses. \\nmaternal education was categorised in three groups on \\n\\nthe basis of self-report: none (no formal education); \\n\\nprimary (any primary education, including completed \\n\\nprimary education); and secondary or higher (any \\n\\nsecondary education, including complete secondary). \\n\\nurban or rural residence was categorised according to \\n\\ncountry-speci˜c delimitations at the time of the survey. \\n\\nhousehold wealth indices included in the dhs and \\n\\nmics datasets were used in the analyses. these indices were derived using principal component analyses of \\n\\nhousehold assets and charac teristics of the building, \\npresence of electricity, water supply and sanitary \\n\\nfacilities, in addition to other variables associated with wealth. since relevant assets might vary between urban \\n\\nand rural households, separate principal component \\n\\nanalyses were done in each area, which were later \\ncombined into a single score using a scaling procedure \\n\\nto allow comparability between urban and rural \\n\\nhouseholds.15data analyses were done using stata (version 15.0) for descriptive analyses. estimation of mortality was done \\nusing the stata module syncmrates and the r statistical \\nsoftware (version 3.6.1) was used for adjustment for \\n\\ncovariates in a poisson regression framework (household \\n\\nwealth, women™s education, and urbanœrural residence). \\n\\nfor poisson regression, the reference category was the \\n\\nethnic group with the largest number of livebirths in the \\nsurvey sample. adjusted mortality rates were obtained by \\n\\nmultiplying the rate ratios by the mortality rate in the \\n\\nreference category. for the adjusted mortality rates, we \\n\\nassumed that ethnic di˚erentials were constant by age in \\nchildren aged younger than 5 years.all analyses accounted for the complex survey design. \\nmortality estimates for which the coe˛cient of variation \\n\\nwas greater than 15% were ˝agged to indicate lower \\n\\nprecision, consistent with cuto˚s of 10œ20% that have \\n\\nbeen used previously in the literature.16 mortality \\nestimates for ethnic groups with fewer than 200 births \\n\\nin the 10 years before the survey

countries, the gaps in mortality \\n\\nbetween ethnic groups were substantially reduced after \\n\\nadjust ment because substantial di˚erences in wealth, \\neducation, and place of residence exist between ethnic \\n\\ngroups in these countries, which could partly explain \\n\\nthe ethnic gap in mortality. in nigeria, the hausa, who \\nconstituted the largest ethnic group, were markedly \\n\\npoorer than the rest of the sample and also had the \\n\\nhighest mortality. in laos, the largest ethnic group (the \\n\\nlao people) were wealthier and had lower mortality \\n\\nthan other ethnic groups. in guatemala, the maya \\n\\nand xinca were poorer and had higher mortality than \\n\\nthe largest ethnic group (the ladinos or mestizos). in \\nindia, scheduled tribes and castes had higher mortality \\n\\nand were poorer than the reference group (other \\n\\nbackward classes).discussionto the best of our knowledge, this is the largest analysis of \\n\\nu5mr according to ethnicity to date, covering 415 ethnic \\n\\ngroups in 36 countries. our results show marked \\n\\nvariability in u5mr by ethnic group; the median mortality \\n\\nratio between the groups with the highest and lowest \\n\\nmortality rates in each country was equal to 2·7 in the \\n\\n36 countries and 3·3 in the 25 countries with signi˜cant \\n\\nheterogeneity according to the likelihood ratio test. we \\n\\nalso showed that the ethnic group with the largest number \\n\\nof births in each country was seldom the group with the \\n\\nlowest u5mr, suggesting that minoritiesšde˜ned in \\n\\nterms of population sizešwere not necessarily being \\n\\ndeprived of access to the services and resources required \\n\\nfor survival of their children. we also showed that \\n\\ndi˚erences between ethnic groups tended to increase \\n\\nwith child age at death, with greater disparities observed \\n\\nin deaths of children aged 1œ4 years than for younger \\n\\nchildren, which has also been reported from high-income \\n\\ncountries.17œ19 further research is needed to assess whether \\nethnic gaps in health intervention coverage also vary \\n\\naccording to age of the children. since neonatal and \\n\\ninfant mortality rates are higher than those for children \\n\\naged 1œ4 years, the absolute gap between ethnic groups \\n\\n(expressed as di˚erences between mortality rates) is \\n\\ngreater for deaths in the ˜rst year than deaths after the \\n\\n˜rst year of life.20the wide ranging review of indigenous health by \\nanderson and colleagues5 documented higher infant \\nmortality for indigenous children than non-indigenous \\n\\nchildren in 18 of 19 countries with data, but the authors did \\n\\nnot attempt to discriminate between di˚erent indigenous \\n\\ngroups. in 2000, brockerho˚ and hewett\\n10 analysed ethnic \\ngaps in u5mrs in 11 countries in sub-saharan africa, by \\ncomparing one or two relatively privileged groups in each \\n\\ncountry with the rest of the

disadvantages \\nfor children from scheduled castes and scheduled \\n\\ntribes,30,31 which were consistent with our unadjusted \\nresults. in south africa, we found a stepwise increase in \\n\\nu5mr from white individuals (u5mr 28 deaths per \\n1000 livebirths, 95% ci 3œ54), to coloured individuals (39, \\n\\n17œ62) to black individuals (52, 45œ60). the estimates for \\n\\nthe ˜rst two categories had wide 95% cis, and the \\n\\nsummary indices for inequality were not statistically \\n\\nsigni˜cant. however, other studies from this country \\n\\nreported wide and signi˜cant ethnic disparities.32,33the literature, which is mostly from high-income \\ncountries, suggests that adjustment for sociodemographic \\n\\nvariables when comparing health outcomes between \\n\\nethnic groups often shows that ethnic disparities are \\n\\nattenuated, but still persist.\\n34 in the comparison of \\nprivileged ethnic groups and the rest of the population in \\n\\n11 african countries,10 the authors concluded that adjust-ment for sociodemographic variables and household \\n\\ncharacteristics substantially reduced the survival advantage \\n\\nof privileged ethnic groups. in our analyses, ethnic gaps \\n\\ndid not change substantially after adjustment for maternal \\neducation, household wealth, or urbanœrural residence, \\n\\nwith a few exceptions. this suggests that other mech-anisms, including possibly discrimination a˚ecting access \\n\\nto essential services and life-saving interventions, might \\n\\naccount for the disparities observed. these di˚er ences \\ncould also partly re˝ect subnational variations in risk of \\n\\nmortality, since some ethnic groups are highly concentrated\\n in speci˜c areas. for example, in kenya, more than 95% of \\n\\nthe kalenjin women interviewed in the 2014 dhs lived in \\n\\nthe rift valley region.\\nour analyses had limitations, which include the use of self-reported ethnicity or proxy variables; these issues \\n\\nalso a˚ect other studies of ethnic disparities in health.5 the method by which di˚erent ethnic groups were \\nclassi˜ed was dependent on the agencies that developed \\nquestionnaires for each country, which might not have \\n\\nused consistent approaches. this inconsistency is \\n\\nsuggested by the wide variability in the number of ethnic \\ngroups among countries. some groups were labelled as \\n\\nother, indicating national ethnic groups that were not \\n\\nlisted separately, or as foreigners or none, indicating \\n\\nindividuals who reported that they did not belong to \\na speci˜c ethnic group, which was observed in honduras, \\n\\nindia, and liberia. we also note that inconsistencies \\n\\nmight exist between successive surveys in some \\ncountriesšeg, the nigeria 2013 dhs

groups, such as nomads or \\nindividuals living in con˝ict-ridden areas, might be \\nunder-represented in the sample. our results on the \\n\\nrelative sizes of ethnic groups are based on number of \\nbirths, rather than proportions of the population. \\n\\nfor example, in senegal, a higher number of births was \\n\\nrecorded among the poular than the wolof; although the \\n\\nwolof account for a larger proportion of the population \\n\\nthan the poular, they have lower fertility.\\n36sample size considerations require the use of \\ninformation on child deaths from the 10 years before the \\nsurvey; this is a standard approach used in strati˜ed \\n\\nanalyses of mortality based on survey data, but as a \\nconsequence the results for a subgroup re˝ect mortality \\nrates that are dated with an average reference date 5 years \\nbefore the survey took place. another limitation is the \\nfact that the dates of the surveys ranged from 2010 \\n(burkina faso) to 2016 (ethiopia), and u5mr tends to \\n\\ndecrease over time in most countries. it should also be \\nnoted that information collected on household wealth, \\nmaternal education, and income referred to the date of \\nthe interview, whereas information on child deaths was \\n\\nretrospective. one additional limitation is that the \\n\\nsurvival analysis methods used for u5mr implicitly \\nassume that ethnic di˚erentials by age are constant; \\nhowever, our age-strati˜ed analyses showed that gaps \\n\\nincreased slightly with child age at death. however, the \\n\\nobserved gaps were in the same direction for all age \\nranges, and the interpretation of results should not be \\nsubstantially a˚ected.the number of ethnic categories recorded in the national surveys might a˚ect statistical comparisons \\nbetween extreme groups and values of the summary \\nindices for inequality. countries with many ethnic \\n\\ngroups will tend to have higher values for these measures \\nthan those with few groups, and this ˜nding must be \\ntaken into account when interpreting the results. \\nthis problem a˚ects all summary measures of inequality \\n\\nfor unordered categories, not only the two measures \\nused in the present analyses.14,37 in the presentation of results, we focused on theil™s index, a measure of \\n\\nrelative inequality that is consistent with the rate ratio \\n\\napproach used in the multivariable analyses.our analyses are limited to countries with surveys since 2010 providing data both on ethnicity and birth histories. we examined surveys from more than \\n\\n100 countries, of which 36 countries had data that could \\nbe included in the present analyses. whether our results \\ncan be generalised to other lmics is debatable, but the \\nfact that most countries had signi˜cant ethnic gaps in \\nu5mr suggests that such inequalities might also a˚ect \\nother countries.the purpose of our analyses was to present a broad \\npicture of ethnic inequalities in child survival on the \\n\\nbasis of recent national surveys. we identi˜ed wide gaps \\n\\nin most countries studied. a detailed examination of the \\n\\nnational contexts in which these inequalities exist is \\nbeyond the scope of the present analyses, but we hope \\n\\nthat our results will motivate national researchers to \\n\\nexplore these disparities and their determinants in more \\n\\ndetail. further research might include an examination \\n\\nof the drivers of inequalities in di˚erent countries, \\n\\ncomparisons between countries with contrasting \\n\\npatterns of ethnic group inequalities, and strati˜ed \\n\\nanalyses of national samples, for example restricting the \\n\\nanalyses to rural populations or poor people living in \\n\\nurban areas.studies of health inequalities bene˜t from the use of \\nmultiple strati˜cation variables to characterise \\n\\nhouseholds and individuals. wealth quintiles can be \\n\\nused to represent similar proportions of the population \\n\\nover time, and thus are useful to assess whether gaps are \\n\\nbeing reduced; however, these quintiles are not very \\n\\nuseful for targeting interventions at speci˜c groups. \\n\\ndata on geographical inequalities are useful for targeting \\n\\ninterventions, but within the boundaries of a speci˜c \\n\\nprovince or district important disparities might exist, \\n\\nwhich is observed for poor individuals living in urban \\n\\nareas within large cities. our analyses show that ethnicity \\n\\nis an important contributor to inequality in many \\nlmics. ethnicity is relatively easy to assess in surveys \\n\\nand in registration systems and might make an \\n\\nimportant contribution to targeting interventions.20 years after the publication of the seminal article by \\nbrockerho˚ and hewett\\n10 on ethnic inequalities in \\n11 african countries, it is regrettable that little action has \\n\\nresulted from their conclusion that ﬁstrong and consistent \\n\\nresults in this study support placing the notion of \\n\\nethnicity at the forefront of theories and analyses of child \\n\\nmortalityﬂ.\\n with the current sdg emphasis on ﬁleaving \\nno one behindﬂ, we strongly advocate the need for \\n\\ngreater attention to be given to recording ethnicity in \\n\\nsurveys and also in routine administrative systems \\n\\nand health information systems to enable monitoring, \\n\\nguide targeting of interventions, and evaluate the equity \\n\\nimpact of ongoing and future health interventions. the \\n\\nmagnitude of ethnic inequities documented in our \\n\\nanalyses highlights a violation of human rights that goes \\n\\nbeyond child mortality. national governments should be \\n\\nmade account\\n able for failing to \\nensure the basic right of \\nsurvival for all of their children, regardless of ethnic \\n\\na˛liation.contributorscgv, ajdb, bm, lh, and dy conceptualised the study. cb, jcc, fcw, \\n\\nand lpv did the analyses. cgv wrote the manuscript. cgv, ajdb, and \\n\\nbm

\\nand be more accountable to all our partners. \\nhowever, what remains unchanged is the centrality of solidarity and partnership in addressing issues facing children \\nand young people today. the active involvement of many stakeholders and their collective brain power is a necessary \\ningredient to tackle the complexity of the solutions required to address some of these challenging global issues.  \\nworking side by side with you, unicef has been responding to unabated crises in syria and yemen, helping families and \\nchildren forced to ˚ee across international borders in search of protection, delivering critical supplies to victims of the \\nearthquake and tsunami in indonesia, saving malnourished children in the sahel, ˜ghting the outbreak of ebola in \\n the democratic republic of congo and the return of measles in some high and middle-income countries. \\nin 2018, our joint efforts helped more than 43 million people in humanitarian settings have access to safe water, while \\n 6.9 million children accessed some form of education; 3.6 million children and adolescents accessed psychosocial \\nsupport; and 7 million children received humanitarian cash transfers. together we responded to 285 new and ongoing \\nhumanitarian situations in 90 countries. \\nwith your support unicef provided life-saving treatment and care to 4.1 million children with severe acute malnutrition \\n(sam) and enabled nearly 12 million out-of-school children to participate in education, including in humanitarian contexts. \\nwe have also launched a new unprecedented global partnership, generation unlimited, that brings together the private \\nand public sectors, civil society and young people to co-create large-scale breakthroughs to secure a better future for the \\nworld™s 1.8 billion young people. \\nall the above results were possible because you stepped forward to support us, you spoke out, you cared. \\nwe at unicef wish to express our sincere gratitude to all resource partners for what we have achieved together in 2018 \\nfor children. of special note are partners who contributed core resources to unicef. core funding is the bedrock of \\nunicef programming. it allows unicef to plan strategically, adapt more ˚exibly to country needs and pool resources \\n to deliver joint results.\\ninspired by our shared achievements as well as the global celebration of the 30th anniversary of the convention on the \\nrights of the child in 2019, we are determined to expand and strengthen our longstanding partnerships and to do more \\n to make life better for children and young people as they contend with a range of challenges.\\nnote of thanks\\ncarla haddad mardini,  directorpublic partnerships\\nnew york, may 2019\\ngary stahl,

proportion of the population with a health-care need who receive carešdoes not account for intervention quality and potentially overestimates health bene˜ts of services provided to populations. e˚ective \\ncoverage introduces the dimension of quality of care to the measurement of intervention coverage. many de˜nitions \\nand methodological approaches to measuring e˚ective coverage have been developed, resulting in confusion over de˜nition, calculation, interpretation, and monitoring of these measures. to develop a consensus on the de˜nition \\n\\nand measurement of e˚ective coverage for maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition (mncahn), \\nwho and unicef convened a group of experts, the e˚ective coverage think tank group, to make recommendations \\nfor standardising the de˜nition of e˚ective coverage, measurement approaches for e˚ective coverage, indicators of e˚ective coverage in mncahn, and to develop future e˚ective coverage research priorities. via a series of \\n\\nconsultations, the group recommended that e˚ective coverage be de˜ned as the proportion of a population in need of \\n\\na service that resulted in a positive health outcome from the service. the proposed e˚ective coverage measures and care cascade steps can be applied to further develop e˚ective coverage measures across a broad range of mncahn services. furthermore, advances in measurement of e˚ective coverage could improve monitoring e˚orts towards the \\n\\nachievement of universal health coverage.introductionuniversal health coverage is at the centre of sustainable \\n\\ndevelopment goal (sd\\ng) 3: ﬁto ensure healthy lives and \\npromote wellbeing for all, at all agesﬂ, and is described as \\nthe key driver for achieving health-related targets.1monitoring progress towards achieving universal health \\ncoverage requires metrics that capture infor mation on the \\nproportion of the population in need of care that receives \\n\\nhealth services at a su˜cient level of quality to yield the \\nintended health bene˚ts. e˛ective coverage adds the \\n\\ndimension of quality of care to the measurement of intervention coverage and aims to better capture the \\npotential health bene˚ts of an intervention.\\n2 however, \\ndespite the potential of the e˛ective coverage approach \\nto overcome some of the limitations of inter\\n vention \\ncoverage, consensus has not been reached on its de˚-\\nnition, methodological approaches for measure ment, \\nand how indicators of e˛ective coverage should be \\n\\ninterpreted to inform global monitoring and national \\nprogrammes and policies. this variability in de˚nition \\nleads to confusion as to what actions should be taken \\nto monitor and improve quality of care. due to varying \\napproaches to estimate e˛ective coverage, the data used \\n\\nto measure e˛ective coverage vary greatly from self-\\nreported population surveys, surveys with bio markers, \\nobservations, facility surveys, and routine data collected \\n\\nthrough the health management information systems. \\n\\nalthough the data used to estimate e˛ective coverage \\noften depend on the concept being measured (e\\ng, content \\nof visit, readiness of health-care facility to provide care), \\n\\nsometimes the same concepts use di˛erent data sources. \\nstandardi sation of methods to measure e˛ective coverage \\nis urgently needed to ensure that health programmers \\n\\nand policy makers can take informed actions to improve \\n\\nquality of care for maternal, neonatal, child, and \\n\\nadolescent health and nutrition (mncahn).in 2019, who and unicef convened a group of \\nexperts, the e˛ective coverage think tank group, to \\n\\nestablish standardised de˚nitions and measurement \\n\\napproaches for e˛ective coverage, initiate discussions \\n\\non e˛ective coverage indicators for mncahn, and to \\ndevelop priorities for future research on e˛ective cover-age. the e˛ective coverage think tank series included \\nfour video tele conferences, between march and \\napril, 2019, and an in-person meeting in may, 2019\\n. participants included \\n98 experts in the ˚elds of quality-of-care measurement, monitoring and evaluation, epi\\n-demiology, and research. they were selected to be both \\n\\ngeographically diverse and include content expertise \\n\\nacross the range of mncahn components. participant \\ninputs were solicited in advance of each video tele-conference through a combination of group email \\n\\ncorrespondence and online survey tools. participation \\n\\nwas moderated through online video conferencing, \\n\\nwith a record of each call saved at its completion. the \\nin-person meeting was hosted by who and unicef \\n\\nand included a representative group of experts selected \\naccording to the same criteria described above. the \\n\\npurpose of the meeting was to synthesise the experience \\nfrom the video teleconferences and make recom-mendations for de˚ning and measuring e˛ective \\n\\ncoverage. this health policy paper summarises the \\ne731 www.thelancet.com/lancetgh   \\nvol 8   may 2020\\ndiscussion and recommendations from the e˛ective \\ncoverage

recommended that e˛ective coverage be \\nexplained using health-service coverage cascades applied \\nat the population level. cascades provide a tool for \\nassessing health-system performance across the sequence of interactions between patients and the health \\nsystem.9 the generic cascade proposed by amouzou and colleagues,4 which builds on the tanahashi framework\\n10 for evaluating health-service coverage and allows for \\npopulation-level assessment of health services along the \\nmncahn continuum of care, was supported by e˛ective coverage think tank participants for its ˝exibility to \\n\\nadapt across a range of health services. the think tank group proposed the following \\nadaptation of amouzou and colleagues™ cascade steps \\n\\n(˚gure 1) and their de˚nitions, with illustrative examples \\nfor mncahn interventions. step 1 is the target \\npopulation: identifying the population with a speci˚c \\n\\nhealth need. step 2 is service contact coverage: the \\n\\nproportion of the population in need who come into \\ncontact with the (relevant) health service. step 3 is input-adjusted coverage: the proportion of the population in \\n\\nneed who come into contact with a health service that is \\n\\nready to provide care. readiness requires that all inputs \\n\\nnecessary to provide the service are available in su˜cient \\nquantity and quality and are usable at the time of the visit. \\nthe speci˚c components will vary with the service and \\n\\nthe context in which it is provided (eg, health facility, \\n\\ncommunity, school). ste\\np 4 is intervention coverage: the \\nproportion of the population in need who come into \\n\\ncontact with a service that is ready and that receives the \\n\\nservice. step 5 is quality-adjusted coverage: the proportion \\n\\nof the population in need who come into contact with a \\n\\nservice that is ready and that receives the service according \\nto quality-of-care standards. quality-of-care standards \\nconstitute what is expected to be delivered to maximise \\n\\nthe potential positive health outcome and are commonly \\n\\nmeasured by assessing the content of the health service \\nrelative to guidelines (eg, who guidelines).11œ14 meeting \\nthese standards\\n implies that the necessary practices have \\nbeen followed while unnecessary or harmful practices \\n\\nhave been avoided (eg, unnecessary antibiotic use). \\nfurthermore, quality of care extends beyond adherence to \\n\\nguidelines to also consider whether the service was \\nprovided respectfully.\\n15 step 6 is user adherence-adjusted \\ncoverage: the proportion of the population in need who \\nreceives the service according to quality-of-care standards \\nand that adheres to provider instructions. for newborn \\nbabies and young children, this adherence includes \\n\\ncaregiver adherence to provider instructions. this step \\n\\nmight not apply to services that require no additional user \\naction after they have been delivered (\\neg, vaccination). \\nfinally, ste\\np 7 is outcome-adjusted coverage: the \\npanel ˜\\n: examples of e˜ective coverage de˚nitions and measurement

participants for \\nthe de˚nition and measurement of e˛ective coverage \\nare shown in panel 2. several considerations are \\nimportant when selecting e˛ective coverage measures \\n\\nand devel oping cascades. first, measuring e˛ective \\ncoverage through quality-adjusted or outcome-adjusted \\n\\ncoverage without reporting the additional steps of the \\nassociated cascade might be best suited for global and \\nnational monitoring because it provides an overall \\n\\nimpression of e˛ective coverage in a country. second, \\n\\nthe full cascade is most relevant for monitoring at \\n\\nsubnational and facility levels, which might need \\ndetailed information to identify bottlenecks in service \\nprovision for determining appro priate remedial actions.16 third, the level at which data are analysed should also be \\n\\nconsistent with their intended use. for example, district-\\nlevel cascades and their assessments could appropriately \\ninform decision making at the district level but might \\n\\nnot always be suitable for making targeted changes \\n\\nat each individual facility within the district. finally, \\na distinction should be made between what can be \\ncurrently measured given data availability and tech-\\nniques for linking data sources, and what could ideally \\n\\nbe measured in the future if investments are made in \\n\\nthe e˛ective coverage research agenda and in-country \\nhealth information systems.potential data sources proposed for e˜ective coverage \\nmeasureswherever possible, e˛ective coverage measures should rely on validated data. a combination of data sources \\n\\nmight be necessary to calculate indicators (eg, health facility assessments, household surveys, and routine \\nhealth management information system and admini\\n-\\nstrative data). for example, a household survey might \\n\\ncollect the epidemiological data necessary to quantify the target population (eg, incidence, prevalence) while also collecting data on care-seeking behaviours for estimating \\n\\nservice contact and receipt of services necessary for estimating intervention coverage. these data could be combined with health facility assessment results to \\nestimate input-adjusted coverage and potentially quality-\\n\\nadjusted coverage if the health facility assessment \\nincluded direct observation of services. although data on user adherence are generally more challenging to obtain, such data might be estimated according to reported data \\nfrom similar settings. finally, outcome data might be \\ncollected through disease surveillance or population-\\nbased surveys. these illustrative data sources provide an \\nexample of how cascade steps might be assessed. however, selecting ideal data sources depends on the \\nservice for which e˛ective coverage is being assessed. \\nadditional considerations regarding potential data \\n\\nsources for e˛ective coverage measures have been \\n\\npublished elsewhere.3,4,17,18applying e˜ective coverage and health-service \\ncoverage cascades to mncahn\\nthe e˛ective coverage think tank group developed \\nseveral example cascades for mncahn to show how \\ne˛ective coverage should be applied.panel ˚\\n: recommendations from the e˜ective coverage think tank group for \\nde˚nition and measures of e˜ective coverage for maternal, newborn, child, and \\n\\nadolescent health and nutritionł e˜ective coverage is de˚ned as the proportion of a population in need of a service that \\nhad a positive health outcome from the service\\nł e˜ective coverage is ideally measured as outcome-adjusted coverage in the health-\\n\\nservice coverage cascade; this type of measure is potentially feasible to produce when \\na target population needs a speci˚c health service with proven e˜ectiveness and for \\nwhich the health impact can be directly linked to the speci˚c servicešeg, children \\n\\nliving with hiv requiring antiretroviral therapy and with viral load suppression\\nł for routine preventive or promotive health services, such as counselling services, or \\n\\nantenatal and postnatal care visits during which multiple interventions are delivered, \\n\\neach of which might be linked to the same or di˜erent health outcomes, outcome-\\n\\nadjusted coverage is not an ideal e˜ective coverage measure; a more amenable measure \\nfor these health services is quality-adjusted coverage, which might be a proxy (indirect) \\nmeasurement of e˜ective coverage; quality-adjusted coverage measures can capture \\n\\ninformation on the timeliness, content, and quality of the health service provided based \\non guidelines and recommendationsł quality-adjusted coverage might also serve as a proxy for e˜ective coverage in cases \\nwhere outcome-adjusted coverage could potentially be measured but the added value \\n\\nof these data is outweighed by the resources necessary to obtain them (eg, immune \\nresponse resulting from vaccination that is complicated by challenges attributing such \\na response to vaccination rather than pathogen exposure)\\nł mortality measures are generally not a substitute for measuring e˜ective coverage for \\n\\nseveral reasonsšeg, mortality often results from a combination of factors, many of \\n\\nwhich are outside the health system and aggregated mortality cannot be used to \\nidentify where the health system has failed; we also recognise that substantial data \\ngaps exist for cause-speci˚c mortality data (eg, case fatality rates)\\nł under a few circumstances, mortality measures might be used to measure e˜ective \\n\\ncoverage when the cause of death is directly attributable to (the absence of) a speci˚c \\nhealth servicešeg, the incidence of intrapartum stillbirth (occurring during the labour \\nand childbirth period) has been used as a measure of e˜ective coverage of intrapartum \\n\\ncare; also, when the incidence and mortality of lethal conditions with known \\n\\ntreatments are tracked (eg, some cancers are monitored through cancer registries), \\nuse of mortality-to-incidence ratios might be possible (eg, to assess the health impact \\nor bene˚t of cancer screening and treatment programmes)\\nwhether e˜ective coverage is measured directly through outcome-adjusted coverage or \\n\\nindirectly through quality-adjusted coverage as a proxy, e˜ective coverage is represented \\n\\nby a single point along the cascade rather than as the entire cascade itself\\ne733 www.thelancet.com/lancetgh   \\nvol 8   may 2020\\nexample in maternal and newborn health\\nfor routine antenatal, childbirth, and postnatal care, \\nquality-adjusted coverage is the preferred measure of \\n\\ne˛ective coverage (\\n˚gure 2\\n) because of the challenge of \\nattributing maternal and neonatal mortality across these \\n\\nservices. however, for complications, outcome-adjusted \\n\\ne˛ective coverage would be an appropriate measure. \\n\\nbecause measurement of all complications is not practical, \\na tracer complication can be selectedšeg, for post-partum \\nhaemorrhage, the outcome-adjusted coverage measure of \\n\\ncontrolled post-partum bleeding could be used.example in

and measurement \\n\\nof e˛ective coverag\\ne could be developed for each \\nintervention; however, resource limitations in di˛erent \\n\\ncontexts would make tracking of e˛ective coverage of all

\\n\\nto improve the universal health coverage service coverage \\nindexšthe o˜cial measure for sdg indic\\nator 3.8.1,\\n22,23 which has been criticised for not including measures of \\ne˛ective coverage.the proposed health-service coverage cascade has four important caveats. first, the cascade does not explicitly \\n\\naccount for the range of underlying reasons for gaps that \\nmight occur between identifying the target population in the ˚rst step of the cascade and the second step that captures who sought or received needed care. these reasons can include a mixture of additional demand and \\nsupply factors.24œ26 if this gap is large, it should trigger further investigation into causal factors. second, adjust\\n-\\nment for user adherence is challenging to measure. poor \\nadherence to prescribed treatment can result in poor outcomes; however, many factors outside the health \\n\\nsystem can a˛ect adherence. third, the cascade does not \\ninclude user experience as its own component. user \\nexperience is a measure of quality of care, yet measuring it is di˜cult and prone to bias.27 finally, the cascade \\nassumes that each step must occur to have the maximum \\npositive health outcome. notable exceptions exist in \\nwhich a positive health outcome might occur in the absence of any health service (eg, recovery from illness or \\nmalnutrition in the absence of any treatment) or when \\nthe health service does not meet quality-of-care standards \\n(eg, a healthy woman and neonate after a childbirth \\nwithout a skilled birth attendant present).the e˛ective coverage think tank group identi˚ed \\nseveral research priorities. first, increased e˜ciency in \\n\\nthe use of traditional data sources is required while also considering the potential for alternative data sources. household surveys and health facility assessments \\n\\nprovide valuable data; however, these instruments are \\nadministered only every 3œ5 years, and have historically focused on women of reproductive age and children \\n\\nyounger than 5 years for health-related issues. further \\n\\nresearch is needed to determine how alternative data sources might e˛ectively be used to complement these traditional data sources. these sources might include routinely collected administrative or health management \\n\\ninformation system data, sentinel surveillance sites, or \\nthe growing body of data collected through innovative figure ˝:\\n health-service coverage cascade for hpv immunisation in girls aged 9œ14 years \\nhpv=human papillomavirus. na=not

2020\\nmobile health approaches.28 because a single data source is unlikely to provide information on all steps in the cascade, improved coordination across data collection \\napproaches and standardised methods and guidance for combining data from multiple sources are needed.29œ31second, new approaches are required to improve the \\navailability, validity, and reliability of data for measuring \\n\\neach step of the cascade. examples include being able to identify speci˚c target populations, such as preterm new-born babies requiring kangaroo mother care, because \\nnot all preterm newborn babies might be stable enough \\nto initiate care. capturing information on less tangible \\n\\ncomponents of quality of care (eg, provider norms \\nand attitudes) that a˛ect demand issues, such as an \\nindividual™s willingness to initially seek care and to stay \\nin treatment if needed (step 2 of the cascade), is also a challenge.third, research is needed to understand the linkages \\nbetween the steps in the cascade, which is especially \\nimportant when measuring quality-adjusted coverage. \\n\\nnational guidelines for service provision often include \\nseveral activities that should be done during a visit, the \\nmonitoring of which might not be feasible in resource-\\nlimited locations. de˚ning the subset of activities most \\n\\nlinked with a health outcome will minimise the additional \\n\\nreporting burden while maintaining the usefulness of the \\nmeasurement. similarly, research is needed to understand \\nand capture the resulting health e˛ects when unnecessary \\n\\nor excessive practices are performed (eg, caesarean section \\n\\nwithout indication).fourth, implementation research is needed to ensure \\nthat the e˛ective coverage frameworks proposed are \\nresponsive to the needs of decision makers and provide \\nactionable information at the global, regional, national, \\n\\nand subnational levels and to determine what tools and \\ncapacity strengthening are needed in countries to collect, analyse, and use these data.finally, testing will help to further re˚ne both e˛ective \\ncoverage indicators and cascade steps, and to assess feasibility of measurement. as much as possible, these studies should assess inequalities in e˛ective coverage by \\nstratifying by key demographic variables. these strati˚ed \\nanalyses should high light the relevance of e˛ective coverage in both low-income and high-income settings, where persistent inequities in health-service delivery remain.contributorstd, ab, and as conceived of the e˛ective

published by \\n\\nbmj.abstractintroduction the private sector accounts for an important share of health services available in south asia. it is not \\nknown to what extent socioeconomic and urbanœrural \\n\\ninequalities in maternal, newborn and child health (mnch) \\n\\ninterventions are being affected by the presence of private \\n\\nproviders.\\nmethods nationally representative surveys carried out \\nfrom 2009 to 2015 were analysed for seven of the eight \\ncountries in south asia, as data for sri lanka were not \\n\\navailable. the outcomes studied included antenatal care \\n\\n(four or more visits), institutional delivery, early initiation of \\n\\nbreast feeding, postnatal care for babies, and careseeking \\n\\nfor diarrhoea and pneumonia. results were strati˚ed \\n\\naccording to quintiles of household wealth and urbanœrural \\nresidence.\\nresults at regional level, the public sector played a larger role than the private sector in providing antenatal \\n\\n(24.8% vs 15.6% coverage), delivery (51.9% vs 26.8%) \\n\\nand postnatal care (15.7% vs 8.2%), as well as in the \\n\\nearly initiation of breast feeding (26.1% vs 11.1%). \\n\\nthe reverse was observed in careseeking for diarrhoea \\n\\n(15.0% and 46.2%) and pneumonia (18.2% and 50.5%). \\n\\nin 28 out of 37 possible analyses of coverage by country, \\n\\nsocioeconomic inequalities were signi˚cantly wider in the \\nprivate than in the public sector, and in only four cases the \\n\\nreverse pattern was observed. in 20 of the 37 analyses, \\n\\nthe public sector was also more likely to be used by the \\nwealthiest women and children.\\nconclusion\\n the private sector plays a substantial role in delivering mnch interventions in south asia but is more \\n\\ninequitable than the public sector.\\nintroductionduring the era of the millennium devel-opment goals (mdgs), much progress was achieved in terms of population coverage \\nwith key maternal, newborn and child health \\n(mnch) interventions in south asia.\\n1 between 2000 and 2015, maternal mortality \\nfell by 53% and under-five mortality by 47%.\\n2 3 however, progress at the national level does \\n\\nnot necessarily mean that within-country \\n\\ninequalities were reduced4 and, despite the clear progress, substantial challenges \\n\\nremain.5 most notably, south asia™s neonatal \\nkey questionswhat is already known? the private sector is known to play a major role in the \\ndelivery of health services in the south asia region, yet \\n\\nlittle is known regarding how it affects inequalities in \\n\\nintervention coverage for women and children.\\n earlier analyses of coverage with reproductive and \\n\\nmaternal interventions suggest that the distribution \\n\\nof services across wealth quintiles tended to be more \\n\\nequitable in the public than in the private sector. these \\n\\nanalyses did not provide formal statistical comparisons \\n\\nof the magnitude of inequalities between the two sec\\n-\\ntors, nor included the most recent surveys. none of the \\n\\nanalyses provided regionally aggregated results.\\nwhat are the new ˜ndings? our analyses of nationally representative surveys from \\n\\nseven of the eight countries in south asia con˚rm the \\n\\nimportant role played by the private sector in providing \\n\\npreventive and curative interventions to women and \\n\\nchildren in this region. our ˚ndings on socioeconomic inequalities in cover-age show that the private sector tends to be markedly \\n\\nmore unequal than the public sector throughout the \\n\\nseven countries and for all interventions under study.\\nwhat do the new ˜ndings imply? our analyses suggest that, unless proactive efforts \\n\\nare made to the contrary, greater involvement of the \\n\\nprivate sector may exacerbate inequalities in repro\\n-\\nductive, maternal, newborn and child health coverage, \\n\\nand if involvement of the private sector is deemed as \\n\\nessential for reaching the health-related sustainable \\n\\ndevelopment goals, measures must be put in place to \\n\\nmonitor and correct its potential negative impact on \\n\\nhealth inequalities. on june 18,

particularly high, and 40% of newborn deaths globally are in south asia.3 6the sustainable development goals (sdgs)7 include a comprehensive set of mnch targets that address the \\nunfinished mdg agenda, while expanding the health \\nagenda to include additional major challenges such as \\nnon-communicable diseases, injuries and the environ-\\nment. the sdg target on universal health coverage \\n(uhc) underpins all health-related targets and provides \\nan opportunity to refocus efforts toward a sustainable \\n\\napproach through system-wide reform. achieving the \\nsdg targets for mnch will represent a huge challenge \\nfor some south asian countries. the current annual rates \\nof reduction (arrs) in maternal mortality, stillbirths and \\n\\nnewborn mortality are much lower than the arrs that \\nare necessary to meet these global targets in countries \\n\\nsuch as afghanistan, bangladesh, india and pakistan6 (unicef. save newborns).\\n8there is growing recognition of the role played by the \\nprivate sector in providing mnch interventions in many \\n\\ncountries. the 2018 report of the independent account-\\nability panel for every woman, every child, every \\n\\nadolescent9 stated that ‚at this point in the roadmap to \\n2030, it is essential to get it right regarding the private \\n\\nsector™s accountability for women™s, children™s and \\n\\nadolescents™ well-being, and for public health™. this plea \\n\\nis particularly relevant for south asia, which is widely \\n\\nknown for the strong role played by the private sector in \\n\\nproviding health services. according to a recent review, \\n\\n‚healthcare services in south asia are characterised by \\n\\nlow public investment, dependence on services provided \\n\\nby the private sector, and very high rates of out of pocket \\n\\nexpenses as the principal source of health financing™.10 the same authors found that most people in south asia \\n\\ndepend on private providers for healthcare and that \\n\\npublic investment in health has stagnated. as shown in \\n\\nwho and world bank™s report in 2018, domestic private \\n\\nhealth expenditure in 2015 was very high in some south \\n\\nasian countries, corresponding to 78% of total health \\n\\nexpenditure in afghanistan, 74% in bangladesh, 71% in \\n\\nindia and in nepal and 69% in pakistan. furthermore, \\n\\namong domestic private health expenditure, more than \\n\\n90% are out-of-pocket expenditure which has exposed \\n\\nindividuals to financial hardship.11 although private \\nhealth expenditure by households is a only a proxy for \\n\\nthe size of the private sector, these figures support the \\n\\nmajor role of the private sector in the region.the public and private sectors differ in terms of geographic distribution, out-of-pocket costs to families \\nand therefore economic accessibility and likely on quality \\nof care. it is therefore likely that reliance on private or \\npublic sector will vary according to wealth and place of \\n\\nresidence. given south asia™s need to accelerate progress \\n\\non key mnch indicators, as well as existing high private \\n\\nsector expenditures, it is important to assess the current \\nrole of the private sector in advancing progress toward \\nthe equitable achievement of sdg targets for women™s \\n\\nand children™s health.\\nthe aim of the present analyses is to determine the \\nrelative importance of the private and public sectors in \\nproviding mnch care in south asian countries, with \\nparticular emphasis on their role in terms of equitable \\ncoverage. the objectives are to summarise source of care \\nfor key mnch intervention indicators in south asian \\n\\ncountries with recent data; examine socioeconomic \\nand urbanœrural inequalities of key mnch indicators, \\nwithin the public and private sectors; and to discuss the \\npolicy and programmatic implications of these findings \\nregarding the achievement of uhc for women and \\nchildren.methodsthe analyses were carried out using the most recent national survey available for seven of the eight countries in the region, as a recent survey was not available for sri \\n\\nlanka. demographic and health surveys (dhs) were \\n\\navailable for afghanistan (2015), bangladesh (2014), \\nindia (2015 national family health survey, based on \\n\\nthe dhs methodology), maldives (2009), nepal (2016) \\nand pakistan (2012). bhutan had data from a multiple \\nindicator cluster survey (mics) carried out in 2010. \\n\\nboth types of surveys use multistage sampling to identify \\n\\nwomen aged 15œ49 years and children under the age of \\n\\n5 years. their questionnaires and indicator definitions \\nare highly comparable.\\n12 further information is available \\nelsewhere on dhs13 and mics.14the following coverage indicators were selected as \\nproxies of care during the various stages of the continuum \\n\\nof mnch care: four or more antenatal care visits, place \\nof delivery (home or institution), early initiation of \\n\\nbreast feeding, postnatal care for babies, careseeking for \\nsuspected pneumonia and careseeking for diarrhoea. \\n\\npopulation coverage was expressed as the proportion \\n\\nof those in need of an intervention who received it. for \\n\\nexample, the number of births was the denominator for \\ndelivery care, and the number of children under the \\n\\nage of 5 years who presented diarrhoea in the 2 weeks \\n\\npreceding the survey was the denominator for the diar\\n-rhoea careseeking indicator. indicator definitions, with \\n\\ntheir respective denominators, are available in online \\nsupplementary webannex a.\\nfor each indicator, public and private sector contacts \\nwere differentiated. the types of facilities and providers \\ndefined as public or private in each country are shown in \\n\\nonline supplementary webannex b. in accordance with \\n\\nwho

children who used both types of providers \\nwere classified in a combined ‚public and private™ cate-\\ngory. early initiation of breast feeding was also analysed \\n\\nfor home births, in addition to the two types of providers \\ninvolved in delivering the child.coverage in the public and private sectors was strati-fied according to household wealth quintiles and urbanœ\\nrural residence. wealth indices were calculated through \\n\\nprincipal component analyses of data on household \\nappliances (such as televisions and refrigerators), char\\n-acteristics of the dwelling (materials used for the walls, \\nfloor and roof), presence of electricity, type of water \\n\\nsupply and sanitary facilities and other variables related \\n\\nto economic status (ownership of the house, land or live-\\nstock). because relevant assets may vary in urban and \\n\\nrural households, separate principal component analyses \\nare carried out in each area, which are later combined \\ninto a single score using a scaling procedure to allow \\n\\ncomparability between urban and rural households.15 the values of wealth index for each household were \\ncalculated by the survey analysts and are available in the \\n\\noriginal databases; these were used to divide the sampled \\nhouseholds into quintiles.\\n15 the classification of urban \\nor rural residence was based on criteria defined by each \\ncountry.\\ntwo summary measures of inequality, based on the \\nfrequency of the outcomes in the five wealth groups, \\nwere calculated. the slope index of inequality expresses \\n\\nabsolute inequalities, being based on a logistic regression \\napproach with coverage as the outcome and wealth as the \\nexposure.16 it is expressed as the difference in percentage points between the fitted values of the coverage indicator \\nfor the top and the bottom of the wealth distribution. \\nthe concentration index, on the other hand, reflects \\nrelative inequalities and is based on a concept similar to \\nthe gini index for income concentration; for the purpose \\nof easier presentation, we scaled both indices from ˜100 \\nto +100. both take a value of zero when there is perfect \\n\\nequality among all socioeconomic groups; positive values \\n\\nindicate higher coverage among the rich than the poor, \\n\\nand negative values indicate the opposite trend. further information on these indices and their calculation is \\navailable elsewhere.16regional estimates for south asia were obtained by weighting the national results by the country™s total \\n\\nnumber of births; for the careseeking, the weights \\nconsisted of the country™s under-five population. infor\\n-mation on births and under-five population for 2016 \\n\\nwas obtained from the unicef publication state of the \\nworld™s children.\\n17statistical tests were initially used for assessing the \\nsignificance of the associations between wealth quin\\n-\\ntiles and coverage estimates; p levels for the slope \\n\\nand concentration indices (in the online supplemen-\\ntary materials) show how far the observed distribution \\n\\nis from the line of perfect equality. the inequality \\n\\nmeasures and respective ses were obtained from our \\n\\nown reanalyses of the surveys. these were used to test \\n\\nthe differences between inequality indices in the public \\n\\nand private sectors, using z-tests based on a normal \\n\\ndistribution approximation and considering inequality \\n\\nin each group independent. the stata command ztesti was used for this purpose.all analyses are based on anonymised, publicly avail-able datasets. stata was used for all analyses (statacorp. \\n2017. stata statistical software: release 15; stata, college \\nstation, texas, usa). ethical clearance for data collec\\n-\\ntion was obtained by the national institutions responsible \\nfor the national surveys.\\npatient and public involvement statement\\nthere was no involvement of patients as the

show \\n\\nthe opposite pattern. patterns varied by country and by \\n\\nintervention. afghanistan mostly shows higher coverage \\n\\nin the public than in the private sector, particularly in \\n\\nrural areas. the reverse is true for bangladesh, where the \\nprivate sector is the most frequent source of care in both \\nareas, but particularly for urban women and children. \\nin bhutan, the private sector is virtually absent. india \\nshows a complex pattern: for careseeking, the private \\nsector predominates in both urban and rural areas; for \\nantenatal and postnatal care, urban areas had similar \\n\\nreliance on both sectors, but rural areas had greater use \\nof public sector; for delivery care and early initiation of \\n\\nbreast feeding, the public sector preference was mostly \\nmarked in rural than urban areas. in the maldives, the \\npublic sector led for most indicators, particularly in the \\nrural areas, and it also predominated in nepal, except for \\n\\nthe two careseeking indicators in urban areas. lastly, in \\n\\npakistan both urban and rural areas showed substantially \\nhigher use of the private than the public sector, for all

of private and public sector providers in delivering a limited number \\nof interventions in several countries in south asia and \\n\\nelsewhere,18œ22 but there was limited overlap with the present analyses. in particular, we update and expand on \\n\\nthe findings from a 57-country analysis of dhs carried \\n\\nout up to 2012, which included six south asian countries; \\nwe relied on more recent surveys for five of these coun\\n-\\ntries and were able to also include bhutan.23 we report \\non standardised results for seven of the eight countries in \\n\\nsouth asia, which jointly account for more than 95% of \\n\\nall children under the age of 5 years in the region. the \\nexisting literature suggests that the private sector tends \\nto be less equitable than the public sector. none of these \\n\\nearlier analyses included formal statistical comparisons \\nof the magnitude of inequalities by sector.\\nat regional level, three interventionsšinstitutional \\ndelivery and careseeking for diarrhoea and pneumoniaš\\n\\nhad coverage between 60% and 80%, whereas the other \\nthreešfour or more antenatal care visits, postnatal care \\nand early breastfeeding

than the other \\nfour, which may explain their low coverage.\\n24our analyses confirm the major role played by the private sector in delivering maternal and child health-\\ncare in the region.10 25 yet, we show that the publicœ\\nprivate mix varied substantially by country and type of \\n\\nintervention. for the region as a whole, the public sector \\n\\naccounted for most of the coverage with maternal and \\nnewborn interventions, but the private sector is respon\\n-\\nsible for most of the careseeking for childhood diarrhoea \\n\\nand pneumonia. child immunisations were not included \\nin the present analyses, but a 2011 review showed that \\nprivate sector provision accounted for a very small frac\\n-\\ntion of all vaccines provided to children in bangladesh, \\npakistan and sri lanka, and possibly a higher proportion \\n(17% in the 1990s) in india.26the analyses by wealth quintile are revealing. except for the two more recent interventionsšpostnatal care \\n\\nand early

8bmj global healthour analyses of the magnitude of inequalities by sector (table 1) show that the private sector is more inequitable than the public sector in all countries except in afghani-\\nstan and bhutan, where the private sector shows very low \\n\\ncoverage.both public and private providers contribute to inequal-ities. women and children from wealthier families tend \\n\\nto rely both on the private and public sectors, while those \\nfrom poorer families rely primarily on the public sector, \\n\\nexcept for careseeking for children.urbanœrural differences in the publicœprivate patterns \\nwere less marked than those associated with wealth. either \\n\\nprivate providers predominated both in urban and rural \\n\\nareas (as was the case for bangladesh and pakistan) or the \\n\\npublic sector led in both areas (as in afghanistan, bhutan \\n\\nand maldives). a mixed pattern was observed in india and \\n\\nnepal, where the public sector led for all interventions in \\n\\nurban and rural areas, except for careseeking for diarrhoea \\n\\nand pneumonia, where the private sector predominated; in \\n\\nnepal, this was only observed in urban areas.\\nin bangladesh, pakistan and india, the greater share of the private sector in providing child healthcare is consis-\\ntent with the findings from the literaturešnamely, that \\n\\nout-of-pocket expenditures in these countries account \\nfor more than 50% of health spending.27 it is also note-worthy that in several countries even the poorest fami-\\nlies rely mostly on the private sector, particularly for case \\n\\nmanagement of childhood illnesses.care for diarrhoea or respiratory symptoms sought \\nfrom pharmacies and drugstores was not included in \\n\\nthe present analyses, which were limited to appropriate \\nhealthcare providers as defined by dhs in conjunction \\nwith national governments, and in agreement with the \\nwho definition of appropriate care (http:// apps. who. int/ gho/ data/ node. wrapper.\\n imr? x- id= 4737). neverthe\\n-less, two of the original dhs reports provide detailed \\nbreakdowns on use of pharmacies or drugstores for pneu-\\nmonia, by wealth quintile. in bangladesh,28 the percent-ages of children taken to such shops were 27.3, 28.3, 26.8, \\n25.6 and 16.5 in wealth quintiles 1œ5, showing lesser use \\nby children from the wealthiest families. in bhutan,29 no children with pneumonia symptoms were taken to a phar-macy or drugstore in the four poorer quintiles, and only \\n0.9% of those in the wealthiest quintile sought such care. \\ntherefore, these shops may account for a substantial \\nproportion of care sought in countries such as bangla-\\ndesh, but are seldom used in others such as bhutan.our analyses have some limitations. first, there were no data for sri lanka, and for the maldives the most \\nrecent publicly available survey is from 2009 and for \\n\\npakistan from 2012; however, inequalities in coverage \\n\\ntend to change slowly, so that this is unlikely to have \\n\\nsubstantially affected the comparisons. second, the \\nclassification of private sector providers included both \\n\\nfor-profit and not-for-profit clinics, such as non-govern\\n-\\nmental organisations (ngos), of which latter might \\n\\nwell be more equitable. given that ngos accounted for \\nless than 10% of private contacts (except for antenatal, delivery and postnatal care in bangladesh), it was not \\n\\npossible to further investigate this possibility. third, the \\n\\ninformation on coverage is obtained by recall, usually \\nby the women who were interviewed about their preg\\n-\\nnancies and their children. fourth, we used household \\nasset indices for estimating socioeconomic position; such \\nindices only reflect relative position within the survey \\n\\nsample in each country, and not absolute wealth. indices \\n\\nwere calculated separately for rural and urban areas, and \\nthen merged into a national index.15 the marked differ-ences in coverage by socioeconomic position suggests \\nthat the wealth index was able to identify subgroups of \\nthe population with different access to services in each \\n\\ncountry. the regionally aggregated results must be inter\\n-preted while bearing in mind that the quintiles represent \\nwithin-country relative wealth distributions, and that the \\n\\nactual cut-offs in terms of absolute wealth may vary from \\n\\ncountry to country.\\nour analyses do not address effective coverage, that is, \\nthe adequacy and quality of the care provided during the \\n\\ncontacts with health workers. for some countries, particu-\\nlarly the maldives and nepal, sample sizes for pneumonia \\n\\ncareseeking were small due to low numbers of children \\n\\nwith this condition in the 2 weeks preceding the survey \\n\\n(see online supplementary webannex d). our popula\\n-\\ntion-weighted results are heavily influenced by the large \\n\\nindian population, yet provide a detailed overview of the \\n\\nregion as a whole; country-specific results are also provided \\n\\nin the tables and online supplementary webannexes.\\npolicy and programmatic interventions must reflect \\nthe publicœprivate mix in each country, and in particular \\n\\nthe different cadres of private providers, which were clas-\\nsified into four categories by mcpake and hanson: ‚the \\nlow-quality, underqualified sector that serves poor people \\n\\nin many countries; not-for-profit providers that operate \\n\\non a range of scales; formally registered small-to-medium \\n\\nprivate practices; and the corporate commercial hospital \\n\\nsector, which is growing rapidly and about which little is \\n\\nknown™.30 for example, in countries with strong presence \\nof the low-quality private sector, such as bangladesh, india \\n\\nand pakistan, strategies must be designed to boost the \\n\\npublic sector, which is generally more equitable as the above \\n\\nresults show. recognising that expansion of the public \\n\\nsector may require long-term investments in most coun\\n-\\ntries, immediate strategies must be put in place to promote \\n\\nthe use of appropriate private providers by poor and rural \\n\\nwomen and children, and to overcome the monetary, \\n\\ngeographic and cultural barriers that hamper their access \\n\\nto the private sector. the india™s janani suraksha yojana \\n\\nscheme of providing cash transfers to vulnerable women \\n\\nwho deliver in public or in a selected number of accredited \\n\\nprivate

increase access to providers, it is essential to invest in improving quality of care in both \\npublic and private sectors and build a responsive regula-\\ntory system; poor quality of care in low/middle-income \\n\\ncountries is pervasive and has been hampering effects \\n\\nto reduce maternal, newborn and child mortality.\\n35 the \\nhigh rates of caesarean sections in the private sector in \\ncountries such as bangladesh and india36 highlight the need for regulatory measures.\\ntraining of public and private sector practitioners may \\nalso play a role, but it may be affected by turnover and \\nby commercial interests, the latter by private providers. \\nour results on early initiation of breastfeeding coverage, \\nwhich was substantially lower than coverage with institu-\\ntional delivery, suggest the existence of missed oppor\\n-tunities that could be avoided by proper promotion. \\nhealth worker training, supportive supervision and inno\\n-\\nvative quality improvement approaches are necessary to \\n\\nensure that children brought to facilities effectively get \\nthe recommended interventions. such initiatives must be \\n\\nthoroughly evaluated not only in terms of their overall \\nimpact on coverage but also on equity.\\nlastly, there is an urgent need to focus on newborn \\nhealth, as deaths in the neonatal period are becoming \\nmore and more important in relative terms as postneo-\\nnatal deaths are being reduced at a much faster rate \\nthan newborn deaths. the leading causes of newborn \\ndeaths in the region are prematurity, intrapartum deaths \\n\\nand sepsis.37 our results included two indicators directly related to newborn healthšpostnatal visits38 and early initiation of breast feeding39šboth of which systemati-cally showed the lowest coverage in all country studies. \\n\\nto address the high mortality rate among newborns, \\n\\nunicef is currently promoting the uptake of these inter-ventions in the south asian region.8earlier analyses suggested that interventions delivered \\nat community level by the public sectoršsuch as immu-\\nnisations or vitamin a supplementationšare more equi-\\ntably distributed in the population than interventions \\n\\nthat require contact with a health provider in a hospital \\nor clinic.36 the present analyses are focused on the latter, \\nmore inequitable interventions. the main lessons arising \\n\\nlearned are that the private sector is an important source \\n\\nof care in most countries, and that access to private \\nservices is more inequitable than access to public services, \\n\\neven when for-profit and not-for-profit private services \\n\\nare jointly analysed. richer women and children are \\nmore likely to use both the private and the public sector \\nin most countries, whereas urbanœrural differences are \\nnot as marked. family wealth is a driver of inequalities, \\nand use of the private sector may be seen as a strategy \\nused by the wealthy to achieve higher coverage in light of the limited availability or perceived lack of quality of \\npublic services. yet, success in meeting uhc and the sdg \\n\\ngoals for maternal, newborn and child mortality will be \\nlargely driven by the ability to reach the poorest women \\nand children with high-quality interventions.\\nthe publicœprivate mix varies markedly by intervention, \\nfrom country to country, and according to family wealth \\n\\nand residence. effective programme and policies must be \\n\\nsupported by regular monitoring of coverage with an equity \\n\\nlens. it is also likely that for large countries such as india \\n\\nand pakistan, subnational patterns may vary, requiring \\n\\nefforts to be tailored to the local conditions.from a whole-population perspective, one may argue \\nthat the ultimate goal is to reach universal coverage and \\nthat a combination of greater use of private providers \\nby the wealthy and of public services by the poor would \\n\\nbe acceptable. our results, however, show that this is far \\n\\nfrom being the case in most south asian countries, where \\nsubstantial proportions of poor and rural women and \\nchildren are not being reached by either sector.\\nthe next step is to disseminate the present analyses \\nto policy-makers in the region and to promote data-\\ndriven, country-specific policy discussions regarding on \\n\\nhow to integrate the public and private sectors in the \\n\\neffort toward reaching high and equitable coverage.author af˜liations1unicef regional of˚ce for south asia, kathmandu,

development \\ngoals, the global strategy for women™s, chil\\n-dren™s and adolescents™ health (2016œ2030) \\n\\nrepresents an essential shift in prioritisation \\nfor actions designed to help families live \\nhealthy, secure lives and fulfil their economic \\n\\npotential.1 the reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health and \\nnutrition (rmncah-n) agenda is now both \\nbroader and more complex than was the \\ncase during the millennium development \\n\\ngoal era, creating a need for new data. to \\n\\ncontribute to this need, countdown to 2030 \\nfor women™s, children™s and adolescents™ \\n\\nhealth (countdown), a multi-institutional \\nnetwork of academics from institutions \\n\\naround the world and representatives from \\nunited nations agencies and civil society, \\n\\naims to enhance monitoring and measure-\\nment of women™s, children™s and adoles\\n-\\ncents™ health globally and in countries.2 in 2018, countdown organised a measurement \\n\\nconference in stellenbosch, south africa, \\n\\nthat brought together 100 experts in multiple \\nareas of rmncah-n, which resulted in the \\n\\nsix papers in this supplement and an overall \\nresearch agenda.the manuscripts in this collection repre-sent the first developments of countdown™s \\n\\nwork to enhance measurement. they iden-\\ntify some of the persistent measurement \\nand monitoring gaps in rmncah-n, for \\nexample, by reviewing the evidence on \\nmethods for generating effective coverage \\n\\nestimates and presenting actionable analyt\\n-\\nical methods to identify inequalities within \\nand between countries. the collection also \\nconsiders measurement advances for early \\n\\nchildhood development and for nutrition. \\nfurther, it expands to analyse new priority \\nissues, including using national surveys to \\n\\nanalyse the impact of armed conflicts on \\nrmncah-n;3 and describing the new data needed to better understand the social, polit-\\nical and contextual complexity of health \\nsystem governance.countdown will continue to extend this measurement improvement agenda. in some \\n\\naspects, however, the measurement and \\n\\nmonitoring of rmncah-n is more advanced \\nthan other health areas, such as infectious \\ndiseases, non-communicable diseases, inju-\\nries and mental health. many indicators of \\nservice contact and mortality are collected \\n\\nthrough surveys and can be disaggregated by \\n\\nmultiple dimensions of inequality. indeed, \\n\\nthe inequality component of the universal \\nhealth coverage service coverage index is \\n\\nalmost entirely based on rmncah-n indica-\\ntors.4 major gaps remain, however, in terms \\nof service quality and effective coverage, \\n\\nmaternal mortality, morbidity and causes of \\n\\ndeaths, cognitive development and multiple \\n\\nother indicators of child well-being, and \\nmultisectoral service provision.\\nbeyond the technical detail of each field, \\nthe papers in the collection broadly share two \\n\\ncommon calls for measurement. first, the \\n\\nneed for greater harmonisation of measure-\\nment standards, ideally underpinned by an \\n\\nauthority such as who, as demonstrated by \\n\\ncurrent endeavours in the field of maternal \\n\\nand newborn health, for example.5 second, \\nthe need for investment in further develop-\\nment of measurement tools and methods. \\n\\nboth are plainly justified and align well \\n\\nwith expert opinion.\\n6 consistent with \\ncountdown™s commitment to situate more \\n\\nmeasurement work in countries and to help \\n on

measurement expertise, harmonisation \\nand investment have potential to advance agendas at \\n\\nboth global and national levels. but, depending on \\n\\nperspective, there is the possibility of a tension between \\n\\nthese two sets of needs.harmonisationa common theme across the manuscripts is the \\nneed for a process to generate global consensus on \\n\\na minimum core set of validated coverage indica-\\ntors on high-impact interventions, with guidance \\n\\nfor measurement by who, and incorporated into \\n\\nrelevant measurement tools. the case is well made \\n\\nthat without this the interpretation and compara\\n-\\nbility of data across time and place would be limited, \\n\\nopportunities for learning reduced and potential for \\n\\ninfluence diminished. the review by amouzou et al demonstrates an urgent need for harmonisation of \\n\\ndefinition and methods if we are to progress quali-\\nty-adjusted coverage measurement from specialist \\n\\nstudies to standard practice.7 for early childhood \\ndevelopment, the need for a measurement framework \\n\\nand indicators to enable cross-country comparison of \\n\\nprogress and help sustain momentum is clearly made.8 and with only half of high-impact nutrition interven\\n-\\ntions being measured through large-scale surveys, it \\n\\nis evident that programmes addressing malnutrition \\n\\nneed more and standardised data.9gillespie et al also make the important point about \\nthe possible tension between harmonisation of indica-\\ntors for global measurement and the indicator defini-\\ntion that speaks to a specific country programme. when \\n\\nmeasurement is driven by country priorities, the ideal \\n\\nindicators for programme management will depend on \\n\\nthe intended use of the data, on the level and frequency \\n\\nof measurement, and on the desire to track progress \\n\\nover time by aligning with past measures. within coun\\n-\\ntries, governments need to be able to track their own \\n\\nprogress and so need a consistent approach to measure-\\nment within their own setting. flexibility in coding and \\n\\nindicator definition is needed to ensure that data can \\n\\nbe analysed to meet both global and country needs. \\n\\nthis issue is currently prominent for antenatal care \\n\\nas who has increased the recommended number of \\n\\npregnancy contacts from four to eight antenatal visits,10 but most countries are yet to action such a transition \\n\\nand will continue to need to track coverage of at least \\n\\nfour visits for some time to come. similarly, the global \\n\\ndefinition and measurement of skilled attendance \\n\\nat birth is becoming more precise as quality-of-care \\n\\nissues are more prominent; but, in the face of acute \\n\\nhuman resource shortages and task-shifting policies, \\n\\nthere continues to be considerable variability between \\n\\ncountry level definitions of the cadres considered to \\n\\nprovide skilled care.11investmentacross multiple topics, investment is needed for better, validated indicators that are integrated in standardised data collection methods with sufficiently large sample \\nsizes for multiple disaggregation, while strengthening \\ncountry capacity in data analysis and use, to ultimately \\n\\naid data-informed decision-making and implementation. \\nwhether implicit or explicit, the language of this call for \\ninvestment primarily focused on investment in better \\nperiodic survey data rather than routine health informa\\n-\\ntion or indeed qualitative data sources.for example, the agenda to increase the rate of progress \\nin health by making sure that no one is left behind means \\n\\nthat we need to be able to gain greater insight from data. \\n\\nthis inevitably means larger household survey datasets \\n\\nwith bigger sample sizes for more granular, disaggregated \\n\\nanalysis. the analysis by victora et al makes clear the added \\n\\nvalue of extending relative equity analysis from quintiles \\n\\nto deciles of households, or of examining intersectionality \\n\\nbetween categories of inequality, for example place of resi\\n-\\ndence and socioeconomic status.12 this is important not \\nleast because of the positive evidence that slowly but surely \\n\\ninequities within and between countries are reducingšso \\n\\nthat differences are becoming more subtle, more complex.\\nin addition to gaining greater use from surveys, there \\nis also an imperative to invest in the country health infor\\n-mation systems. acknowledged as having potential to \\n\\ncontribute to data for decision-making, data from these \\nsources are frequently dismissed because of well-justified \\n\\nconcerns about data quality or because of the constraint \\nof working with imperfect denominators. nonetheless, \\n\\nthere are essential reasons for both global and national \\nactors to look for investment to improve on this. first, \\nmost country programmes want to base decision-making \\n\\non their own data and are motivated to build capacity \\nto manipulate their own data; this is well aligned with \\nglobal actor ambitions to support more effective coun-\\ntry-led data-driven decision-making for health. second, \\n\\nroutine data can be available in real time and analysed \\nat macro, meso or micro levels of granularity depending \\non needs and therefore uniquely suitable for real-time \\nmonitoring and course correction,13 again providing alignment for the global community to promote and \\n\\nsupport implementation science to increase the rate of \\nprogress in health. and third, there are many things that \\n\\nsurveys cannot reliably measure because the respondents \\n\\ndo not know the answer to questions, for example, treat-\\nment for illness or measures of healthcare quality.\\n14 for measurement of clinical care of this sort, facility data \\nsources need to be strengthened. and this would be to \\nthe benefit of the global community™s need for data that \\n\\ncan be analysed to better estimate the potential of health \\ngain that can be derived from contacts with the health \\nservice.\\n15 the countdown to 2030 has shifted its focus on collaborating with country public health institutions and \\n\\nministries of health to generate evidence and strengthen \\nanalytical capacity through regional initiatives. the goal \\n\\nis to further expand these collaborations and strengthen  on june 18, 2020 by guest. protected by copyright.http://gh.bmj.com/bmj glob health: first published as

disaster, children suffer ˚rst and suffer most. \\ntoday, one in four of the world™s children lives in a con˜ict or \\ndisaster zone š a fact that should shake each of us to our core. \\nall of these children face an uncertain future. \\nsadly, the number of countries experiencing con˜ict is at its \\nhighest point since the adoption of the convention on the rights \\nof the child in 1989. nearly nine years of war in the syrian arab \\nrepublic have left nearly 5 million children in need and more than \\n 2.5 million children living as refugees outside of the country. more \\nthan four years of con˜ict in yemen have created the world™s worst \\nhumanitarian crisis. about 1.2 million children in the central \\nafrican republic desperately need help after six years of war.\\nin other ongoing con˜icts in afghanistan, libya, mali, nigeria, \\nsomalia and south sudan š and many more š children pay \\nthe heaviest price. around the world, more than 30 million \\nchildren have been displaced by con˜ict. many of them are \\nbeing enslaved, traf˚cked, abused and exploited. many more \\nare living in limbo, without of˚cial immigration status or access \\nto education and health care. \\nfrom the rohingya refugee crisis in bangladesh to the out˜ow \\nof families from central america seeking a safer and more \\ndigni˚ed life, children have been uprooted by con˜ict and \\nviolence in historic numbers. \\ndiseases such as ebola and measles are also re-emerging, \\noften in con˜ict zones. they further complicate the \\nhumanitarian response in places where access is more and \\nmore restricted š such as in the democratic republic of the \\ncongo, where the current ebola outbreak is the world™s second \\nlargest and deadliest on record.\\nat the same time, extreme weather events are creating more \\nfrequent and destructive natural disasters worldwide. more \\nthan half a billion children now live in areas with extremely high \\n˜ood occurrence, and almost 160 million are in areas with high \\ndrought severity. regions like the sahel, where livelihoods rely \\non agriculture, grazing and ˚shing, are especially vulnerable to \\nthe effects of climate change. \\nall too often, armed groups exploit the social grievances that \\narise under such pressurized conditions. across west and \\ncentral africa, violence and insecurity are already robbing \\nnearly 2 million children š an entire generation š of their right \\nto education. \\nfaced with these challenges, unicef and partners have \\nresponded to emergencies in 61 countries in 2019. in the ˚rst \\neight months of the year, we provided humanitarian assistance \\nto nearly 29 million children œ substantially on track to reach the \\ntarget of 53 million by 31 december. \\nin eastern democratic republic of the congo, we worked with \\nlocal partners, community and religious leaders, the media\\n and businesses to bring life-saving information about the \\nebola virus to more than 25 million people at risk. in yemen, \\nwe provided mental health and psychosocial support to nearly \\n400,000 children and caregivers facing the horrors of war \\n foreword\\nhumanitarian action for children 2020\\n© unicef/un0299183/oatway\\nunicef\\n    <www.unicef.org/appeals\\n>3and displacement. in the bolivarian republic of venezuela, \\n we vaccinated more than 280,000 children to protect them from \\nmeasles and avert the spread of this dangerous but preventable \\ndisease. in mozambique, after two devastating cyclones, we have \\nimproved access to safe water for more than 1.5 million people.\\nbut the challenges persist. unicef™s appeal, \\nhumanitarian \\naction for children 2020\\n, aims to assist 59 million children in \\nhumanitarian emergencies in the coming year. \\nas unicef works to save young lives in these critical situations, \\nwe also innovate to make a sustained impact. cost-effective \\ninitiatives such as community-based education in afghanistan \\nand radio programming in burkina faso, for example, provide \\nalternative learning opportunities for children when schools are \\ntoo dangerous to attend. \\nin other cases, we provide training for community members, \\nincluding teachers, to cope with traumatic events themselves and \\nnurture children under stress. we have learned from experience \\nhow to identify and train members of affected communities to \\nprovide mental health and psychosocial support services. \\nsurvivors of gender-based violence, and women and girls \\nat risk, urgently need such support š and they are at the \\nforefront of humanitarian programming carried out by unicef \\nand partners. local women™s organizations such as the somali \\nwomen™s development centre, which operates support centres \\nand a hotline to address gender-based violence in mogadishu, \\nplay a central role in these efforts. \\nunicef also works to strengthen the links between humanitarian \\naction and development work. our presence in many countries \\nbefore, during and after emergencies delivers a continuum of \\nsupport. the rehabilitation and upgrade of water and sanitation \\nsystems serve vulnerable households in both the immediate \\ncrisis and the longer term, for instance. we also build the \\n long-term capacity of health ministries and civil society \\npartners to identify, treat and prevent chronic conditions such \\nas malnutrition. \\nsustainable interventions are important because crises are \\nnot one-time shocks; their impact can last for years. that is \\nwhy ˜exible funding is essential for multi-year planning to \\nrapidly and equitably reach every child at every stage of a \\nhumanitarian emergency and its aftermath. \\nchildren and young people affected by crises call for concrete \\naction to protect and promote their rights š today and into \\n the future. they want to be part of shaping the solutions. \\n we cannot answer their call without you, our partners. \\n but with our collective action, we can make a life-changing \\ndifference for children and young people at risk.\\nhenrietta h. fore\\n unicef executive director\\n© unicef/un0290983/tremeau\\nunicef\\n

humanitarian needs in 2019, \\nwhile extreme weather events, hunger and infectious diseases \\ndrove many people to seek and depend on emergency aid. millions \\nof children uprooted from their homes were in desperate need \\n of protection and humanitarian assistance. overall, 183.6 million \\npeople required humanitarian support globally during the year, \\n and more funding than ever was required to help them.\\nat the start of 2019, unicef requested us$3.92 billion through \\nthe humanitarian action for children appeal. by november, \\n the appeal had reached us$4.13 billion. escalating insecurity \\nand limited access to services in countries such as burkina \\nfaso, mali, the sudan and the bolivarian republic of venezuela, \\nas well as natural disasters, including cyclone idai in eastern \\nand southern africa and drought in angola, kenya, pakistan \\nand zimbabwe, contributed to the increasing needs.  \\ninternational humanitarian assistance from the public and private \\nsectors rose in 2019, compared with the same period in 2018. \\nby november, unicef had received us$1.58 billion\\n2 in donor \\ncommitments towards the humanitarian action for children \\nappeal. in addition, thanks to multi-year funding support, \\nunicef had us$761 million available from the previous year. \\nnearly two thirds of the funding received in 2019 came from \\nthe united states of america, the central emergency response \\nfund (cerf), the united kingdom of great britain and northern \\nireland, the european commission and germany. \\n1 figures presented in this narrative are provisional as of 1 november 2019 and \\nare subject to change.\\n2 provisional funds committed as of 1 november, as per the contribution \\nagreements against the current appeal year.\\ndespite the generous support of donors, as of november, the \\nfunding shortfall remained signi˚cant at 43 per cent. over half of the\\n funds received focused on the large-scale, protracted crises in the\\n democratic republic of the congo (including the ebola outbreak\\n response), south sudan, the syrian arab republic, neighbouring \\ncountries hosting syrian refugees and yemen. seventy-two \\n per cent of all commitments went to support 10 countries, out of\\n the 47 countries with appeals launched in 2019. many responses \\nremained underfunded, including the situations in burkina faso,\\n cameroon, pakistan, uganda and the bolivarian republic of \\nvenezuela œ all of which had funding gaps exceeding 70 per cent.\\nof the funds received in 2019, us$127.5 million (8 per cent) was \\nthematic funding for humanitarian responses at the country, \\nregional and global levels. global humanitarian thematic funding \\nœ the most ˜exible funding after regular resources œ made up \\n2 per cent of the total commitments received. allocations of \\nglobal humanitarian thematic funding were used to expand \\nactivities and respond to increasing needs in countries such as \\nburkina faso where displacement rose dramatically, and the \\nsudan, where violence and unrest continued to escalate. \\n these funds also enabled unicef to respond to cholera in haiti; \\n˚ll critical gaps in wash, nutrition and health in the democratic \\npeople™s republic of korea; and support the health response \\nand emergency preparedness in the state of palestine.\\nunicef will continue to adapt and respond to critical \\nhumanitarian needs as they evolve and advocate with partners \\nfor ˜exible thematic and multi-year funding, which is crucial to \\nmeeting the needs of

group for child mortality estimation\\nsummarybackground reducing neonatal mortality is an essential part of the third sustainable development goal (sdg), to end \\npreventable child deaths. to achieve this aim will require an understanding of the levels of and trends in neonatal \\n\\nmortality. we therefore aimed to estimate the levels of and trends in neonatal mortality by use of a statistical model \\n\\nthat can be used to assess progress in the sdg era. with these estimates of neonatal mortality between 1990 and 2017, \\n\\nwe then aimed to assess how di˜erent targets for neonatal mortality could a˜ect the burden of neonatal mortality \\n\\nfrom 2018 to 2030.methods in this systematic analysis, we used nationally-representative empirical data related to neonatal mortality, \\nincluding data from vital registration systems, sample registration systems, and household surveys, to estimate country-speci˚c neonatal mortality rates (nmr; the probability of dying during the ˚rst 28 days of life) for all countries between \\n\\n1990 (or the earliest year of available data) and 2017. for our analysis, we used all publicly available data on neonatal \\n\\nmortality from databases compiled annually by the un inter-agency group for child mortality estimation,\\n which were \\nextracted on or before july 31, 2018,\\n for data relating to the period between 1950 and 2017. all nationally representative \\ndata were assessed. we used a bayesian hierarchical penalised b-splines regression model, which allowed for data from \\ndi˜erent sources to be weighted di˜erently, to account for variable biases and for the uncertainty in nmr to be assessed. \\n\\nthe model simultaneously estimated a global association between nmr and under-5 mortality rate and country-speci˚c \\n\\nand time-speci˚c e˜ects, which enabled us to identify countries with an nmr that was higher or lower than expected. \\n\\nscenario-based projections were made at the county level by use of current levels of and trends in neonatal mortality and \\nhistoric or annual rates of reduction that would be required to achieve national targets. the main outcome that we \\nassessed was the levels of and trends in neonatal mortality and the global and regional nmrs from 1990 to 2017.findings between 1990 and 2017, the global nmr decreased by 51% (90% uncertainty interval [ui] 46œ54), from \\n36·6 deaths per 1000 livebirths (35·5œ37·8) in 1990, to 18·0 deaths per 1000 livebirths (17·0œ19·9) in 2017. the estimated number of neonatal deaths during the same period decreased from 5·0 million (4·9 millionœ5·2 million) to 2·5 million (2·4 millionœ2·8 million). annual nmrs vary widely across the world, but west and central africa and south asia had the highest nmrs in 2017. all regions have reported reductions in nmrs since 1990, and most \\nregions accelerated progress in reducing neonatal mortality in 2000œ17 versus 1990œ2000. between 2018 and 2030, we \\nproject that 27·8 million children will die in their ˚rst month of life if each country maintains its current rate of reduction in nmr. if each country achieves the sdg neonatal mortality target of 12 deaths per 1000 livebirths or \\nfewer by 2030, we project 22·7 million cumulative neonatal deaths by 2030. more than 60 countries need to accelerate \\n\\ntheir progress to reach the neonatal mortality sdg target by 2030.interpretation although substantial progress has been made in reducing neonatal mortality since 1990, increased \\ne˜orts to improve progress are still needed to achieve the sdg target by 2030. accelerated improvements are most \\nneeded in the regions and countries with high nmr, particularly in sub-saharan africa and south asia.\\nfunding \\nbill & melinda gates foundation, united

inter-agency group for child mortality \\nestimation (igme) has estimated the nmr for \\n\\n195 countries since 2011, producing trend estimates from \\n1990 to 2017. before 2015, a generalised linear model was \\n\\nused to estimate nmr, by use of un igme under-5 \\n\\nmortality rate (u5mr) estimates as a predictor.\\n4 the model di˛ered on the basis of data available; for countries \\nand regions with survey data, the relationship between \\nnmr and u5mr was modelled, with country-speci˜c \\nintercept parameters. for countries with high-quality \\n\\nvital registration, random-e˛ects parameters for slope or \\n\\ntrend parameters in a country were simultaneously \\nadded. although the previous model worked well in \\nestimating overall trends, the model had the limitation \\nthat it did not capture empirical data-driven country-\\nspeci˜c trends in countries without vital registration \\n\\nsystems because the estimates were driven by the u5mr \\n\\nestimates in the model, and hence the previous model \\ncould not capture country-speci˜c trends in the nmr \\nthat diverged from the changes expected in the u5mr.since 2015, a bayesian model for estimating nmr for all \\ncountries from 1990 (or earlier) onwards has been used by \\n\\nthe un igme. this method is similar to that used by the \\nun igme to estimate both u5mr and sex-speci˜c child \\n\\nmortality.\\n5,6 this model has the advantage that, compared \\nwith the previous model used by the un igme,4 it can \\ncapture empirical data trends in nmrs, both within \\n\\ncountries and over time for all countries with appropriate \\n\\ndata. often nmr is highest in locations where high-quality \\n\\nvital registration data are absent, thus a model to assess \\n\\ntrends in neonatal mortality in the sdg era was developed, \\n\\nto better capture trends in empirical data and to avoid \\n\\ntreating datapoints from di˛erent sources equally. the \\n\\nmodel also makes use of the entire data series for each \\n\\nsurvey and does not only use the most recent datapoint.we aimed to estimate the current state of and trends in \\nneonatal mortality at global, regional, and country levels \\nsince 1990 or earlier. we also aimed to develop projections \\n\\nof nmr and the associated numbers of deaths from 2018 \\nto 2030 under various scenarios to provide insight into \\nthe burden of neonatal deaths after 2017.\\nmethodsoverview\\nthe un igme was established in 2004, to report on \\n\\nprogress towards child survival goals, to improve methods \\n\\nfor estimating child mortality, and to enhance country \\n\\ncapacity to produce timely and properly assessed estimates \\n\\nof child mortality. the un igme is led by the un \\nresearch in context\\nevidence before this study\\nwe used all publicly available data on under-5 and neonatal \\n\\nmortality from the un inter-agency group for child mortality \\n\\nestimation (igme), which are compiled into databases annually. \\n\\nthis database is maintained to enable timely estimates of \\n\\nmortality, with the goal of improving monitoring of progress in \\n\\nreducing child mortality. nationally representative vital \\n\\nregistration data on neonatal mortality are available for about \\n\\n60 countries. for the remaining countries, data on neonatal \\n\\nmortality is collected via household surveys, vital registration, \\n\\nsample vital registration systems, or a combination of these. \\n\\nwe collected all available data on aug 1, 2018, on which date \\n\\nthe un igme global database contained about \\n\\n5700 observations spanning from july 1, 1950 (or earlier), to \\n\\njuly 1, 2017. all nationally representative data were included in \\n\\nthe database. previous estimates of neonatal mortality rates \\n\\nfrom this database had relatively large uncertainty intervals and \\n\\nthe models did not account for data-driven trends in neonatal \\n\\nmortality over time.\\nadded value of this study\\nour study extended the data in the existing un igme global \\n\\ndatabase by including new and updated observations and it \\n\\nincorporated updated hiv/aids estimates from unaids and \\n\\nrevised population numbers from the un population division. \\n\\nto our knowledge, our ˜ndings represent the ˜rst comprehensive \\n\\nanalysis of estimates of neonatal mortality rates up to 2017, \\n\\nand the ˜rst scenario-based projections from 2018 to 2030. \\nwe obtained estimates of neonatal mortality rates for \\n\\n195 countries between 1990 (or earlier) and 2017, by use of a \\n\\nbayesian hierarchical penalised b-splines regression model, which \\n\\nallowed for data from di˚erent sources to be weighted di˚erently \\n\\nand for the uncertainty in these data to be assessed. estimates of \\n\\nthe mortality rates and associated indicators, such as annual rates \\n\\nof change, aggregated regional outcomes, and uncertainty \\n\\nintervals, help to assess the levels of and trends in neonatal \\n\\nmortality and to monitor progress in child survival. our \\n\\nestimation method improves on previous methods by \\n\\nincorporation of data-driven changes in the empirical data on \\n\\nneonatal mortality over time as an input in the model, accounting \\n\\nfor sampling errors, and producing more realistic uncertainty \\n\\nintervals. our model allows identi˜cation of countries and regions \\n\\nwith outlying patterns of neonatal mortality.\\nimplications of all the available evidence\\nalthough substantial progress has been made in reducing \\nneonatal mortality since 1990, increased e˚orts to improve \\n\\nprogress are still needed to achieve the sustainable \\n\\ndevelopment goal (sdg) target. without any acceleration in \\n\\nthe pace of reduction of neonatal mortality, we project that \\n\\n1·8 million neonates (ie, those in the ˜rst 28 days of life) will die \\n\\nin 2030. however, if each country achieved the sdg target by \\n\\n2030, there would be about 1\\n·2 million neonatal deaths in\\n \\n2030. however, achieving this goal requires increased e˚orts to \\n\\nenable continued improvements in child survival, especially in \\n\\nthe high-burden regions of south asia and sub-saharan africa.\\nwww.thelancet.com/lancetgh   \\nvol 7   june 2019\\n e712international children™s emergency fund (unicef), and \\nit

relating to the period between july 1, 1950, and july 1, 2017.\\n we estimated the ratio of nmr to other child mortality \\n\\n(ie, [u5mrœnmr]) and obtained estimates of nmr by \\nrecombining the ratios with u5mr estimates. the \\ntechnical details on the model speci˜cation, imple\\n-mentation, and validation are available elsewhere.11the ratio was modelled as the product of two com\\n-ponents: the expected ratio and a country-year-speci˜c \\n\\nmultiplier. the expected ratio provides the expected \\n\\nassociation between the ratio and the current u5mr in a \\nparticular country and year. we explored parametric and \\n\\nnon-parametric forms for the global association between \\nthe expected ratio and u5mr, and we found that the \\nassociation between the log (ratio) and log (u5mr) is well captured by a linear function with a changing slope, \\nsuggesting a constant ratio at low u5mr and a decreasing \\nratio as the u5mr increases.the second component, the country-year-speci˜c mul\\n-tiplier, allows countries to have ratios that are higher or \\n\\nlower than expected given the current u5mr, compared \\nwith the global association. the country-speci˜c multi-pliers were modelled with penalised splines regression, \\nand they can be interpreted as a country-speci˜c intercept \\n\\nplus ˚uctuations over time.12 the splines regression intercepts, and smoothing parameters were modelled \\nhierarchically, and the ˚uctuations were penalised to \\n\\nensure smooth trajectories over time. the inclusion of \\nthis country-year-speci˜c multiplier in the model allows \\n\\nfor data-driven changes in the nmr across countries and \\nover time within countries. this component also allows \\nfor the identi˜cation of outlying countriesšie, those \\nwith relatively large (or small) higher-than-expected \\n\\n(or lower than expected) ratios given the current u5mr, \\ncompared with the global association.nmr estimates were based on data from many sources. \\nas part of the modelling process, a data model was used \\nto capture and account for uncertainty in observations. \\nthe data model incorporated stochastic error for vital \\nregistration data (to capture uncertainty in the outcomes \\nof random events) and sampling error and non-sampling \\nerror (eg, misreporting of age and sex and survivor \\nselection bias) for survey data from di˛erent sources. inclusion of these types of uncertainty in the data model \\nallowed for the downweighting of observations that are \\nless informative of the true ratio, compared with more \\n\\ninformative observations.we used a markov chain monte carlo algorithm, \\nimplemented with jags software version 4.3.0\\n13 within for \\nun igme child mortality data see www.childmortality.org\\nsee online for appendixe713 www.thelancet.com/lancetgh   \\nvol 7   june 2019\\nr version 3.3.3, to generate samples from the posterior distributions of the nmr ratios, and combined these \\nsamples with posterior samples of the u5mr to obtain samples of the nmr. the result was a set of trajectories \\nof nmr over time for each country. the best estimate \\n\\nwas taken to be the median of these trajectories, and \\n\\n90% uncertainty intervals were computed by use of the \\n5th and 95th percentiles of the samples from the \\nposterior distributions. estimates and associated \\nuncertainty of neonatal deaths for each country over time \\nwere obtained by combining the trajectories of nmr \\nwith livebirths. adjustments to crisis-a˛ected country-\\n\\nyears were made after estimation.\\nwe used the global association between the ratio of \\nneonatal mortality to under-5 mortality and the u5mr\\n \\nunder-5 mortality to calculate the expected nmr. we \\n\\nde˜ned countries as outlying if the absolute di˛erence \\nbetween the point estimates of the estimated and the \\nexpected nmr was larger than one per 1000 livebirths, \\nand if the lower (or upper) bound of the 90% uncertainty \\ninterval for the estimated nmr was at least 10% higher \\n\\n(or lower) than the expected nmršie, if the posterior \\nprobability that the ratio of the estimated nmr to the \\nexpected nmr was at least 1\\n·1 (or, at most, 0\\n·9) was more than 95%. identifying outliers allows us to pinpoint \\ncountries with unusually low or high neonatal mortality, \\n\\ngiven their overall under-5 mortality (appendix pp 3, 4).\\nscenario-based projections from 2018 to 2030\\nwe projected nmrs and the number of neonatal deaths \\nunder ˜ve scenarios from 2018 to 2030. neonatal mor\\n-tality was projected based on either a constant nmr or a \\ndecreasing nmr using an annual rate of reduction \\n(arr) de˜ned as arr=log(nmrt2/nmrt1)/(t1 œ t2), where t˙ and tˆ refer to di˛erent years with t1<t2.in the ˜rst scenario, we estimated neonatal mortality if \\nthe nmr were to remain at 2017 rates in all countries. in \\n\\nthe second scenario, we assumed that the arr in each \\ncountry from 2000 to 2017 would continue from 2018 to \\n2030. if the arr from 2000 to 2017 was negative, we kept \\nthe country™s nmr constant and, for all countries, we \\n\\nconstrained that the ratio of nmr/u5mr to ensure that \\n\\nit did not exceed the highest ratios in a country with good \\nvital registration data (finland, 0\\n·78) during the \\n\\nprojection period. in the third scenario, we projected the \\n\\narr in each country if it were equal to the arr from the \\nbest performing country in the regionšie, the country \\nwith the highest arr in 2000œ17. in the fourth scenario, \\n\\nwe calculated the necessary arr for each country to \\nachieve the sdg target of an annual nmr of 12 deaths \\nper 1000 livebirths or fewer by 2030. finally, for the ˜fth \\n\\nscenario, we calculated the necessary arr for each \\ncountry to achieve the current average nmr in the \\ngroup of high-income countries of three deaths per \\n1000 livebirths by 2030.\\n10 for countries that had already \\nreached or would reach the targets in scenarios 4, 5, or \\nboth, projections from scenario 2 were used. in all scenarios, if a country reached the current lowest \\n\\nnmr observed among countries with more than \\n10 000 livebirths (namely, 0\\n·9 deaths per 1000 livebirths annually in japan), its nmr remained at that level for the \\n\\nrest of the projected period.we calculated the number of neonatal deaths in each \\nscenario from the medium variant population projections \\n\\nfrom the un population division.\\n14 we did not consider \\nother e˛ects, including changing mortality rates, on \\n\\npopulation numbers. thus, the scenarios do not indicate \\n\\nthe real number of lives to be saved, but they illustrate the \\n\\npotential number of lives that could be saved by reductions \\nin neonatal mortality while maintaining the median \\n\\nnumber of births reported to the un population division. \\n\\nour projections for neonatal mortality reductions are \\n\\nbased on past trends, but they do not consider how \\n\\nimprovement in intervention coverage and quality of care \\n\\ncould advance newborn survival.role of the

mortality. a comparison of \\n\\nestimated with expected data thus allows us to pinpoint \\ncountries with nmrs that are higher or lower than \\nexpected when compared with the u5mr-implied \\noutcomes. globally, the ratio of the estimated nmr \\n\\nto expected nmr was signi˜cantly more than 1·12 \\n(90% uncertainty interval 1·10œ1·14) in 1990 but, in 2017, this ratio was no longer signi˜cantly di˛erent from 1, at \\n1·02 (0·97œ1·08; ˜gure 1; appendix pp 11œ12). however, \\n\\ndi˛erent patterns of estimated to expected nmr ratios \\napplied to di˛erent countries and regions. in 1990, this \\nratio was 1·36 (1·33œ1·40) times higher than expected in \\nsouth asia, and 1·08 (1·02œ1·14) times higher than expected in east asia and the paci˜c, whereas this ratio \\n\\nwas signi˜cantly lower than expected in east and \\nsouth africa, latin america and the caribbean, \\n\\nnorth america, and west and central africa.\\n by 2017, \\nonly south asia had a high estimated nmr to expected \\nnmr ratio, which was 1·23 (1·16œ1·30) times higher than expected, and only west and central africa had a \\nratio that was lower than expected, of 0·87 (0·78œ0·96) times lower than expected (˜gure 1; appendix pp 11œ12).patterns of estimated nmr to expected nmr ratios \\nin south asia were driven by country-speci˜c outlying \\n\\nnmrs. among the countries in south asia (afghanistan, \\n\\nbangladesh, bhutan, india, the maldives, nepal, pakistan, \\n\\nand sri lanka), we found consistently and signi˜cantly \\n\\nhigher ratios of nmr to u5mrs over the last 25 years \\n\\nin afghanistan, india, and pakistan (\\n˜gure 3) and in \\n\\nbangladesh and nepal in 1990œ2010. overall, fewer \\n\\ncountries showed higher or lower nmrs than expected in \\n\\n2017 than in 1990. the number of countries with 10% \\n\\nhigher-than-expected nmrs, which represented an \\n\\nabsolute di˛erence between the point estimates of the \\n\\nestimated annual nmr and the expected annual nmr of \\n\\nat least one death per 1000 livebirths and more than \\n10 000 livebirths in 2017, decreased from 14 countries \\nto 12 countries between 1990 and 2017, whereas the \\n\\nnumber of countries with 10% lower-than-expected \\n\\nnmrs decreased from 25 countries to ˜ve countries.in our projection, we found that, if countries main-tained their 2017 nmrs (scenario 1), the global annual \\n\\nnmr would increase to 19·0 deaths per 1000 livebirths \\nand we would expect 2·7 million neonatal deaths in 2030 \\n(˜gure 4; appendix pp 12œ14). these numbers are higher \\nthan the 2017 estimates because of projected increases in \\nthe proportions of livebirths occurring in countries with \\nhigh mortality. in this ˜rst scenario, during the entire \\n\\nperiod from 2018 to 2030, 37·6 million neonates would die. under scenario 2, if each country maintained their \\n\\ncurrent arr, by 2030, the global annual nmr would \\ndecrease to 13·2 deaths per 1000 livebirths and an \\nestimated 1·8 million neonates would die. the \\ncumulative 27·8 million neonatal deaths occurring \\nduring 2018œ30 would account for almost half of the projected 56 million deaths in children younger than \\n5 years under a similar scenario.10 in this scenario, the proportion of neonatal deaths in the overall under-5 \\n\\ndeaths would increase from 47% in 2017\\n to 53% in 2030. \\nunder scenario 3, assuming that each country would \\nhave the same arr in neonatal mortality as the best \\nperforming country in the region, the annual nmr \\nwould decrease to 10·0 deaths per 1000 livebirths and \\n1·4 million children would die in 2030, with an estimated \\n\\n24 million neonatal deaths between 2018 to 2030. by our \\nestimates for scenario 4, which projects all countries \\nachieving the sdg target (12 deaths per 1000 livebirths) \\nby 2030, the global annual nmr would further decrease \\nto 8·8 deaths per 1000 livebirths and 1·2 million neonates \\nwould die in 2030. between 2018 and 2030, we estimated \\nthat the cumulative neonatal deaths under scenario 4 \\nwould be 22·7 million, about 5 million fewer than under scenario 2, which assumed that countries maintained \\n\\ntheir 2017 arr. to achieve this sdg goal by 2030, more \\n\\nthan 60 countries need to accelerate progress (appendix \\np 59), a higher number of countries than for the u5mr \\ntarget (u5mr of 23 or lower; 51 countries).\\n10 among countries with more than 10 000 livebirths in 2017, 15 countries will not achieve the neonatal mortality \\nsdg target at their estimated nmr under scenario 2, but \\nthese countries would achieve the under-5 mortality sdg \\n\\ntarget by 2030. 42 of more than 60 countries need to more than double their past reductions in nmr; the \\nrequired arr to meet the sdg target by 2030 is at least \\ntwo times larger than the observed arr in these \\ncountries (appendix p 61). even more deaths could be \\n\\naverted if every country would at least reach the \\nannual nmr of high-income countries (3 deaths per \\n1000 livebirths) by 2030, as we projected under scenario 5: figure ˚:\\n estimated to expected ratios for a given under-5 mortality,

2019\\nthe global nmr would further decrease to 2·7 deaths per 1000 livebirths and 0·4 million neonates would die in 2030. in this scenario, we would project 13·5 million cumulative deaths during 2018œ30.discussiondespite substantial progress, 2·5 million neonates died in 2017 alone, and huge disparities in neonatal mortality \\n\\npersist across regions and countries. at the country level, \\n\\nannual nmrs ranged from 44·2 to 0·9 deaths per \\n1000 livebirths in 2017; in 17 countries the annual nmr was more than 30 deaths per 1000 livebirths whereas, in \\n17 countries, the annual rate was less than 2 deaths per \\n1000 livebirths (appendix pp 14œ23). countries with the \\n\\nhighest nmrs were concentrated in sub-saharan africa \\n\\nand south asia, and countries with the lowest nmrs \\nwere in western europe.the survival of neonates has improved substantially \\nbetween 1990 and 2017: we found a 51% reduction in the \\n\\nnmr and a decrease in the annual number of deaths from \\n5 million to 2\\n·5 million. an estimated 103 million neo\\n-nates died during this time and, although an acceleration \\n\\nin neonatal mortality reductions (ie, the arr) since 2000 \\n\\ncan be observed, the acceleration was less pronounced in \\n\\nneonates than among other children younger than 5 years. \\n\\nprogress in reducing neonatal mortality in the high-\\nmortality regions in sub-saharan africa has been modest, \\n\\nwith a regional average arr of 1·9% during 1990œ2017. \\nhowever, current neonatal mortality remains high; in \\n\\nalmost a third of the countries in the region, annual \\n\\nnmrs were more than 30 deaths per 1000 livebirths in \\n\\n2017, and two-thirds of countries that are at risk of missing \\n\\nthe sdg neonatal mortality target are in sub-saharan \\n\\nafrica, according to our projections.focusing on the neonatal period implies that policy \\nmakers need to address the main causes of neonatal \\nmortality, which di˛er from the causes of deaths of older \\n\\nchildren. neonates predominantly die because of \\n\\npreterm birth and intrapartum-related complications and \\n\\ninfections, such as sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia. \\naccording to estimates by who and the maternal \\n\\nand child epidemiology estimation group, 35% of all \\nneonatal deaths in 2017 were due to complications \\nassociated with preterm birth; 24% of deaths were \\nassociated with intrapartum events, such as birth \\nasphyxia; 14% of deaths were due to sepsis or meningitis; \\n\\nand 11% were associated with congenital anomalies.15 more neonates survived birth and avoided infectious \\n\\ndiseases in 2017 than in 2000, and the proportion of \\ndeaths associated with premature births and congenital \\nanomalies in\\n creased during this \\ntime. prevention of \\nneonatal deaths due to prematurity and congenital \\nanomalies could help to reduce neonatal mortality, even \\n\\nin low-mortality settings. e˛orts are also needed to \\naddress disparities within countries, since children born \\n\\nin poorer resource settings often have worse health \\n\\noutcomes than children with more resources.16,17to improve neonatal survival, it is crucial to ensure \\nevery pregnant woman and neonate has access to \\n\\nlifesaving interventions.\\n18œ21 a substantial proportion of \\nneonatal deaths can be prevented by relatively straight-forward but e˛ective interventions delivered along the \\n\\ncontinuum of care during pre-pregnancy, antenatal, \\n\\nintrapartum, delivery, postpartum, and postnatal periods \\n\\nfor mothers and their newborns. it is essential that \\n\\nnewborn babies receive appropriate care and nutritional \\n\\nsupport.22 prematurity and low birthweight can be largely \\naddressed through interventions related to antenatal care, \\n\\neducation, nutrition, and maternal health. further \\n\\nimprovements in neonatal survival will require a higher \\n\\nproportion of deliveries occurring in well equipped \\nfacilities with high-quality care. considerable invest\\n ments \\nin terms of training and health infrastructure are needed \\n\\nto enable skilled birth attendants to deliver lifesaving \\n\\ninterventions, especially during delivery and the ˜rst week \\n\\nof life.23 additionally, improvements in postnatal care \\ninter ventions need to be scaled up, particularly in

where and when \\nneonatal death occur and what causes delays is key to \\n\\ndesigning context-speci˜c community and health system \\n\\nstrategies. to do so, it is necessary to focus on homes and \\n\\nfacilities as well as on communication and transportation, \\n\\nto reduce delays in service deliveries, but also to intensify \\n\\nresearch to identify obstacles in service deliveries.our estimates suggest that south asia is a notable outlier \\nwith respect to its ratio of neonatal to under-5 mortality \\n\\nand overall level of under-5 mortality; we found that this \\n\\nregion has one of the highest ratios of nmr to u5mr and \\n\\na high overall u5mr compared with other regions. the \\n\\nneonatal mortality in south asian countries tends to be \\n\\nhigher than expected given the global pattern. household \\n\\nsurvey data that track important components of health for \\n\\nmothers and neonates indicate that the prevalence of low \\n\\nbirthweights (ie, less than 2·5 kg) for the years 2009œ13 \\n\\nwas highest in south asia, with around a quarter of births \\nwith a low birthweight, and a prevalence of low birth weight \\nof more than 10% of births in sub-saharan

(with a \\n\\nrange of 51œ86% in the countries).\\n28 besides coverage, \\nattention needs to be placed on the quality of care, since \\n\\nstudies23,29 show that survival bene˜ts expected for

nmrs. additionally, national averages \\n\\ncan hide disparities within regions. according to the \\nmillion death study\\n17 in india, the neonatal mortality \\ncaused by prematurity or low birthweight was increasing \\n\\nin rural areas and poorer states from 2000 to 2015, while it \\n\\ndecreased in urban areas and richer states. evidence is not \\n\\nsu˝cient to conclude on the

\\n\\nimplementing interventions to reduce neonatal mortality \\n\\nand to understand the mechanism behind disparities in \\n\\nregions and countries and within countries.in the absence of reliable and standardised vital \\nregistration and administrative data in many countries, \\n\\nmodelling of nmrs remains necessary for public health \\n\\npolicy and priority setting and monitoring. only around \\n\\n70% of children younger than 5 years have a birth \\ncerti˜cate,30 and most neonatal deaths do not result in the \\nissue of a death certi˜cate.25 data on causes of neonatal \\ndeaths and

their rate with 95% probability. more \\ninvestment is urgently required to improve data col lection \\nand data quality, to better distinguish real country-level \\n\\ne˛ects from data issues. additionally, more in-depth \\n\\nstudies are required to analyse potential reporting biases \\n\\nfor stillbirths, early neonatal deaths, and livebirths in \\n\\nsurveys, surveillance data, and vital registration data. \\n\\neven in high-quality civil registration systems, large \\n\\ninternational di˛erences in recording of births and deaths \\n\\nexist between countries, which can lead to variation in \\n\\nnmrs and stillbirth rates, particularly at extremely early \\n\\ngestations when survival is low.\\n32 to better estimate \\nneonatal mortality, improvements to counting methods \\n\\nfor neonatal deaths and stillbirths is crucial for tracking \\n\\nsdg targets and improving vital statistics.fewer countries showed an outlying pattern in 2017 \\nthan in 1990. this decrease was mostly due to fewer \\ncountries with a lower-than-expected nmr given the \\n\\nlevel of under-5 mortality in 2017 than in 1990. one could \\n\\nassume that under-reporting of neonatal deaths is more \\n\\nlikely than over-reporting, and this bias would result in \\n\\nlower-than-expected neonatal mortality estimates in our \\n\\nmodel rather than in higher-than-expected neonatal \\n\\nmortality estimates. with improved reporting of neonatal \\n\\ndeaths over time, we would expect fewer outliers with \\nlower-than-expected neonatal mortality for recent years \\n\\nthan for past years. given that we cannot clearly \\n\\ndistinguish data quality issues from abnormal country \\n\\npatterns, more in-depth country analysis is needed to \\n\\nsupport this conclusion of improved data quality.\\nat the global level, our neonatal mortality estimates for \\n2017 are similar to those produced for the same year in \\n2018 by the global burden of disease (gbd) study.\\n33 the gbd global neonatal mortality was estimated as \\n16·8 deaths per 1000 livebirths34 in 2017 and the annual u5mr was estimated as 38\\n·9 deaths per 1000 livebirths \\n\\n(or 40·6 in the appendix of the same article).33 additionally, the projections by the institute of health \\n\\nmetrics and evaluation (ihme) in 2017, based on past \\n\\ntrends, suggest that the global nmr would decrease to \\n\\n11·8 deaths per 1000 livebirths by 2030 from 16·8 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2017.\\n34 these results are similar to our scenario 2, of maintaining current trends in arrs of \\nnmr, in which we projected a global annual nmr of \\n\\n13·2 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2030. the correlation \\ncoe˝cient of the two sets of country-speci˜c point \\nestimates for the 187 countries assessed for 1990œ2017 is \\n0·97 for nmr, 0·98 for u5mr, and 0·90 for the ratio of nmr to u5mr. di˛erences between the two sets of \\nestimates arise through di˛erences in input data, \\nprocessing of input data, and modelling approaches. for \\nmost countries, di˛erences in the neonatal and under-5 \\n\\nmortality rates are small. large di˛erences are found for \\n\\nsome countries between un igme and ihme gbd \\nestimates: 29 countries showed an absolute di˛erence in \\nnmr between the datasets that was more than ˜ve \\ndeaths per 1000 livebirths and relative di˛erences greater \\nthan 10% in 2017, and 32 countries showed an absolute \\ndi˛erence in the u5mr between the datasets that was \\nmore than ten deaths per 1000 livebirths and a relative \\n\\ndi˛erence greater than 10% in 2017. di˛erences in the \\n\\nmortality rates tend to occur in countries with no recent \\n\\navailable input data, small populations, or recent crises. \\n\\nfinally, for the ratio of nmr to u5mr, 23 countries \\n\\nshowed an absolute di˛erence between these datasets \\n\\nof 0·1 and a relative di˛erence greater than 10% in 2017. \\n\\ndi˛erences in the ratios occur mostly at very low levels of \\nmortality. a comparison of the estimates for nmr, \\n\\nu5mr, and ratio of nmr to u5mr for all 187 countries \\nfor the years 1990, 2000, and 2017 is shown in the appendix (pp 39œ51). a previous decom\\n position study on \\nthe di˛erences in under-5 mortality estimates between \\n\\nthe un igme and gbd shows that di˛erences in input \\ndata contributed substantially to the discrepancies in \\nthe estimates.35 we expect that, with increasing data \\navailability, the estimates will further converge.\\nto conclude, to advance child survival and achieve the \\nsdg goals, it is important to focus on neonatal survival. \\nwithout intensi˜ed commitment to neonatal survival, \\n\\nmany countries will not be able to meet the sdg goal to \\nend preventable child deaths. our projections suggest \\nthat more countries are at risk of missing the neonatal \\nmortality sdg target than the under-5 mortality target \\n\\n(appendix pp 60œ61). half of the more than 60 countries \\n\\nthat would not achieve the neonatal mortality sdg target \\nif they continue their current arr in nmr would only \\nachieve the target after 2050. almost two-thirds of these \\n\\ncountries are in sub-saharan africa and two are in south \\n\\nasia. without acceleration, our projections indicate that, \\n\\nwith no improvement in neonatal mortality, 27\\n·8 million neonates will die between 2018 and 2030. if interventions \\nwere scaled-up and the quality of care increased, then the \\nlives of thousands of newborns could be saved and the \\nsdg target achieved in countries that are behind in \\n\\nreducing neonatal mortality. if the sdg target would be \\n\\nachieved on time in the countries that are at risk of falling \\nbehind, the lives of 5 million neonates could be saved \\n\\nfrom 2018 to 2030. far more newborn lives could be \\n\\nsaved if every country achieved the average nmr of high-\\n\\nincome countries, indicating that progress should not \\n\\nend with achieving the sdg neonatal mortality target.contributorsla and dy initiated the study and provided overall guidance. lh and dy \\ncompiled the data base, analysed ˜ndings, and constructed and analysed \\nthe projection

expert convening\\nan estimated 67 000 adolescents die each y\\near from \\nself-harm, and far morešan estimated 10% of all \\nadolescentsšhave intentionally harmed themselves.\\n1 suicide consistently ranks among the leading causes of \\ndeath for older adolescent girls and boys globally, and \\ndepressive disorders, anxiety, behavioural problems, and \\n\\nself-harm are among the greatest contributors to young \\n\\npeople™s burden of disease.\\n1 academics, practitioners, \\nand advocates increasingly recognise the importance of \\n\\nmental health to the overall wellbeing of adolescents, and \\n\\nthe complex linkages between gender and mental health.\\n2 as outlined in a more detailed paper,\\n2 gender norms can \\nnegatively a˜ect adolescent girls and boys, but particularly \\n\\nlimit girls™ ambitions and opportunities. yet\\n policies and \\n\\nprogrammes, particularly in low-income and middle-\\nincome countries, do not adequately address these \\n\\nimportant issues. to better understand these relationships \\n\\nand identify priorities for adolescent-focused and gender-\\n\\nresponsive mental health research and programmes, the \\n\\ninternational center for research on women and unicef \\n\\nconvened experts from academia, civil society, donor, and \\n\\nbilateral and multilateral institutions for a consultation in \\n\\napril, 2017 (appendix). in this comment, we summarise\\n their recommendations. \\nfirstly,\\n data for and indicators on the gendered drivers \\nof poor mental health in adolescence are required. age-disaggregated and sex-disaggregated data\\n are necessary \\nto understand the epidemiological burden and unmet \\n\\nneed for mental health prevention and care among \\n\\nadolescent girls and boys. however, reviews done for the \\n\\nglobal burden of disease study indicate that \\ntwo-thirds \\nof countries have no data for any mental disorder, and \\n\\nthat data for mental disorders in those aged 5œ17 years \\n\\nare available for only 6\\n·7% of these countries.\\n3 when also considering the \\nworld health statistics,\\n4 which reports that half of deaths have no recorded cause, it \\n\\nis clear there is a need for improved hospital records, \\n\\nhealth surveys, and vital registration systems among \\n\\nother data sources. furthermore, i\\nndicators and \\nframeworks for adolescent mental health have mostly \\n\\nbeen developed and applied only in high-income \\ncountries, with few tested for cross-cultural use, and \\n\\neven fewer for gender-sensitivity.\\nsecondly, understanding pathways through which \\ngender norms in˚uence adolescent mental health is \\nessential. during childhood, girls are no more likely \\nthan are boys to manifest symptoms of depression, \\n\\nbut after puberty their risk of depressive disorders \\n\\nincreases substantially. moreover, girls are one and \\n\\na half to two times more likely than are boys to be \\n\\ndiagnosed with clinical depression in adolescence and \\n\\nthroughout their life course.\\n5 the paper\\n2 produced for \\nthe expert convening addresses some gendered aspects \\n\\nof adolescent mental health, yet far more research is \\n\\nneeded on the mechanisms through which gender \\n\\nnorms might a˜ect the mental health of girls and boys \\n\\ndi˜erentially. given the paucity of currently available \\n\\ndata, implications for vulnerable adolescents, such as \\n\\npregnant, married, out-of-school, and lgbtqi (lesbian, \\n\\ngay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and \\n\\nintersex) adolescents, also urgently require attention. \\nthirdly, implementation and programmatic research \\nto improve adolescent mental wellbeing are needed.\\n mental health and psychosocial support programmes for \\nadolescents in low-income and middle-income countries \\n\\nhave largely \\nbeen con˛ned to humanitarian settings; \\n\\nhowever, few of these programmes have been rigorously \\n\\nevaluated, and fewer yet speci˛cally incorporate gender \\n\\nconsiderations.6 although some evidence suggests \\nschool-based interventions can reduce depression and \\n\\nanxiety, there is limited understanding of how gender \\n\\nmight in˚uence students™ mental health in these \\n\\ncountries.7 programmes that do not explicitly focus on \\nmental health can provide new opportunities to address \\n\\nthe e˜ect of harmful gender norms. at the same time, \\n\\nmore information is needed to understand whether \\n\\nand how programmes and interventions that are \\n\\ndeliberately designed to be gender-responsive or gender-\\n\\ntransformative are, in fact, e˜ective at improving mental \\n\\nhealth outcomes among adolescents.\\nlastly, incorporation of adolescent mental health into \\nnational policy agendas is crucial. mental health and \\ndavid synder\\nsee online for appendixlancet child adolesc health\\n 2017published online november 27, 2017

health have both been neglected in low-\\nincome and middle-income countries, due in part to a \\n\\npaucity of funding and overburdened health systems. \\n\\ncountry-level policies can drive the coordination of \\n\\nessential services and activities to most e˜ectively and \\n\\ne˝ciently ensure that prevention, diagnosis, and care are \\n\\ndelivered to those in need. as a start, mental health and \\n\\nadolescent health policies that do exist in low-income and \\n\\nmiddle-income countries should consider the potential \\n\\nimpact of gender and gender norms.\\n global attention to adolescent health has increased \\nsubstantially in the past several years. recently, the un \\n\\nsecretary general™s every woman every child movement \\n\\nadded adolescent health to its agenda, and who and \\n\\nits partners issued the global accelerated action for the \\n\\nhealth of adolescents guidance\\n1 to help countries generate \\nand use data to develop and implement adolescent-\\n\\nfocused health programmes and policies. as the evidence \\n\\nbase on adolescent health continues to increase, there \\n\\nis a growing recognition of the importance of mental \\n\\nhealth to the overall health and wellbeing of adolescents, \\nboth now and later in life. our hope is that improved \\n\\nunderstanding of the distinct mental health challenges \\n\\nthat adolescent girls and boys face, and particularly of \\n\\nhow these challenges are in˚uenced by gender norms and \\n\\ninequities, can help spur future research and action (panel).*chisina kapungu,

nutrition\\nthese are the children who \\nare \\nnot \\ngrowing well\\n.their numbers are worryingly high. globally, \\none in three children under the age of 5 \\nis stunted, wasted or overweight and, in \\nsome cases suffers from a combination of \\ntwo of these forms of malnutrition. in east \\nasia and paci˜c it is almost one in ˜ve.\\nthe triple burden of malnutritionundernutrition \\ncontinues to affect tens \\nof millions of children. its presence is \\nvisible in the stunted bodies of children \\ndeprived of adequate nutrition in the ˜rst \\n1,000 days and beyond. these children \\nmay carry the burden of early stunting for \\nthe rest of their lives and may never meet \\ntheir full physical and intellectual potential. \\nundernutrition is also evident in the wasted \\nbodies of children when circumstances like \\nfood shortages, poor feeding practices and \\ninfection, often compounded by poverty, \\nhumanitarian crises and con˚ict, deprive \\nthem of adequate nutrition and, in far too \\nmany cases, result in death. in 2018, 149 \\nmillion children under 5 were stunted and \\nalmost 50 million were wasted. in east asia \\nand paci˜c, 13 million children under 5 were \\nstunted and 4.5 million were wasted.\\nde˜ciencies of essential vitamins and minerals \\nœ hidden hunger\\n œ rob children of their \\nvitality at every stage of life and undermine \\nthe health and well-being of children, young \\npeople and mothers. the numbers of children \\nand women affected by various forms of \\nhidden hunger are striking. recent global \\nestimates by unicef and partners indicate \\na changing world\\nit is twenty years since \\nthe state of the \\nworld™s children\\n last examined children™s \\nnutrition, and, in that time, much has changed. \\nwe have changed where we live: \\nmore families have left behind the \\ncountryside and moved to cities.\\nwe have changed our roles: women \\nare increasingly joining the formal \\nworkforce, balancing work responsibilities \\nwith their role as primary caregivers, \\nand often with little support from \\nfamilies, employers and societies.\\nlife on our planet has changed: climate \\nchange, the loss of biodiversity, and \\nenvironmental damage now raise \\nconcerns over whether we can feed \\nthis generation of children sustainably, \\nnever mind the generations to come.\\nand we have changed what we eat: we are \\nleaving behind traditional diets and embracing \\nmodern diets that are frequently high in \\nsugars and fats, low in essential nutrients.\\nthis is the backdrop to children™s malnutrition \\ntoday. like so much else, it, too, is changing. \\na word once inextricably linked in the \\npublic™s mind to images of hunger and \\nfamine, malnutrition must now be used \\nto describe children with stunting and \\nwasting, but also those suffering from the \\n‚hidden hunger™ of de˜ciencies in essential \\nvitamins and minerals as well as the growing \\nnumbers of children and young people who \\nare affected by overweight or obesity. \\n in 2018,  13 million \\nchildren under 5 \\nwere stunted and  \\n 4.5 million were \\nwasted in east asia \\nand the paci˜c\\n 3  |  the state of the world™s children 2019\\nthat at least 340 million children under 5 \\n(one in two) suffer from hidden hunger.\\nthe number girls and boys with obesity \\nbetween the ages of 5 and 19 have soared \\nsince the mid-1970s, rising by between 10- \\nand 12-fold globally. \\noverweight\\n and \\nobesity\\n, long thought of as conditions of the wealthy, \\nare now increasingly a condition of the poor, \\nre˚ecting the greater availability of ‚cheap \\ncalories™ from fatty and sugary foods around \\nthe world. they bring with them a heightened \\nrisk of non-communicable diseases, like type \\n2 diabetes. analysis carried out as part of \\nthe global burden of disease study suggest \\nthat diets lacking adequate nutrition are now \\nthe leading cause of death worldwide.\\nsurviving, but not thriving\\nmore children and young people are \\nsurviving, but far too few are thriving. \\nto understand malnutrition today requires \\na focus on food and diet at every stage of \\na child™s life. the picture that emerges is a \\ntroubling one: \\nfar too many children and \\nyoung people are eating too little healthy \\nfood and too much unhealthy food.\\n these problems start early on: in their ˜rst \\nsix months, only two out of ˜ve children \\nare being exclusively breastfed, depriving \\nthem of the best food a baby can get. when \\nit comes to the ‚˜rst foods™ that infants \\nshould start consuming at around the \\nage of 6 months, these too are, in far too \\nmany cases, not meeting children™s needs: \\nless than one in three children worldwide \\nbetween 6 and 23 months are eating \\neating \\nfoods from the minimum number of food \\ngroups\\n that can support their rapidly growing \\nbodies and brains. for the poorest children, \\nthe proportion falls to only one in ˜ve.\\nmaking food systems work for children\\nat current levels, the impact of food \\nproduction on the environment will only \\ngrow, with food demand set to increase \\nby at least half by mid-century.\\n this \\ndemand will have to be satis˜ed against \\nthe backdrop of a world that, after decades \\nof decline, is seeing a slow rise in hunger, \\nwith 820 million people worldwide suffering \\nfrom undernourishment in 2018.  \\nunderstanding how food systems work \\nis essential to improving our diets. but far \\ntoo often, the interests of a very important \\ngroup of people are left out of food systems \\nanalysis œ children. this is a dangerous \\nomission. poor diets have lifelong impacts \\non children™s physical growth and brain \\ndevelopment. that is why they must be \\nat the heart of our thinking about food \\nsystems. if food systems deliver for \\nchildren, they are delivering for us all. \\ngood nutrition can break the \\nintergenerational cycles through which \\nmalnutrition perpetuates poverty, and \\npoverty perpetuates malnutrition. \\nchildren who are well nourished have \\na ˜rm foundation from which they \\ncan develop to their full potential. and \\nwhen children do that, societies and \\neconomies develop better, too. \\nour goal must be to give children diets that are \\nnutritious, safe, affordable\\n and \\nsustainable\\n.more children and \\nyoung people \\n are surviving, \\n but far too few \\n are thriving\\nunicef | east asia and the pacific \\n» 4figure   1  | prevalence of

dutyﬂ to combat the double burden of malnutrition in the philippines \\nthe philippines is a middle-income country with \\npersistent severe inequalities despite high economic \\ngrowth. many children in the philippines are being left \\nbehind, and economic gains do not reach the poorest \\nof the poor. at the same time, the economic growth is \\nbringing rapidly changing diets and food environments, \\nwith sugary beverages, processed foods, snacks and fast \\nfood increasingly available and affordable, even in the \\nremote rural areas. this means that while many filipino \\nchildren are still suffering from undernutrition - stunting \\nand wasting œ increasing numbers of children and their \\nfamilies are also affected by overweight and obesity.\\nthe 2018 expanded national nutrition survey shows \\nthat undernutrition rates remain alarming. stunting \\nis declining too slowly, from 34 per cent in 2003 to \\n30 per cent in 2018, with 3.5 million children under \\n5 affected. just over 5 per cent of children were \\nwasted, but this means 650,000 children are affected, \\n300,000 of them with the severest form that requires \\ntreatment. the philippines has the highest rate of \\nlow birthweight - 1 in 5 children - in the region. data \\nfrom this survey also shows the increasing double \\nburden of malnutrition among children under ˜ve \\nyears, around 460,000 or 4 per cent were overweight. \\noverweight among adolescents was found to be 12 per \\ncent with a steadily increasing trend since 2003. among \\nadult women, over 40 per cent were overweight.\\njoemar bacaltos is the face of the 300,000 filipino \\nchildren with severe wasting. the youngest child of \\npoor and sickly parents, living deep in rural palawan, \\nhe is the perfect example of a child deprived of many of \\nthe rights and opportunities he is entitled to. because of \\nthose deprivations, he became a severely malnourished \\nchild š all skin and bones. joemar was lucky; he received \\nappropriate treatment at the health centre and he fully \\nrecovered. with support from unicef, the philippines \\ndepartment of health has been scaling up services to \\ntreat severely wasted children, enabling frontline workers \\nto have the knowledge and skills they need to detect, treat \\nor refer children like joemar. the filipino public health \\ninsurance scheme is covering the costs of treatment, \\nto ensure that poor children can receive treatment. \\nthe department of health and the national nutrition \\ncouncil of the philippines recognize the strong need \\nto address both undernutrition and overweight \\nand obesity. in fact, overweight and obesity is a \\npriority program of the philippine plan of action on \\nnutrition 2017-2022. the filipino government has \\nalready passed a law to tax sugary beverages, and \\nthe plan also includes other legislative measures \\nlike restricting marketing of unhealthy foods and \\nbeverages to children and putting in place clear \\nfront of pack labels, as well as ensuring healthy \\nschool food environments. in schools, health centres, \\nthe social transfer scheme and communication \\nmessages, ‚double duty™ is the focus of all nutrition \\nefforts: supporting children and their families to \\neat more healthy foods and less unhealthy ones, so \\nthat they have healthy growth and healthy lives.\\n 7  |  the state of the world™s children 2019\\nunicef | east asia and the pacific \\n» 81  |   empower families, children and young people to demand nutritious food\\n demand affects supply as food producers respond to consumers™ behaviours and \\n aspirations. when healthy options are affordable, convenient, and desirable, parents and \\ncaregivers make better food choices for children. as children grow older, knowledge and \\ninformation can make them powerful agents of change. stimulating demand for nutritious \\nfoods means not only educating consumers on the bene˜ts of healthy diets, but also \\n leveraging cultural and social aspirations.\\n2  | drive food suppliers to do the right thing for children\\n demand alone is not enough: healthy food must also be available, affordable, safe, and \\nconvenient. food producers and suppliers have a key role to play, and so do governments, \\nwhich must create a level playing ˜eld for all producers and suppliers, ensuring their actions \\nalign with children™s best interests. food systems are diverse, and so are solutions. but all \\nfood production and consumption must become sustainable if we are to protect children™s \\nnutrition today and tomorrow.\\n3 |  build healthy food environments for all children\\n the personal and external food environments are where children and their caregivers inter\\n-act with the food system. while the forces of supply and demand shape food environments, \\ncontext-appropriate actions such as mandatory front-of-pack labelling and protection \\nagainst exploitative marketing and mandatory labelling can help create food environments \\nconducive to nutritious diets for children.\\n4  | mobilize supportive systems to scale up nutrition results for every child\\nas well as food systems, four other key systems must be mobilized to deliver nutrition \\nservices, improve nutrition practices and achieve nutrition outcomes at scale. the \\nhealth, water and sanitation, education and social protection systems must all deliver \\ninterventions in a coordinated fashion. a systems approach to children's nutrition \\ncan help ensure that children and families have access to healthy diets and that \\nchildren receive the nutrition services they need to develop to their full potential.\\n5  |  collect, analyse and use good-quality data and evidence regularly to \\nguide action and track progress\\n lack of adequate data prevents governments from responding with effective policies, \\nstrategies and programmes. accurate and timely data is needed to understand \\n malnutrition, take coordinated, evidence-based action, and hold all actors accountable. \\ndata collection methods and frequency must be transformed to expand what we \\nknow about the diets and nutrition of children, adolescents and women at every stage \\nof life. data systems must become responsive and develop a culture of data sharing \\nand transparency.\\nthis agenda is driven by two imperatives. first, children have unique nutritional needs and can suffer unique harm from malnu\\n-trition. putting children™s needs ˜rst is key to ensuring that every child and young person has the nutrition they need to get the \\nbest start in life. second, all children and young people will need nutritious, affordable and sustainable diets if societies are to \\nmeet the economic, social and environmental challenges of our changing world in the 21st century.\\nfor every child to grow well1 in 3 children  is not growing well1empower families, children and young people to demand

their full \\npotential. together, \\nwe helped create new \\nopportunities and \\nplaced dreams and \\naspirations within \\nreach.\\nthere were many successes to celebrate. \\nin more than 190 countries and territories, unicef and partners helped \\nchildren survive, thrive and go to school ready to learn and make the most \\nof their opportunities. unicef engaged with partners around the globe to \\nprotect children, ensure safe environments, reduce poverty, address harmful \\ngender norms and ˜ght against discrimination.in emergency situations, children and families received mental health care and \\npsychosocial support, along with the basics of nutrition, education and health \\ncare. migrant and refugee children were provided with protective services. \\nand in 2019, the world celebrated the 30th anniversary of the convention \\non the rights of the child while at the start of 2020, we marked the 25th \\nanniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action

grappling with covid-19, a global \\npandemic that is taking the lives of many thousands and upending homes \\nand schools for children everywhere, threatening their well-being and future. \\nunicef

results \\nthis annual report comes at a time when unicef hits the mid-term mark of \\nits strategic plan. combined with the annual review, the mid-term review of \\nresults highlighted clear progress on many child-related sdg targets. and \\nacross the united nations system, agencies continue to share lessons learned, \\ncoordinate action and collaborate to accelerate results toward the sdgs. \\nhowever, the review also noted that progress on some targets must be \\naccelerated if the sdgs and strategic plan goals are to be realized. this is \\nparticularly true in fragile contexts where the scale of needs is high and \\ntrends in progress are of great concern. \\nby 2019, 74 per cent of the targets set out in the unicef strategic plan \\nwere achieved.  however, despite a strong performance by unicef in \\nmany of the sdg areas, progress remained too slow in others, with 26 per \\ncent of the targets off-track. at the current pace, for example, sdg targets \\nwill not be achieved for many critical issues including: immunization, health, \\nnutrition, hiv and aids and early childhood development. in addition, \\nprogress is slow for targets relating to: \\n  access\\n to quality education \\n  birth registration and violence against children \\n  safely managed water and sanitation \\n  disaster risk reduction and climate-change \\n  child poverty \\nmore than 21

sector is one key partner that \\nunicef has worked closely with over the years to conceptualize, produce and deliver supplies \\nœ creating shared value for children, together. this report highlights many examples of where \\nengagement with the business sector has contributed to the health, safety and well-being of \\nchildren and their families. \\nshared value can derive from different engagement modalities, such as philanthropic and \\ncorporate social responsibility, market shaping, product innovation and strategic procurement. \\nfor unicef, creating shared value means maximizing impact for children and their families. \\nfor businesses, this approach also provides a portal for entering new markets, supporting local \\neconomies and fostering sustainability. \\nin 2018, unicef procured $3.486 billion worth of goods and services from over 11,000 businesses. \\nbehind these ˚gures are an array of strategies employed to achieve shared value for children. \\nfor example, by analysing and publicly sharing market information, unicef fosters competition, \\npromotes fair pricing and in˜uences investments. unicef also engages directly with businesses \\nand governments to improve supply chains so that supplies of assured quality reach children \\nwhere and when they need them. \\nwhile the report highlights many of these achievements, it also draws attention to the \\nopportunities where further value can be created for children and young people. together, we can \\ndo more to:  \\nstrengthen our collaborations. \\neach year unicef convenes industry consultations in areas such \\nas vaccines, medicines, sanitation and nutritional products. in 2018 unicef convened 11 forums, \\nbringing together nearly 1000 participants from governments, suppliers and other partners. these \\nplatforms provide a critical opportunity to discuss strategic directions and alignment and better \\nunderstand industry challenges and market perspectives, with the common goal of achieving \\nresults for children. \\nembark on new innovations. \\nover the years, collective efforts have achieved much progress in \\nsafeguarding the health and well-being of children. yet there are many areas where gaps remain. \\nunicef and partners are working to identify, develop and, most importantly, scale new products \\ntargeting areas of unmet need for children. for instance, unicef worked with suppliers to modify \\nthe design of latrines used during emergencies so that they are accessible for children with \\nimpaired mobility.   \\nfoster healthy markets. \\nthe development of a product is not enough œ a sustainable market \\nmust also be in place for that product to reach children. unicef works with partners to optimize \\nmarkets for existing products, and shape markets for new ones. for example, unicef is \\nmobilizing stakeholders to address the sustainable development goal of ending open defecation \\nby 2030. together, we hope to catalyse change in local markets to promote self-sustaining supply \\nand demand chains for household toilets and sanitation services. \\nas the world celebrates the 30\\nth anniversary of the\\n convention on the rights of the child\\n, this is \\na critical moment for unicef to further leverage the strengths and capacities of business as a \\nchange agent for children. through innovative thinking, hard work and close engagement, these \\ncollaborations will continue to drive results for every child.\\netleva kadilli\\n, director, unicef supply division\\ncreating shared value\\ntotul,

should be \\nat least 95 per cent and involve \\ntwo doses of measles-containing \\nvaccine. but as populations \\nbene˚t from immunization, \\nthe incidence of a disease \\nbecomes rarer and people may forget that it remains a threat. \\nthe subsequent uncertainty \\nin demand can be challenging \\nfor countries trying to forecast necessary stock levels for their \\nprogrammes. uncertainty in

\\nand logistics system\\nin response to a massive displacement of \\nrohingya refugees from myanmar to bangladesh \\nin 2017œ2018, unicef quickly set up an \\nemergency logistics and supply chain to ensure \\nthat supplies reached children and their families.\\nwhen thousands of people \\nbegan crossing the border \\nfrom myanmar daily, unicef \\nresponded rapidly to set up a \\nsystem to deliver supplies to \\nchildren and their families in the \\naffected areas. \\na large warehouse was needed \\nto receive the hundreds of \\ntonnes of aid arriving by sea \\nand air. there, the supplies \\ncould be divided into smaller \\nloads for onward distribution. a \\nwarehouse facility was identi˚ed \\nin chittagong œ the nearest large \\nbangladeshi city, ˚ve hours™ \\ndrive from the refugee camps \\nof cox™s bazar. a wide range of \\nvehicles were used, including \\ntuk-tuks, the three-wheeled \\nrickshaws commonly driven \\nthroughout asia.\\na crucial element of the \\noperation™s success was \\nclose coordination with the \\ngovernment of bangladesh \\nto meet the speci˚c needs of \\nvulnerable children. for example, \\ndiseases can spread rapidly in the \\ncon˚nes of a crowded refugee \\ncamp. to address the pressing \\nemergency in the camps, the \\ngovernment exceptionally \\nreallocated vaccines from \\nits routine immunization \\nprogrammes. unicef then took \\naction to replenish this stock with \\nfunding from gavi, the vaccine \\nalliance, quickly delivering extra \\nvaccines so that bangladesh™s \\nroutine immunization programme \\nwould not be disrupted.\\nin addition to the 9.1 million \\nvaccines and many other life-\\nsaving products, in 2018, unicef \\nprocured 862,700 education kits, \\nincluding school-in-a-box kits \\nto ensure children™s continued \\naccess to learning. by the end \\nof the year, more than 70 per \\ncent of the children in the camps \\nwere regularly attending classes. \\nthe types of supplies distributed \\nalso depended on changing \\nconditions on the ground. for \\ninstance, during the winter \\nmonths, unicef distributed \\nwinter clothing and blankets to \\nchildren and their mothers. \\ntowards the end of 2018 annual \\nheavy monsoon rains were expected to cause transport \\ndelays as roads became impassable or damaged. \\nflooding would also increase the \\nrisk of the spread of waterborne \\nbacteria and diseases. in \\nanticipation of this, a wide \\nrange of extra items were pre-\\npositioned in the local warehouse \\nœ such as water puri˚cation \\ntablets, hygiene kits, school \\nequipment and nutrition supplies.\\nthrough pre-positioning, \\nrapid response and a range of proactive interventions, a \\nfunctional and ef˚cient supply \\nand logistics system was \\nestablished and maintained. \\nunicef was thus able to ensure \\nthat refugee children and families \\nreceived the supplies they \\nneeded. as examples, by the end \\nof 2018, over 380,000 rohingya \\nrefugees

of affordable \\nsupplies for every child.\\nin 2017 unicef projected \\n$690 million in price savings \\nfor strategic supplies over the \\nperiod 2018œ2021, and achieved \\nsavings of $351.2 million in 2018 \\nalone. these projections and \\nthe 2018 ˚gure are lower than \\nthose achieved in the period \\n2012œ2017. over the previous \\nyears, unicef worked with \\nsuppliers to realize signi˚cant \\nprice reductions, particularly \\non childhood vaccines. prices \\nwere brought to more affordable levels and products made more available by working together to \\nshape some of these strategic \\nproduct markets. today, unicef \\nis increasingly shifting its focus \\nfrom price savings to a more holistic procurement impact. this \\nwill consider both savings and \\nother value elements such as \\nsocial and environmental impact, \\nwith the objective of ensuring \\nsustained availability and \\naccessibility of strategic supplies \\nfor children.in 2018, unicef collaborated \\nwith 12 other united nations \\nagencies to identify leading \\npractices in de˚ning and \\nquantifying procurement \\nimpact, and to agree on a shared \\napproach across agencies. this \\napproach is expected to enable \\nunicef to measure œ beyond price considerations œ its ability \\nto harness the power of markets \\nand reduce market barriers that \\nprevent children from accessing essential
