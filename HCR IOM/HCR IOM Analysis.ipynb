It is the largest \\n\\nexodus in the region™s recent history and one of the \\n\\nbiggest displacement crises in the world. More than \\n\\n900,000 Venezuelans have sought asylum in the last \\n\\nthree years, including 430,000 in 2019 alone. Some \\n\\ncountries in the region, such as Brazil, have taken steps \\n\\nto apply the extended refugee de˚nition under the \\n\\n1984 Cartagena Declaration on Refugees and national \\n\\nlegislation, while other countries have gradually scaled \\n\\nup their capacity to process asylum claims and are \\n\\ndeveloping simpli˚ed or accelerated refugee status \\n\\ndetermination case processing modalities. In addition, \\n\\nLatin American countries granted over 2.4 million \\n\\nresidence permits and other forms of legal stay to \\n\\nVenezuelans by the end of 2019, which allow them to \\n\\naccess some basic services. New visa requirements in \\n\\nmany States along the Andean Corridor have left those \\n\\non the move facing increased protection risks. \\n\\nFurthermore, the number of Venezuelans in an irregular \\n\\nsituation continues to increase. At the end of 2019, over \\n\\n50 per cent of Venezuelan refugees and migrants in \\n\\nColombia were in an irregular situation. Based on \\n\\nreports received by UNHCR and its partners, as well as \\n\\nreliable information in the public domain from a wide \\n\\nrange of sources about the situation in Venezuela, \\n\\nprotection-sensitive arrangements are required, in \\n\\nparticular protection against forced returns and access \\nto basic services, and are thus promoted for all \\nVenezuelans displaced abroad Œ irrespective of their \\n\\nstatus Œ to reinforce the protection dimension and \\n\\nconsistent responses across the region.\\n12 With the objective of ensuring an accountable, \\n\\ncoherent, coordinated and protection-sensitive \\n\\noperational response for refugees and migrants from \\n\\nVenezuela across the region, UNHCR and the \\n\\nInternational Organization for Migration (IOM) lead the \\n\\nRegional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform (R4V).\\n13  \\nIn 2019, through its Regional Refugee and Migrant \\n\\nResponse Plan (RMRP), partners™ activities bene˚ted \\n\\nover 1.6 million people in 16 countries.

This agreement \\n\\nhost up to 30,000 vulnerable people at risk \\n\\nand stranded in Libya. Under the memorandum \\nof understanding, UNHCR in partnership with \\nthe Government of Rwanda and the AU has \\n\\nestablished an Emergency Transit Mechanism \\n\\n(ETM), to facilitate the relocation of up to 500 \\npeople of concern at any given time from the \\nconˆict zones in Libya to safety in Rwanda, \\nwhile continuing to seek durable solutions \\noptions in and outside the country. The ETM \\n\\nin Rwanda complements the Emergency \\nEvacuation Transit Mechanism established in \\n\\nNiger in 2017. \\nCan we predict forced \\ndisplacement for the next \\n \\n10 years?\\nIt is very dicult to predict global forced \\ndisplacement, or its impact on the 2030 Agenda \\n\\nfor Sustainable Development. Such predictions \\n\\ntypically rely on historical population trends and \\n\\nanticipate future events, which is sometimes \\n\\nimpossible. Based on the displacement trajectory \\n\\nin the 1990s and 2000s, few people could have \\n\\nforeseen the rapidly growing number of displaced \\n\\npeople we have seen over the last decade.\\nFrom the mid-1990s until around 2010, the \\nnumber of displaced people remained relatively \\nstable because even though new displacement \\n\\ncontinued, at the same time many displaced \\n\\npeople eventually repatriated, built permanent \\n\\nhomes in their host communities or resettled \\n\\nin third countries. In the aftermath of the early \\n\\nBalkan wars and the Rwandan genocide, for \\n\\nexample, global displacement ˚gures remained \\n\\nwell below 40 million, and as low as 34 million in \\n\\n1997, according to estimates. Between 2000 and \\n\\n2009, the numbers of displaced generally ranged \\n\\nbetween 37 and 42 million. \\nThe last decade, however, brought a major shift. \\nMore people sought refuge, but those who had \\nbeen displaced had fewer options for rebuilding \\ntheir lives. As wars and conˆicts dragged on, \\n\\nfewer refugees and internally displaced people \\n\\nwere able to return home, countries accepted a \\n\\nlimited number of refugees for resettlement and \\n\\nhost countries struggled to integrate displaced \\n\\npopulations. For instance, only 3.9 million \\nCHAPTER 1CHAPTER 1˜˜˚˛˝˚˜˙˚˜˙˚˛ˆ˚˜ˆ˚˛ˇ˚˜˝˜\\n˝˛\\n˝˘˘˜\\n˝˘˘˛\\n˙˜˜˜\\n˙˜˜˛\\n˙˜˝˜\\n˙˜˝˛˙˜˝˘\\nFigure 4\\n   |  Refugee returns by decade\\n11refugees were able to return to their country of \\norigin between 2010 and 2019. This compares to \\n\\nalmost 10 million refugees who returned home \\n\\nduring the previous decade and more than 15 \\n\\nmillion two decades prior (see \\nFˇ˘\\n). With \\nmore people becoming displaced and fewer \\n\\nbeing able to return, an increasing number \\n\\n˚nd themselves in protracted and long-lasting \\n\\ndisplacement situations. The world has clearly \\n\\nshifted from a decade of solutions to a decade of \\n\\nnew and protracted displacement. \\nClimate change and natural disasters can \\nexacerbate threats that force people to ˆee within \\n\\ntheir country or across international borders. \\n\\nThe interplay between climate, conˆict, hunger, \\n\\npoverty and persecution creates increasingly \\n\\ncomplex emergencies. For example, food \\n\\ninsecurity may become a major driver of conˆicts \\n\\nand displacement. An international alliance of \\n\\nthe United Nations, governmental and non-\\n\\ngovernmental agencies working to address \\n\\nthe root causes of extreme hunger reported \\n\\nthat conˆict, weather extremes and economic \\n\\nturbulence contributed to several disturbing \\n\\ntrends. The group reported that at the end of \\n\\n2019, 135 million people across 55 countries and \\n\\nterritories experienced acute food insecurity.\\n15 In \\naddition, 75 million children had stunted growth \\n\\nand 17 million suered from wasting.

For \\n\\ninstance, the number of asylum applications \\n\\nregistered in the European Union in March 2020 \\n\\ndropped by 43 per cent compared to February \\n\\nas asylum systems slowed or came to a halt with \\n\\ncountries closing borders or implementing strict \\n\\nborder restrictions in response to COVID-19.\\n16 In other parts of the world, refugee registration, \\n\\nan essential protection activity at the core of \\n\\nrefugee statistics,\\n17\\n also dropped signi˚cantly \\ndespite eorts by some countries to resort to \\n\\nremote registration and documentation. As \\n\\na result, global refugee and asylum statistics \\n\\nmay under-represent the true magnitude of \\n\\nthe number of people seeking international \\n\\nprotection during the pandemic. This could \\n\\nincrease the uncertainty for predicting global \\n\\nforced displacement in the future.\\nWhatever the predictions are for future global \\ndisplacement, we must reverse the current \\n\\ntrend and massively expand pathways for the \\n\\nforcibly displaced to rebuild their lives \\n  \\nŒ whether \\nin their home countries, in third countries or in \\n\\ntheir host communities. In 2019, UNHCR and its \\n\\npartners launched the \\nThree-Year Strategy on \\n\\nResettlement and Complementary Pathways\\n.18 The strategy foresees resettlement of one million \\n\\nrefugees and admission of two million refugees \\n\\nthrough complementary pathways such as family \\n\\nreuni˚cation or labour mobility schemes by 2028. \\n\\nFor it to succeed, States need to oer more \\n\\navenues to solutions for refugees in line with the \\n\\nobjective of greater shared responsibility set out \\n\\nin the Global Compact on Refugees.\\n16 See \\nhttps://easo.europa.eu/news-events/covid-19-asylum-\\napplications-down-march\\n17 See Chapter 7 for more details on sources and basis of refugee \\nstatistics.\\n18 To work towards increasing the number of resettlement places and \\nadmissions, as well as expanding the number of countries offering \\nthese programmes, the Three-Year Strategy on Resettlement and \\n\\nComplementary Pathways was launched in 2019 by governments, \\n\\nnon-governmental organizations, civil society and UNHCR. The \\n\\nstrategy™s target of 60,000 resettlement departures to 29 States \\n\\nin 2019 has been achieved.

The Middle East, North Africa \\n\\nand Europe all felt the impact of the war in Syria, \\n\\nwhich left 6.6 million people living in displacement \\n\\nat the end of 2019. The majority were hosted in \\n\\nTurkey (3.6 million), Lebanon (910,600) and Jordan \\n\\n(654,700). The rising number of refugees in the \\n\\nMiddle East and North Africa was partly oset by \\n\\na drop in the number of Iraqi refugees (from 1.6 \\n\\nmillion to 63,000), many of whom were forced to \\n\\nˆee the conˆict in Syria and return to Iraq or seek \\n\\nprotection in other countries further a˚eld.\\nIn Europe, the outbreak of large-scale armed \\nconˆict in eastern Ukraine in 2014 led to a large \\n\\noutˆow of refugees in the region. At the end of \\n\\n2019, there were 60,000 Ukrainian refugees \\n\\nworldwide. \\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, the number of refugees \\nresiding across the region nearly tripled in the \\n\\ncourse of the decade, increasing from 2.2 to 6.3 \\n\\nmillion. Conˆict and violence in South Sudan, \\n\\nthe DRC, Central African Republic, Somalia and \\nBurundi forced millions of people to ˆee, but other \\n\\ncrises contributed to the rise in refugees as well. \\nIn the Americas, there was a fourfold increase in \\nthe number of people displaced across borders \\n\\nduring the decade, primarily due to the exodus \\n\\nfrom Venezuela, and the inclusion of 3.6 million \\n\\nVenezuelans displaced abroad in the 2019 global \\n\\ndisplacement statistics. In addition, hundreds of \\n\\nthousands of Central Americans ˆed deteriorating \\n\\nsecurity conditions and violence and sought \\n\\nshelter across the region.\\nThe Asia and Paci˚c region experienced a \\nthree per cent overall increase in the number \\n\\nof refugees over the decade, mostly due to the \\n\\noutˆow of 700,000 stateless refugees from \\n\\nMyanmar to Bangladesh beginning in August 2017. \\n\\nWhile the increase has been limited, the overall \\n\\n˚gures reˆect the protracted plight of Afghan \\n\\nrefugees in Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of \\n\\nIran, which has lasted for more than 40 years. \\n\\nVoluntary repatriation to Afghanistan continued \\n\\nthrough the decade, but at low levels.\\n˜˚˜˛˝˜˛˚˜˙˝˜˙˚˙˝˛˝˙˝˛˛˙˝˛˙˙˝˛ˆ˙˝˛ˇ˙˝˛˚˙˝˛˘˙˝˛˙˝˛\\n18CHAPTER 2Table 1\\n   |  Refugees, people in refugee-like situations and Venezuelans displaced abroad by \\nUNHCR regions \\n |  2019\\nUNHCR regionsStart-2019\\nEnd-2019Change (total)Refugees\\nPeople in \\nrefugee-like \\nsituationsVenezuelans \\ndisplaced \\nabroadTotalRefugees\\nPeople in \\nrefugee-like \\nsituationsVenezuelans \\ndisplaced \\nabroadTotalAbsolute%\\n- East and Horn of Africa and \\n\\nGreat Lakes\\n4,388,9003,700\\n-   4,392,6004,388,700\\n-   -   4,388,700-3,900-0.1%\\n- Southern Africa\\n777,500-\\n-   777,500755,300\\n-   -   755,300-22,200-2.9%\\n- West and \\n\\nCentral Africa\\n1,164,100-\\n-   1,164,1001,204,700\\n-   -   1,204,70040,6003.5%\\nTotal Africa*\\n6,330,5003,700\\n-   6,334,2006,348,700\\n-   -   6,348,70014,5000.2%\\nAmericas534,800108,8002,606,5003,250,100592,800108,8003,582,2004,283,8001,033,70031.8%\\nAsia and Paci˚c\\n4,141,60054,600\\n-   4,196,2004,133,70048,700\\n-   4,182,400-13,800-0.3%\\nEurope6,402,50028,100\\n-   6,430,6006,543,50027,000\\n-   6,570,500139,9002.2%\\nMiddle East and \\nNorth Africa\\n2,649,80042,900\\n-   2,692,7002,602,40040,300\\n-   2,642,700-50,000-1.9%\\nTotal\\n20,059,200\\n238,1002,606,500\\n22,903,80020,221,100\\n224,8003,582,20024,028,1001,124,3004.9%\\n*Excluding North Africa.\\nDemographics of people \\ndisplaced across borders\\nThe demographic structure of the people \\ndisplaced across borders diers from the \\n\\npopulation of the 272 million international \\n\\nmigrants\\n24 and the 7.7 billion world population.\\n25 Children represent a larger proportion of \\n\\nthe displaced population than they do in the \\n\\ninternational migrant population, for example. \\n At the end of 2019, around half of refugees \\n\\nwere children,\\n26 compared to an estimated 31 \\nper cent of the world population and just 10 per \\n\\ncent of the international migrant population.\\n27 Refugee children face particular challenges, \\n24 The international migrant dataset includes refugees and asylum-seekers in specific countries.

At the end of 2019, there \\n\\nwere 6.6 million Syrian refugees hosted by 126 \\n\\ncountries worldwide. The vast majority (83%) \\n\\nremained in neighbouring countries or in the region. \\n\\nTurkey continued to host the largest number of \\n\\nSyrian refugees (3.6 million), followed by Lebanon \\n\\n(910,600), Jordan (654,700), Iraq (245,800) and \\n\\nEgypt (129,200).

At times, the \\n\\nnumber exceeded six million. During the last \\n\\ndecade, it dropped by 11 per cent from some \\n\\n3.1 million to 2.7 million, primarily due to an \\n\\nincrease in returns to Afghanistan from Pakistan \\n\\nand the Islamic Republic of Iran and veri˚cation \\n\\nexercises\\n29 conducted in Pakistan.

Comparing the \\n\\nnumber of people displaced across borders to \\n\\nnational income levels according to World Bank \\n\\nclassi˚cation,\\n34 it is clear that in the last decade, \\nhigh-income countries never hosted more than \\n\\n19 per cent of this population. In 2019, they \\n\\nhosted 17 per cent. Low-income countries, on the \\n\\nother hand, consistently hosted around 20 per \\n\\ncent per year.\\nIn 2010, upper-middle income countries Œ \\nincluding Turkey, Colombia, the Islamic Republic \\n34\\n Income groupings are from the World Bank: \\nhttp://databank.\\nworldbank.org/data/download/site-content/OGHIST.xls \\nof Iran, Lebanon and Jordan Œ hosted 16 per cent \\nof refugees.

The intensifying \\n\\nconˆict led to almost half a million people being \\n\\nnewly displaced during the year. \\nWidespread conˆict and violence in the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo led to ˚ve \\n\\nmillion people being internally displaced by year-\\n\\nend, the highest number reported by UNHCR to \\n\\ndate. Other countries with major IDP populations \\n\\nat the end of 2019 were Yemen (3.6 million), \\n\\nSomalia (2.6 million), Afghanistan (2.6 million) and \\n\\nNigeria (2.2 million). \\nProtection and solutions for \\nIDPs\\nProtection remained the most fundamental \\nchallenge. The outbreak of war in Syria in 2011 \\n\\ngenerated one of the largest displacement \\n\\ncrises in recent history. Conˆicts which occurred \\n\\nafter the ‚Arab Spring™ in Libya, Yemen and \\n\\nelsewhere created massive protection needs \\n\\nand displacement that have lasted throughout \\n\\nthe decade.

At the same time, the refugee crisis \\n\\nin Europe in 2015 and decreases in the internally \\n\\ndisplaced population in Syria around the same time \\n\\nwere reminders of the continuum between internal \\n\\ndisplacement and refugee outˆows. The protection \\n\\nof displaced people and those aected by conˆict \\n\\nbecame paramount as escalating and renewed \\n\\nconˆict also aected the Ukraine, the Democratic \\n\\nRepublic of the Congo, South Sudan, the Central \\n\\nAfrican Republic, Mali and Nigeria, with UNHCR \\n\\nengaged in operational response and coordination \\n\\nleadership. The conˆict in Iraq, including the fall \\n\\nof Mosul, led to large-scale displacement and \\n\\nacute protection needs, particularly for ethnic \\n\\nand religious minorities, such as the Yazidis and \\n\\npresented challenges of a massive scale.  \\nIn some countries, large-scale displacement \\nwas oset by a relatively large number of IDPs \\n\\nreturning to their places of origin. In countries \\n\\nwhere UNHCR was operationally active, an \\n\\nestimated 31 million or more internally displaced \\n\\npersons were able to return or ˚nd a solution \\n\\nduring the decade, although many more continued \\n\\nto live in protracted displacement. The largest IDP \\n\\nreturn movements between 2010 and 2019 took \\n\\nplace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \\n\\n(DRC) and Iraq, presenting some of the largest \\n\\nUNHCR operations globally. In the DRC, more \\n\\nthan six million people returned to their place \\n\\nof residence, one third of them during 2018 and \\n\\n2019. In Iraq, more than ˚ve million IDPs returned \\n\\nto their place of residence during the decade, \\n\\nsome 85 per cent of them in the past four years. \\nWorking on solutions for IDPs required increasing \\ncollaboration with development partners, such as \\n\\nthe UN Development Programme and the World \\n\\nBank in countries such as Colombia and Sudan, \\n\\nand with peacebuilding actors as UNHCR was \\n\\ndesignated the focal point within the Secretary-\\n\\nGeneral™s Framework on Ending Displacement in \\n\\nthe Aftermath of Conˆict.\\n43 Nevertheless, more \\nneeds to be done to build on these partnerships \\n43 UN Secretary-General (UNSG), Decision No.2011/20 - Durable \\nSolutions: Follow up to the Secretary-General™s 2009 report on \\npeacebuilding, 4 October 2011, available at: \\nhttps://www.refworld.\\n\\norg/docid/5242d12b7.html\\nbetween humanitarian, development and \\npeacebuilding actors and to live up to the pledge \\n\\nin the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \\n\\nto ‚leave no one behind™, including IDPs.\\nThroughout the decade, UNHCR worked to ˚nd \\nsolutions for IDPs, building upon its experience in \\n\\nfacilitating solutions for refugees and within the \\n\\nIASC Framework on Durable Solutions for IDPs,\\n44 introduced in 2010. In some countries, such as \\n\\nUganda, returns brought to a close displacement \\n\\nthat had peaked years before in 2005 Œ 2006. \\n\\nIn Libya, Mali and South Sudan, returns occurred \\n\\nmore quickly as changing conˆict dynamics made it \\n\\npossible for some to return home, albeit sometimes \\n\\nin adverse conditions. In Yemen, UNHCR worked \\n\\nwith authorities to help thousands to return in 2012, \\n\\npaving the way for the approval in 2013 of a national \\n\\npolicy on IDPs. In Somalia, UNHCR worked through \\n\\nthe decade to provide a solutions framework, and \\n\\nthis led to displacement solutions being included in \\n\\nNational Development Plans and the establishment \\n\\nof relevant governance structures.\\nIn a major breakthrough for the protection of \\nIDPs in Africa, the African Union Convention on \\n\\nthe Protection of and Assistance to Internally \\n\\nDisplaced Persons in Africa (known as the \\n\\nKampala Convention) became eective in 2012. \\n\\nWith new and protracted displacement in Africa \\n\\nconstituting an estimated 43 per cent of global \\n\\nconˆict-related internal displacement at the end \\n\\nof 2019,\\n45 there is an evident and critical need \\nfor national legislation, policies and measures to \\n\\nimplement the Kampala Convention. In the last \\n\\ndecade, 30 members have become party to the \\n\\nKampala Convention and seven have adopted \\n\\nrelevant implementing legislation and policies. \\n\\nAlong with its partners, UNHCR is promoting \\n\\nfurther rati˚cations and assisting Governments in \\n\\nAfrica to domesticate the Convention, and those \\n\\noutside Africa to develop laws and policies on \\n\\ninternal displacement. Since the development of \\n\\nthe Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement \\n\\nin 1998, more than 88 national laws and policies \\n\\non internal displacement have been adopted, \\n\\naccording to a global database maintained by \\n\\nUNHCR as part of the Global Protection Cluster.\\n44 See \\nhttps://interagencystandingcommittee.org/system/files/\\niasc_framework_on_durable_solutions_for_idps_april_2010.pdf\\n45 Source: \\ninternal-displacement.org\\n 32CHAPTER 3The urbanization of internal \\ndisplacement\\nDisplacement in and to urban areas continued \\nthroughout the decade. The limited geographic \\n\\ninformation available con˚rms that IDPs were \\n\\npredominantly located in rural areas at the start of \\n\\nthe decade. By the end of the decade, the trend \\n\\nhad reversed. Available data on IDPs indicates \\n\\nthat the ratio of urban versus non-urban internally \\n\\ndisplaced populations was 2:1 at the end of 2019. \\n\\nIn other words, where UNHCR was involved in \\n\\nsituations of internal displacement in 2019, two out \\n\\nof three IDPs were in urban or semi-urban areas.\\nFrom Mosul, Iraq to Mogadishu, Somalia\\n, internal \\ndisplacement was increasingly happening among \\nurban populations in cities rather than in camps. \\n\\nIn countries with ongoing conˆict in urban areas \\n\\nŒ such as in Aleppo, Syria or Bangui, Central \\n\\nAfrican Republic Œ protecting civilians was a major \\n\\nchallenge. In addition, IDPs in urban environments \\n\\nare often dispersed and struggle to ˚nd \\n\\naccommodation, staying in collective centres and \\npublic buildings. Rapid urbanization has increased \\nprotection risks posed by overcrowded or \\n\\nsubstandard living conditions, particularly where \\n\\nIDPs are forced to live in informal settlements, \\n\\namong the urban poor, or where access to safe \\n\\nwater and sanitation is limited. Security of tenure \\n\\nand risk of evictions are also greater in urban \\n\\nsettings, often resulting in further displacement. \\n\\nMaintaining livelihoods is also a struggle for \\n\\ndisplaced people, due to many reasons, such as \\n\\nundeveloped local economies, job competition or \\n\\nthe need for a new skill set.\\nEngagement in disaster \\nsituations \\nIn 2010, the High Commissioner™s Dialogue \\non Protection Gaps and Responses noted that \\n\\ndisasters and climate change could be a driver of \\n\\ndisplacement. Over the following decade, UNHCR \\n\\ncontinued to engage with people displaced \\n\\ninternally by disasters and climate, in more than 25 \\n\\noperations. These included a limited role following \\n\\nthe earthquake in Haiti, response to ˆoods in \\nUKRAINE\\n. ﬁI feel like the con˜ict is \\nendless, Maryna* explains as she \\nstands on the balcony of her \\n\\napartment block in Svitlodarsk, \\n\\nDonetsk.

Speci˚c protection \\n\\nconsiderations, such as safeguarding from \\n\\ngender-based violence, abuse or exploitation \\n\\nof children, and issues of inclusion remained \\n\\nkey due to the demographics of internal \\n\\ndisplacement.

In Afghanistan, the \\n\\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia and \\n\\nBurkina Faso, for instance, children constituted \\n\\nmore than 60 per cent of IDPs at the end of 2019. \\n\\nIn the Central African Republic, Chad, Niger, \\n\\nPakistan and Yemen, their proportion ranged \\n\\nbetween 53 and 57 per cent. Comparing these \\n\\n˚gures to IDP situations in Afghanistan, the \\n\\nCentral African Republic and Somalia in 2010, \\n\\nthe proportion of children increased by a few \\n\\npercentage points. \\nInsucient data on persons with disabilities still \\nhinders a better understanding of the risks they \\n\\nface in displacement, although population surveys \\n\\nreveal that the prevalence and negative impacts of \\n\\nliving with a disability are more pervasive in crisis-\\n\\naected countries, such as Syria, where 27 per \\n\\ncent of the total population above 12 years of age \\n\\nhave a disability.\\n47UNHCR and the future of \\ninternal displacement \\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \\nand its commitment to ‚leave no one behind™ \\n\\nprovide a powerful basis for the inclusion \\n\\nof internally displaced people in economic \\n\\ndevelopment planning, as well as in all other \\n\\nmeasures taken by States to achieve the \\n\\nSustainable Development Goals.\\nAt the World Humanitarian Summit held in May \\n2016, far-reaching commitments were made, \\n\\nincluding an ambitious target of reducing \\n\\nthe number of people in protracted or new \\n\\ndisplacement by 50 per cent by the year 2030. \\n47 https://www.globalprotectioncluster.org/wp-content/uploads/\\nDisability_Prevalence-and-Impact_FINAL-2.pdf \\nOver the course of the upcoming decade, UNHCR \\n\\nwill continue to work with national governments \\n\\nin supporting eorts by States to adopt inclusive \\n\\npolicies that better integrate internally displaced \\n\\npeople into society and social safety nets; \\n\\nrecognize them as socio-economic assets and \\n\\ncontributors (including through better data); and \\n\\nstrengthen the laws that ensure their protection \\n\\nand human rights.  \\nIn 2019, UNHCR released an updated IDP Policy, \\nwhich recommitted UNHCR to be a predictable \\n\\nand eective stakeholder in situations of internal \\n\\ndisplacement both operationally and within \\n\\ninter-agency response mechanisms, in support \\n\\nof aected States and communities.

Therefore, supporting \\n\\nthe assumption of State responsibility for RSD \\n\\nremained a top priority for UNHCR during the last \\n\\ndecade. Despite some successes, many States \\n\\nhave yet to establish national RSD systems or \\n\\nhave systems that are not fully accessible. In \\n\\nsuch situations, UNHCR may conduct RSD under \\n\\nits mandate, either in the absence of a national \\n\\nsystem or, more rarely, in parallel with one. In \\n\\nsome countries, UNHCR conducts RSD jointly with \\n\\nthe government.   \\nIn the last decade, the number of States and \\nterritories implementing national asylum \\n\\nprocedures rose from 108 in 2010 to 116 in 2019. \\n\\nSome of the States that hosted the largest number \\n\\nof refugees implemented State asylum procedures \\n\\nduring this period, including Kenya and, more \\n\\nrecently, Turkey. This welcome assumption of \\n\\nresponsibility by States is also evident in the \\n\\nproportion of the world™s individual applications \\n\\nfor refugee status received by UNHCR. In 2010, \\n\\nUNHCR received 11 per cent of the world™s \\n\\nindividual applications for refugee status and in \\n\\n2013, 19 per cent. By 2019, the percentage fell to \\n\\n˚ve per cent.\\nAlthough these trends are encouraging, the \\nnumber of States in which UNHCR conducted \\n\\nRSD continued to remain stable (with some yearly \\n\\nvariation). In 2019, UNHCR was registering new \\n\\nasylum-seekers in the same number of countries, \\n\\n53, as it had in 2010. This could be explained in \\n\\npart by RSD applications made in small (often \\n\\nisland) countries that rarely received asylum \\n\\napplications. But UNHCR also continued to conduct \\n\\nRSD in countries with national asylum systems \\n\\ncharacterized by persistent protection gaps. \\nThere is reason to be optimistic that in the coming \\nyears more States will assume responsibility for \\n\\nRSD and/or improve their asylum systems as the \\n\\nglobal community works to implement the GCR. \\n\\nAt the ˚rst Global Refugee Forum, over 55 States \\n\\nmade pledges either to improve their own asylum \\n\\nsystems or to support other national systems, \\n\\nincluding in some instances through the ACSG \\n\\nwhich was ocially launched at the Forum. A large \\n\\nnumber of civil society organizations and other \\n\\nactors pledged to support this process, including \\n\\nthrough advocacy for using the ACSG mechanism.\\nIncreasing e˜ciency and \\nfairness in RSD procedures \\nAs the number of asylum applications made in \\nthe last decade continued to rise Œ due to new \\n\\nand ongoing displacement situations in Syria, \\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˘ˇ\\n\\n\\n43CHAPTER 4Venezuela, Afghanistan, Iraq and other places Œ \\nensuring eient status determination processes \\nbecame critical. The number of individual RSD \\n\\napplications (including appeal and reopened \\n\\napplications) rose from 850,300 in 2010 to \\n\\n2.3 million in 2019. In 2019, close to 1.3 million \\n\\nsubstantive decisions were made globally. But \\n\\ndespite investments by States and UNHCR in \\n\\ndecision-making capacity, the end of 2019 saw more \\n\\nthan 4.1 million cases pending (350,400 in UNHCR \\n\\nmandate RSD procedures, 1,900 in joint procedures \\n\\nand 3.8 million in government procedures). \\nThe number of new applications made to \\nUNHCR also increased throughout the decade, \\n\\nfrom 96,800 in 2010 to 227,800 in 2018, with \\n\\nUNHCR conducting the most RSD in Turkey. \\n\\nIn 2019, the number dropped to 120,400 \\n\\nafter UNHCR™s phase-out from RSD in Turkey \\n\\nfollowing the assumption of full responsibility \\n\\nby the Government of Turkey in September \\n\\n2018. Over the past decade, UNHCR issued \\n\\nover 723,000 substantive (positive or negative) \\n\\ndecisions globally and closed 602,900 \\n\\nadministratively. In addition to Turkey, the other \\n\\ncountries where UNHCR processed the highest \\n\\nnumber of RSD applications included Malaysia, \\n\\nJordan, Egypt, India and Kenya (prior to the \\n\\ngovernment assuming responsibility). Between \\n\\n2010 and 2019, UNHCR and States operating \\n\\njoint procedures received 149,400 applications \\n\\nand issued 55,000 substantive decisions.\\nIn response to such high numbers and in \\nacknowledgement that, unlike recognition by a \\n\\nState, UNHCR™s recognition of refugee status \\n\\ndoes not automatically give an individual access to \\n\\nprotection or solutions, UNHCR emphasized two \\n\\nkey elements in its 2016 RSD strategy, in addition \\nto supporting the assumption of responsibility by \\nStates: (1) focusing RSD interventions to situations \\n\\nin which they will have maximum protection \\n\\nimpact (e.g. facilitating access to protection and \\n\\nsolutions for the most vulnerable individuals \\n\\nor improve the protection space for entire \\n\\npopulations) and (2) reducing the time spent on \\n\\ncases while maintaining the quality of decisions.\\nDue to this rationalization of when UNHCR \\nconducts RSD under its mandate, the number of \\n\\ndecisions made by UNHCR has varied over the \\n\\nlast decade. Rather than increasing each year, it \\n\\npeaked in the years 2014-2017, in part because \\n\\nof the high number of Iraqi and Syrian cases \\n\\nprocessed for RSD for resettlement purposes in \\n\\nthe Middle East during this period. \\nWhen conducting RSD under its mandate \\nis necessary, UNHCR has increasingly used \\n\\ndierentiated case processing modalities, \\n\\nincluding various types of simpli˚ed RSD, merged \\n\\nregistration and RSD and, in a process unique to \\n\\nUNHCR, a combination of RSD and resettlement \\n\\nprocessing. In the past decade, UNHCR has \\n\\nsystematized the use of these procedures, \\n\\nand issued publicly available documentation \\n\\nabout its processes to ensure transparency and \\n\\naccountability.  \\nWrongful rejections could have dire consequences \\nfor applicants. Therefore, it is essential to \\n\\nhave fair asylum procedures.

These \\n\\nfour countries together registered half of all \\n\\nUASC asylum claims worldwide, mainly by \\n\\nunaccompanied children from Afghanistan, \\n\\nEritrea and Syria.\\nIt is important to note that data on UASC \\nseeking asylum is an underestimate because \\n\\nmany countries registering asylum-seekers do \\n\\nnot report on unaccompanied and separated \\n\\nchildren separately. \\nREGISTERED REFUGEES\\nIn 2017, UNHCR began to report on the number \\nof unaccompanied and separated children in the \\n\\nrefugee population from UNHCR refugee \\n\\nregisters and in 2018 requested governments to \\n\\ndo the same. In response, 53 countries reported \\n\\na total of 111,000 unaccompanied and separated \\n\\nchild refugees in 2018. This number increased to \\n\\n153,300 in 2019.

Planning \\n\\nfor solutions from the outset of displacement \\n\\nis one of the primary objectives of the Global \\n\\nCompact on Refugees (GCR). \\nThis chapter focuses primarily on durable solutions \\nfor refugees. Traditionally, durable solutions \\n\\ninclude voluntary repatriation, resettlement to a \\n\\nthird country and local integration. However, a \\n\\ngrowing number of people of concern to UNHCR \\n\\nremain in precarious protection situations with little \\n\\nhope of a durable solution.  \\nOver the last decade, the world recognized that \\ngovernments, humanitarian actors and development \\n\\npartners must come together with refugees to ˚nd \\n\\ndurable solutions for those in need. This recognition \\n\\nfor comprehensive and situation-speci˚c solutions \\n\\nis at the heart of the GCR and its Comprehensive \\n\\nRefugee Response Framework (CRRF). The GCR \\n\\nseeks to strengthen solutions in two main ways: \\n1) to expand access to resettlement and other \\ncomplementary pathways in third countries; 2) to \\n\\nfoster conditions that enable refugees to return \\n\\nvoluntarily to their home countries.\\nDespite these initiatives, solutions for refugees are \\nin decline. Resettlement bene˚ts only a fraction \\n\\nof the world™s refugees. In 2019, only half a per \\n\\ncent of the world™s refugees were resettled. Over \\n\\nthe past 10 years, just over one million refugees \\n\\nwere resettled, compared to 3.9 million refugees \\n\\nwho returned to their country. Thus, for every \\n\\nrefugee resettled since 2010, approximately 4 \\n\\nhave repatriated. This is in stark contrast to one for \\n\\nevery 12 during the prior decade when almost 10 \\n\\nmillion refugees repatriated and 810,400 refugees \\n\\nwere resettled Œ a strong sign that as conˆicts \\n\\nrage on without end, voluntary repatriation as a \\n\\nsolution for refugees is diminishing over time.\\n5757 By comparison, between 1990 and 1999 more than 15 million \\nrefugees voluntarily repatriated while more than 1.3 million were \\nresettled. \\nCHAPTER 5\\n48CHAPTER 5TUNISIA. \\nA six-year-old Syrian refugee \\ntakes part in an interactive theatre \\nactivity in Tunis.

Almost 21,000 Karen \\n\\nrefugees have been resettled to Australia \\n\\nduring the same time period. \\nIn Bendigo, the local community identi˚ed \\nthat resettlement had ﬂan unexpected and \\n\\npositive impact on the broader community \\n\\nand, as a result, contributing to an \\n\\nappreciation of the contribution new settlers \\n\\ncan make in other waysﬂ.  \\nIn addition to the social contribution, economic \\nmodelling undertaken by the report™s authors \\n\\nestimated that over a 10-year period, the total \\n\\neconomic impact from the regional resettlement \\n\\nof the Karen population on the Bendigo \\n\\neconomy was just more than 67 million \\n\\nAustralian dollars (in net present value terms), \\n63 https://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/pages/economics/articles/\\neconomic-social-impact-karen-resettlement.html\\nwith an associated impact on employment of \\n\\n177 full-time-equivalent jobs. In common with \\n\\nrefugee populations globally, the Karen \\n\\npopulation currently comprises a \\n\\ndisproportionately high share of children. The \\n\\nreport predicts that, all things being equal, the \\n\\nKaren labour force will continue to grow over \\n\\ntime, adding to the productive capacity of the \\n\\nregion in years to come. \\nThe research indicates that several conditions led \\nto the success of resettlement in Bendigo, \\n\\nincluding strong leadership from both the host \\n\\nand the settling communities as well as the \\n\\navailability of opportunities for employment and \\n\\nordable housing. In addition, the support \\n\\nprovided in the transition from school to work or \\n\\nfurther training in Bendigo for Karen youth \\n\\nencourages their aspirations to study and to ˚nd \\n\\n‚good™ jobs and provides opportunities for high \\n\\nlevels of participation in the community, education \\n\\nand workplaces. Lastly, the report highlights the \\n\\nresponsiveness of the services in the region and \\n\\nthe natural advantages of relatively small regional \\n\\ncities such as Bendigo in terms of lifestyle and as \\n\\na safe place to raise a family.\\nLocal integration \\nMillions of refugees around the world live \\n\\nwith little hope of ever returning home. When \\n\\nresettlement or repatriation are not options, \\n\\nbuilding a new life in the country of asylum oers \\n\\na durable solution to their plight.\\nLocal integration of refugees can include the \\nprovision of legal status and naturalization. It is \\n\\na dynamic and two-way process. Refugees must \\n\\nbe prepared to adapt to their new country, while \\n\\nhost communities and public institutions who \\n\\nwelcome refugees must strive to meet the needs \\n\\nof a diverse population. To eectively integrate \\n\\nrefugees, institutions at national and local levels, \\nas well as local communities and civil society, \\n\\nshould proactively foster social cohesion and \\n\\nensure refugees can access the job market.\\nGlobally, the integration of refugees in the \\ncountries™ labour markets remains challenging. \\n\\nFor example, in Uganda, a 2018 survey by the \\n\\nWorld Bank estimated that 4 in 5 refugees were \\n\\nunemployed and refugees earn wages that are 35 \\n\\nto 45 per cent lower than the host population.\\n64 Refugees have a lower employment rate than \\n\\ncompared to the native-born population and \\n\\nother migrants, making refugees one of the most \\n\\nvulnerable groups in the labour market. \\n64\\n https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/32511\\n53CHAPTER 5Data from a 2014 European Labour Force Survey\\n65 shows that approximately 50 per cent of refugees \\nin Europe had jobs. More recent data for Germany \\n\\nshow that while only some 40 per cent of the \\n\\nworking-age refugee population were employed \\n\\nby the third quarter of 2019, the integration of \\n\\nrefugees in the labour market is progressing faster \\n\\nthan expected compared to previous arrivals of \\n\\nrefugees,\\n66 according to the Institute for Labour \\nMarket and Occupational Research (IAB). \\nThe \\nInternational Recommendations on Refugee \\nStatistics\\n67 make several recommendations \\non appropriate indicators for measuring and \\n\\nquantifying local integration in a way that is \\n\\ncomparable and consistent across dierent \\n\\ncontexts. However, throughout the decade, the \\n\\navailability of data about refugees has remained \\n\\nvery poor. Naturalization Œ the legal act or \\n\\nprocess by which a non-citizen in a country may \\n\\nacquire citizenship or nationality of that country \\n\\nŒ is therefore used as a proxy measure of local \\n\\nintegration. However, even this proxy is limited by \\n\\nthe uneven availability of data and poor coverage \\n65\\n How are refugees faring on the labour market in Europe?, \\nDirectorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion \\n(European Commission), Organisation for Economic Co-operation \\n\\nand Development, 2016: \\nhttps://op.europa.eu/s/n6zq\\n 66 https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/arbeitsmarktforscher-\\nzufrieden-integration-von-fluechtlingen-geht-ein-jahr-schneller-\\n\\nals-gedacht_id_11000535.html\\n67\\n See \\nhttps://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic-social/Standards-\\nand-Methods/files/Principles_and_Recommendations/\\n\\nInternational-Migration/2018_1746_EN_08-E.pdf\\nas well as policy and legal changes over time. In \\nparticular, it can be dicult to distinguish between \\n\\nthe naturalization of refugees and non-refugees. \\n\\nTherefore, the data are only indicative at best \\n\\nand provide an underestimate of the extent to \\n\\nwhich refugees are naturalized. In view of the \\n\\ncurrent challenges with the availability of relevant \\n\\nstatistics on naturalization, UNHCR continues \\n\\nto explore opportunities with governments to \\n\\naddress these gaps.  \\nDuring the last decade, based on available \\nstatistics, nearly 322,400 refugees from 185 \\n\\ncountries naturalized in 65 countries. The number \\n\\nof countries reporting at least one naturalized \\n\\nrefugee has decreased from 31 in 2010 to 25 in \\n\\n2019. However, the number of naturalized refugees \\n\\nin absolute terms has increased by almost ˚ve \\n\\ntimes from 11,600 in 2010 to 55,000 in 2019. \\n\\nThis is due both to increases in the number of \\n\\nnaturalizations as well as better reporting. For \\n\\nexample, 79,000 Syrians naturalized in Turkey \\n\\nbetween 2017 and 2018,\\n68 and in Canada reporting \\ncommenced in 2013 where the annual number of \\n\\nrefugees who have naturalized has doubled from \\n\\n14,800 in 2013 to 31,200 in 2019. Similarly, in the \\n\\nNetherlands reporting commenced recently and \\n\\nbetween 2017 and 2019, 26,800 refugees obtained \\n\\nDutch nationality, 12,300 of them in 2019.\\n68 No data available for 2019.\\nYEMEN\\n.

By \\n\\nthe end of the fourth quarter 2018, 51 per cent \\n\\nof refugees in Norway were employed, \\n\\ncompared to around 64 per cent among \\n\\nimmigrants in general and 73 per cent in the \\n\\npopulation as a whole.  \\nThese overall ˚gures do, however, conceal big \\ndierences. Employment rates vary by factors \\n\\nsuch as sex, age, education level, years of \\n\\nresidence and language pro˚ciency (as well as \\n\\ncombinations of these).  \\nIt takes time for refugees to access the labour \\n\\nmarket, and as Figure 25 shows, employment is \\n\\nalmost three times higher among those with the \\n\\nlongest period of stay (20+ years) compared to \\n\\nthe groups that have recently arrived (0-4 \\n\\nyears).  \\nRefugees who have been in Norway for a long \\nperiod of time (e.g. from Sri Lanka and \\n\\nMyanmar) have employment rates almost at the \\n\\nsame level as the general Norwegian \\n\\npopulation. Among those who have arrived \\n\\nrelatively recently in Norway (e.g. Syrians), many \\n\\nare still enrolled in mandatory introductory \\n\\nprogrammes and are thus not yet available for \\n\\nthe labour market.\\n69  69 Throughout most of Europe, the Labour Force Survey (LFS), \\nan interview-based survey, is used to measure the overall \\nemployment and unemployment rate. It is also used to \\n\\nmeasure how refugees and immigrants integrate into the \\n\\nEuropean labour market. The LFS is, however, not an ideal tool \\n\\nto measure participation rates of smaller groups in the society \\n\\nas the sample size is often too small for detailed analysis. \\n\\nImmigrants, in particular, will also have a significant selective \\n\\nnon-response. In Norway, in addition to the LFS, a combination \\n\\nof administrative registers is used to measure the employment \\n\\nand unemployment rates. Data from these registers open up \\n\\nfor detailed analysis broken down by important variables such \\n\\nas sex, age, years of residence and country background.

According to available data, \\n\\n51 per cent of the stateless population in 2019 \\n\\nwere women, and 48 per cent were children. \\n\\nDemographically disaggregated data was most \\n\\navailable in the West and Central Africa and the \\n\\nAsia-Paci˚c regions. Stateless Rohingya refugees \\n\\nhosted in Bangladesh make up the majority \\n\\nof the stateless population in the Asia-Paci˚c \\n\\nregion, and there is solid demographic coverage \\n\\navailable about them because they are individually \\n\\nregistered as refugees in UNHCR™s case \\n\\nmanagement system (proGres). This is not the \\n\\ncase for Rohingya remaining in Myanmar for whom \\n\\nthe availability of demographic data is very low. \\nThe results from the study on statelessness \\nin Côte d™Ivoire mentioned above allow for \\nage- and sex-disaggregation of data on close \\n\\nto one million stateless persons and are an \\n\\nimportant step in improving the evidence base \\n\\non statelessness in the region. \\nFˇ˘ 29\\n shows \\nthe demographic pro˚le of displaced stateless \\n\\nRohingya refugees in Bangladesh and of non-\\n\\ndisplaced stateless persons in Côte d™Ivoire. \\n\\nFifty-six per cent of Rohingya in Bangladesh \\n\\nare children under the age of 18, considerably \\n\\nmore than in the general population in Myanmar, \\n\\ntheir country of origin, where 31 per cent are \\n\\nunderage. Women constitute 52 per cent of \\n\\ndisplaced stateless Rohingya in Bangladesh. \\n\\nWhile the stateless population in Côte d™Ivoire \\n\\nhas slightly more women than men overall, with \\n\\n53 per cent being female, this imbalance is very \\n\\ndistinct for adult age groups from 18 to 59 as \\n\\nvisible from the demographic pro˚le. Qualitative \\n\\nevidence suggests that proportionally fewer girls \\n\\nare enrolled in school and registered at birth \\n\\ncompared to boys. This lack of documentation can \\n\\npersist into adulthood and signi˚cantly impede \\n\\naccess to citizenship for women.

In \\n\\naddition, the study showed signi˚cant dierences \\n\\nin educational enrolment between stateless \\n\\nand Kenyan children: the gross enrolment rate \\n\\nat secondary level for stateless children was 50 \\n\\nper cent compared to 78 per cent for nationals. \\n\\nStateless girls were even less likely to receive \\n\\nsecondary education, with a secondary gross \\n\\nenrolment rate of only 37 per cent compared to \\n\\n65 per cent for stateless boys. While these results \\n\\nare from one study alone and further research \\n\\nis required and planned, the study results are \\n\\nnotable in terms of the speci˚c inequalities in \\n\\naccess to education as one basic service stateless \\n\\npersons and stateless girls in particular face. \\nSome displaced people are also stateless. While \\n\\nUNHCR has historically not reported on multiple \\n\\nstatuses, in 2017 it was decided that it was important \\n\\nto report on the displaced stateless Rohingya \\n\\npopulation as having both refugee and stateless \\n\\nstatus. Therefore, this population is included in both \\n\\nthe displaced and statelessness counts. In addition \\n\\nto Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh who have been \\n\\nreported under UNHCR™s statelessness ˚gures \\n\\nsince 2017, displaced Rohingya in India, Indonesia, \\n\\nMalaysia and Thailand are included in the number of \\n\\nstateless persons for the ˚rst time in 2019. This led \\n\\nto signi˚cant increases in statelessness ˚gures in \\n\\nIndia (17,730 displaced stateless persons), Indonesia \\n\\n(580) and Malaysia. In Malaysia, the inclusion of \\n\\ndisplaced stateless persons led to an increase in the \\n\\ntotal number by almost 100,000 in 2019, consisting \\n\\nof Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers displaced \\n\\nfrom Myanmar.

Recognition of \\nstatelessness and gathering data about the \\n\\nproblem are key elements in UNHCR™s Global \\n\\nAction Plan to End Statelessness (Global Action \\n\\nPlan), which accompanies the #IBelong Campaign. \\n\\nTo improve quantitative and qualitative data \\n\\non stateless populations, UNHCR works with \\n\\nStates to undertake targeted surveys and studies \\n\\nand to incorporate questions allowing for the \\n\\nidenti˚cation of stateless persons in population \\n\\nand housing censuses. The Global Action Plan \\n\\nalso calls for the strengthening of civil registration \\n\\nand vital statistics systems and UNHCR works with \\n\\nothers to provide technical support to this end.\\nMany countries have made strong commitments \\nto address and end statelessness.

Combining \\n\\nUNHCR and government registration highlights \\n\\nthe importance of establishing proper registration \\n\\nprocedures not only for refugee statistics but more \\n\\nimportantly for protecting and assisting refugees. \\n\\nThis underscores the importance of ongoing \\n\\ncoordination, cooperation and capacity building \\n\\nbetween UNHCR, national statistical oces and \\n\\nother relevant government agencies.\\nFigure 31\\n   |  Data collection/compilation method for refugees, by UNHCR region\\n  |  end-2019\\n•‡…•‡—•‡–•‡ƒ•‡⁄•‡‹•‡›•‡−•‡‰•‡…••‡\\n69CHAPTER 7Internally displaced persons\\nIDPs are people who have been forced to leave \\nor abandon their homes, and have not crossed \\n\\nan internationally recognized border. People ˆee \\n\\nwithin their own countries to avoid the eects of \\n\\narmed conˆict, situations of generalized violence, \\n\\nviolations of human rights or natural- and human-\\n\\nmade disasters. UNHCR compiles data only on \\n\\nconˆict-generated IDPs to whom the organization \\n\\nextends protection and/or assistance. As such, \\n\\nUNHCR statistics do not provide a complete \\n\\noverview of global internal displacement. The \\n\\nInternal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) \\n\\nmaintains a database on IDPs displaced due to \\n\\nviolence and conˆict, as well as due to disasters, \\n\\nproviding a more comprehensive picture of \\n\\nglobal internal displacement. For the purpose \\n\\nof analysing global forced displacement, ˚gures \\n\\nquoted in this report match the numbers on IDPs \\n\\ndisplaced by conˆict or violence as reported in \\n\\nIDMC™s Global Report on Forced Displacement \\n\\n2020.\\n79 Data on IDPs comes from a wide range \\nof methods and data compilers from NGOs to \\n\\ngovernment oces, with methods including \\n\\namong others displacement tracking, household \\n\\nsurveys, censuses and pro˚ling exercises.\\nStateless persons\\nUNHCR compiles ˚gures on persons under \\nits statelessness mandate for two population \\n\\ngroups. The ˚rst are persons who meet the \\n\\nstatelessness de˚nition in the 1954 Convention \\n\\nbecause they are not considered as nationals of \\n\\nany State. The second group are persons with \\n\\nundetermined nationality, a population group \\n\\nfor which UNHCR collects data in response to \\n79 https://www.internal-displacement.org/global-report/grid2020/\\n Executive Committee Conclusion No. 106 from \\n\\n2006.\\n80 While a formal de˚nition of a person \\nwith undetermined nationality does not exist, \\n\\nUNHCR uses the working de˚nition of a person \\n\\nwho lacks proof of possession of any nationality \\n\\nand who at the same time has or is perceived as \\n\\nhaving important links to more than one State. \\n\\nPersons with undetermined nationality have in \\n\\nmany cases a migratory history that leads to an \\n\\nunresolved nationality status. UNHCR previously \\n\\nalso reported on de facto stateless populations \\n\\nbut discontinued doing so in mid-2019 based \\n\\non an assessment that de facto statelessness \\n\\nwas often incorrectly used to refer to people \\n\\nwho meet the statelessness de˚nition in the \\n\\n1954 Convention and who should therefore \\n\\nbe reported as such. Over the past decade, \\n\\nthese concepts and de˚nitions have sometimes \\n\\nbeen applied inconsistently by UNHCR country \\n\\noperations for the annual statistical reporting \\n\\nprocess.\\n81 It is therefore challenging to compare \\nstatelessness ˚gures across dierent countries or \\n\\neven to compare ˚gures in the same country for \\n\\ndierent years. \\nTo identify stateless persons and develop \\nreliable methods for statelessness estimation, \\n\\nit is important to recognize the dierent causes \\n\\nof statelessness. Nationality laws that are \\n\\ninconsistent with international standards and \\n\\nstate succession are responsible for a signi˚cant \\n\\nproportion of today™s known global stateless \\n\\npopulation. Migration, nomadism and forced \\n\\ndisplacement are additional potential causes \\n\\nof statelessness.

TABLE 1\\n77NOTES\\n˜The data are generally provided by governments, based on their own de˚nitions and methods of data collection.1 Country or territory of asylum or residence.\\n2 Refugees include individuals recognized under the 1951 Convention relating \\nto the Status of Refugees, its 1967 Protocol, the 1969 Organization of \\nAfrican Unity (OAU) Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee \\n\\nProblems in Africa, the refugee definition contained in the 1984 Cartagena \\n\\nDeclaration on Refugees as incorporated into national laws, those recognized \\n\\nin accordance with the UNHCR Statute, individuals granted complementary \\n\\nforms of protection, and those enjoying temporary protection. In the absence \\n\\nof Government figures, UNHCR has estimated the refugee population in \\n\\nmany industrialized countries based on 10 years of individual asylum-seeker \\n\\nrecognition.\\n3 This category is descriptive in nature and includes groups of people who are \\noutside their country or territory of origin and who face protection risks similar \\n\\nto those of refugees, but for whom refugee status has, for practical or other \\n\\nreasons, not been ascertained.\\n4 Asylum-seekers (with pending cases) are individuals who have sought \\ninternational protection and whose claims for refugee status have not yet been \\n\\ndetermined. Those covered in this table refer to claimants whose individual \\n\\napplications were pending at the end of 2019, irrespective of when those claims \\n\\nmay have been lodged.\\n5 Refugees who have returned to their place of origin during 2019. Source: \\ncountry of origin and asylum.\\n6 IDPs are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee \\nor to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result \\n\\nof, or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized \\n\\nviolence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and \\n\\nwho have not crossed an internationally recognized State border. For the \\n\\npurposes of UNHCR™s statistics, this population includes only conflict-generated \\n\\nIDPs to whom the Office extends protection and/or assistance.\\n7 IDPs of concern to UNHCR who have returned to their place of origin during \\n2019.\\n8 Refers to persons who are not considered as nationals by any State under \\nthe operation of its law. This category refers to persons who fall under the \\n\\nagency™s statelessness mandate because they are stateless according to this \\n\\ninternational definition, but data from some countries may also include persons \\n\\nwith undetermined nationality. The figure reported includes stateless persons \\n\\nwho are also refugees or asylum-seekers from Myanmar, IDPs in Myanmar, or \\n\\nothers of concern to UNHCR. UNHCR™s statistical reporting generally follows a \\n\\nmethodology that reports on one legal status for each person of concern only. \\n\\nHowever, due to the extraordinary size of the displaced stateless population \\n\\nfrom Myanmar, UNHCR considers it important to reflect the dual status that \\n\\nthis population group possesses, pending a review of UNHCR reporting \\n\\non statelessness. See Annex Table 5 at \\nhttps://www.unhcr.org/refugee-\\n\\nstatistics/2019GTannextableSTA.xls \\nfor detailed notes.\\n9 Refers to individuals who do not necessarily fall directly into any of these groups \\nabove but to whom UNHCR has extended its protection and/or assistance \\n\\nservices, based on humanitarian or other special grounds.\\n10\\n Venezuelans displaced abroad refers to persons of Venezuelan origin who \\nare likely to be in need of international protection under the criteria contained \\n\\nin the Cartagena Declaration, but who have not applied for asylum in the \\n\\ncountry in which they are present. Regardless of status, Venezuelans displaced \\n\\nabroad require protection against forced returns, and access to basic services. \\n\\nUNHCR and the International Organization for Migration work together with this \\n\\npopulation by leading the Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform, which \\n\\nis aimed at strengthening the protection dimensions and consistent responses \\n\\nacross the region in line with human rights standards.\\n11\\n The statelessness figure refers to a census from 2011 and has been adjusted \\nto reflect the number of persons with undetermined nationality who had their \\n\\nnationality confirmed in 2011-2019.\\n12\\n According to the Government of Algeria, there are an estimated 165,000 \\nSahrawi refugees in the Tindouf camps. Statistical data relating to refugees \\n\\nare entirely for humanitarian purposes. The total number of persons in need of \\n\\nhumanitarian assistance services is estimated to be far higher than this figure.\\n13\\n The methodology for estimating the number of refugees in Australia is under \\nreview and subject to adjustment in future reports. The asylum-seeker figure is \\n\\nbased on the number of applications lodged for protection visas.\\n14\\n The figure reported includes 854,704 stateless persons of Rohingya ethnicity \\nwho are also counted as refugees from Myanmar, mainly from Rakhine State. \\n\\nUNHCR™s statistical reporting generally follows a methodology that reports only \\n\\none legal status for each person of concern. However, due to the size of the \\nstateless Rohingya population displaced from Myanmar, UNHCR considers it \\n\\nimportant to reflect the dual status of this population group as both displaced \\n\\nand stateless. This approach has been used for Bangladesh since 2017.\\n15\\n The 303,100 Vietnamese refugees are well integrated and in practice receive \\nprotection from the Government of China.\\n16\\n The figure of Others of concern has been provided by the Government of \\nColombia. With regard to the statelessness figures, in 2019, Colombia granted \\n\\nnationality by birth to 28,500 children with undetermined nationality born in \\n\\nColombia to Venezuelan parents displaced abroad. As these children were both \\n\\nidentified as persons with undetermined nationality and granted Colombian \\n\\nnationality in 2019, there was no impact on the figures reported. \\n17\\n The new statelessness figure is based on a 2019 mapping study jointly \\nconducted by the Government and UNHCR.\\n18\\n The figure of IDP returns was released by the ﬁCommissions de mouvements de \\npopulationﬂ and covers the period from April 2018 to September 2019.\\n19\\n UNHCR is currently working with the authorities and other actors to determine \\nthe size of the population that found an effective nationality solution under \\n\\nLaw 169-14. Since the adoption of Law 169-14 in May 2014, important steps \\n\\nhave been taken by the Dominican Republic to confirm Dominican nationality \\n\\nthrough the validation of birth certificates of individuals born in the country \\n\\nto two migrant parents before 2007. According to information shared by the \\n\\nDominican delegation during the 2019 High-Level Segment on Statelessness, \\n\\napproximately 48 per cent of the total Group A population of 61,049 persons \\n\\nhad been authorized by the National Electoral Board (JCE) to request their \\n\\nnationality documentation. Additionally, as of December 2019, over 1,700 \\n\\nGroup B persons (900 of which were children) had submitted applications for \\n\\nnaturalization to the Ministry of Interior and of the Police (MIP). However, no \\n\\nnaturalization decisions concerning this population have been issued to date.\\n20\\n Almost all people recorded as being stateless have permanent residence and \\nenjoy more rights than foreseen in the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of \\n\\nStateless Persons.\\n21\\n The total statelessness figure reported relates to 17,730 stateless persons of \\nRohingya ethnicity who are also counted as refugees or asylum-seekers from \\n\\nMyanmar, mainly from Rakhine State. UNHCR™s statistical reporting generally \\n\\nfollows a methodology that reports only one legal status for each person \\n\\nof concern. However, due to the size of the stateless Rohingya population \\n\\ndisplaced from Myanmar, UNHCR considers it important to reflect the dual \\n\\nstatus of this population group as both displaced and stateless. This approach is \\n\\nbeing used for India for the first time in 2019.\\n22 \\nThe total statelessness figure reported relates to 582 stateless persons of \\nRohingya ethnicity who are also counted as refugees or asylum-seekers from \\n\\nMyanmar, mainly from Rakhine State. UNHCR™s statistical reporting generally \\n\\nfollows a methodology that reports only one legal status for each person \\n\\nof concern. However, due to the size of the stateless Rohingya population \\n\\ndisplaced from Myanmar, UNHCR considers it important to reflect the dual \\n\\nstatus of this population group as both displaced and stateless. This approach \\n\\nis being used for Indonesia for the first time in 2019. There are also indications \\n\\nthat a potentially sizable population of non-displaced stateless persons exists \\n\\nfor whom no data is available.\\n23\\n Pending a more accurate study into statelessness in Iraq, the figure is an \\nestimate based on various sources.\\n24\\n Figures are UNHCR estimates.\\n25\\n The refugee population in Jordan includes 34,300 Iraqis registered with \\nUNHCR. The Government of Jordan estimated the number of Iraqis at 400,000 \\n\\nindividuals at the end of March 2015. This includes refugees and other \\n\\ncategories of Iraqis.\\n26\\n All 58 persons were in the final stages of naturalization or citizenship \\nconfirmation formalities.\\n27\\n With respect to persons under UNHCR™s statelessness mandate, this figure \\nincludes persons of concern covered by two separate Latvian laws. 169 persons \\n\\nfall under the Republic of Latvia™s Law on Stateless Persons of 17 February \\n\\n2004. 216,682 of the persons fall under Latvia™s 25 April 1995 Law on the Status \\n\\nof those Former USSR Citizens who are not Citizens of Latvia or Any Other State \\n\\n(ﬁNon-citizensﬂ). In the specific context of Latvia, the ﬁNon-citizensﬂ enjoy the \\n\\nright to reside in Latvia ex lege and a set of rights and obligations generally \\n\\nbeyond the rights prescribed by the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of \\n\\nStateless Persons, including protection from removal, and as such the ﬁNon-\\n\\ncitizensﬂ may currently be considered persons to whom the Convention does \\n\\nnot apply in accordance with Article 1.2(ii).\\n28\\n The total stateless population in Malaysia includes 9,040 non-displaced \\nstateless persons who may be entitled to Malaysian nationality under the law. \\n\\nThis number of non-displaced stateless persons is based on a registration and \\n\\ncommunity legal assistance programme undertaken in West Malaysia by a local \\n\\nNGO with technical support from UNHCR, and, among those registered, 930 \\n\\npersons acquired Malaysian nationality in 2019. \\nANNEX TABLE 2\\n78Origin1REFUGEESAsylum-seekers \\n(pending \\ncases)4Returned \\nrefugees5IDPs of \\nconcern to \\nUNHCR6Returned \\nIDPs7Persons \\nunder \\nUNHCR™s \\nstatelessness \\nmandate8Others of \\nconcern to \\nUNHCR9Venezuelans \\ndisplaced \\nabroad10Total \\npopulation \\nof concernRefugees \\n2People in \\nrefugee-like \\nsituations3Total \\nrefugees and \\npeople in \\nrefugee-like \\nsituationsAfghanistan\\n2,721,4757,3832,728,858251,0428,4022,553,390\\n--450,675\\n-5,992,367Albania15,034-15,03419,007\\n----1-34,042Algeria4,53914,5407,494\\n----104-12,138\\nAndorra3-32------5Angola8,190\\n-8,19010,783\\n----18,242-37,215\\nAntigua and Barbuda119-11963\\n------182Argentina107-107934\\n----3-1,044Armenia10,967\\n-10,96711,107\\n----4-22,078Aruba---1------1Australia\\n1531858\\n------76Austria\\n20-2012------32Azerbaijan11,05357311,6268,239\\n-652,326--1-672,192\\nBahamas498-498519\\n------1,017Bahrain560-560151\\n----1-712Bangladesh22,8712422,89534,535\\n----503-57,933\\nBarbados246-246117\\n------363Belarus3,434-3,4344,029\\n----2-7,465\\nBelgium37-37106\\n------143Belize73-73278\\n------351Benin722-7221,181\\n----6-1,909Bhutan6,989-6,989414\\n------7,403\\nBolivia (Plurinational \\nState of)\\n522-5221,246\\n------1,768\\nBosnia and \\n Herzegovina16,559-16,5591,484\\n-96,421--48,907-163,371Botswana232-232132\\n------364Brazil1,402-1,40212,054\\n----1-13,457Brunei Darussalam5-513------18Bulgaria567-567351\\n----4-922Burkina Faso11,742\\n-11,7424,967\\n-560,033\\n--2,190\\n-578,932Burundi381,515-381,51546,00821,18133,256\\n--17,606\\n-499,566\\nCabo Verde\\n13-13246\\n------259Cambodia11,9315611,987844\\n------12,831Cameroon66,301-66,30119\\n,9041950,263347,923\\n-9-1,384,401Canada73-73102\\n----3-178Cayman Islands8-8-------8Central African Rep.\\n610,215\\n-610,21515,95546,523669,90690,672\\n-1,571-1,434,842Chad11,202-11,2025,354308170,278\\n--122,368-309,510\\nChile493-4931,249\\n------1,742\\nChina212,885-212,885104,169\\n------317,054\\nChina, Hong Kong SAR\\n8-8228------236China, Macao SAR\\n1-132------3380,694108,760189,45475,550317,976,412\\n--400,001\\n-8,641,448Comoros656-6561,451\\n------2,107\\nCongo, Republic of\\n13,479-13,4793,128\\n4134,4305,312\\n-38-156,391Costa Rica210-210746\\n------956Côte d™Ivoire39,375\\n-39,37519,7163,252\\n---34-62,377Croatia23,799\\n-23,7997213\\n---3,754\\n-27,638\\nCuba6,638-6,63855,942\\n----1-62,581Curaçao35-35-------35Cyprus4-436------40Czechia1,168\\n-1,168183\\n------1,351TABLE \\n2   |  Refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees (refugees and \\nIDPs), stateless persons, others of concern to UNHCR and Venezuelans displaced abroad, by origin\\n  |  end-2019\\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. \\nData is available at: https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics\\n\\nA dash (\"-\") indicates that the value is zero, not available or not applicable.\\nANNEX TABLE 2\\n79Origin1REFUGEESAsylum-seekers \\n(pending \\ncases)4Returned \\nrefugees5IDPs of \\nconcern to \\nUNHCR6Returned \\nIDPs7Persons \\nunder \\nUNHCR™s \\nstatelessness \\nmandate8Others of \\nconcern to \\nUNHCR9Venezuelans \\ndisplaced \\nabroad10Total \\npopulation \\nof concernRefugees \\n2People in \\nrefugee-like \\nsituations3Total \\nrefugees and \\npeople in \\nrefugee-like \\nsituationsDem.

data are generally provided by governments, based on their own de˚nitions and methods of data collection.1 Country or territory of origin.\\n2 Refugees include individuals recognized under the 1951 Convention relating to the \\nStatus of Refugees, its 1967 Protocol, the 1969 Organization of African Unity (OAU) \\nConvention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, the \\n\\nrefugee definition contained in the 1984 Cartagena Declaration on Refugees as \\n\\nincorporated into national laws, those recognized in accordance with the UNHCR \\n\\nStatute, individuals granted complementary forms of protection, and those \\n\\nenjoying temporary protection. In the absence of Government figures, UNHCR \\n\\nhas estimated the refugee population in many industrialized countries based on 10 \\n\\nyears of individual asylum-seeker recognition.\\n3 This category is descriptive in nature and includes groups of people who are \\noutside their country or territory of origin and who face protection risks similar \\n\\nto those of refugees, but for whom refugee status has, for practical or other \\n\\nreasons, not been ascertained.\\n4 Asylum-seekers (with pending cases) are individuals who have sought \\ninternational protection and whose claims for refugee status have not yet been \\n\\ndetermined. Those covered in this table refer to claimants whose individual \\n\\napplications were pending at the end of 2019, irrespective of when those claims \\n\\nmay have been lodged.\\n5 Refugees who have returned to their place of origin during 2019. Source: country \\nof origin and asylum.\\n6 IDPs are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee \\nor to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result \\n\\nof, or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized \\n\\nviolence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and \\n\\nwho have not crossed an internationally recognized State border. For the \\n\\npurposes of UNHCR™s statistics, this population includes only conflict-generated \\n\\nIDPs to whom the Office extends protection and/or assistance.\\n7 IDPs of concern to UNHCR who have returned to their place of origin during 2019.\\n8 Refers to persons who are not considered as nationals by any State under \\nthe operation of its law. This category refers to persons who fall under the \\n\\nagency™s statelessness mandate because they are stateless according to this \\n\\ninternational definition, but data from some countries may also include persons \\n\\nwith undetermined nationality. The figure reported includes stateless persons \\n\\nwho are also refugees or asylum-seekers from Myanmar, IDPs in Myanmar, or \\n\\nothers of concern to UNHCR. UNHCR™s statistical reporting generally follows a \\nmethodology that reports on one legal status for each person of concern only. \\n\\nHowever, due to the extraordinary size of the displaced stateless population \\n\\nfrom Myanmar, UNHCR considers it important to reflect the dual status that \\n\\nthis population group possesses, pending a review of UNHCR reporting \\n\\non statelessness. See Annex Table 5 at \\nhttps://www.unhcr.org/refugee-\\n\\nstatistics/2019GTannextableSTA.xls\\n for detailed notes.\\n9 Refers to individuals who do not necessarily fall directly into any of these groups \\nabove but to whom UNHCR has extended its protection and/or assistance \\n\\nservices, based on humanitarian or other special grounds.\\n10\\n Venezuelans displaced abroad refers to persons of Venezuelan origin who \\nare likely to be in need of international protection under the criteria contained \\n\\nin the Cartagena Declaration, but who have not applied for asylum in the \\n\\ncountry in which they are present. Regardless of status, Venezuelans displaced \\n\\nabroad require protection against forced returns, and access to basic services. \\n\\nUNHCR and the International Organization for Migration work together with this \\n\\npopulation by leading the Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform, which \\n\\nis aimed at strengthening the protection dimensions and consistent responses \\n\\nacross the region in line with human rights standards.\\n11\\n The figure of Others of concern has been provided by the Government of \\nColombia.\\n12\\n The figure of IDP returns was released by the ﬁCommissions de mouvements de \\npopulationﬂ and covers the period from April 2018 to September 2019.\\n13\\n The refugee population in Jordan includes 34,300 Iraqis registered with \\nUNHCR. The Government of Jordan estimated the number of Iraqis at 400,000 \\n\\nindividuals at the end of March 2015. This includes refugees and other \\n\\ncategories of Iraqis.\\n14\\n Refers to Palestinian refugees under the UNHCR mandate only.\\n15\\n The IDP figure has been aligned to the inter-agency methodology as defined in the \\n2020 Humanitarian Needs Overview. Figure of others of concern relates to persons \\n\\nwho have specific protection needs and live in non-government-controlled areas or \\n\\nwithin 20 km of the contact line in government-controlled areas.\\n16\\n A limited number of countries record refugee and asylum statistics by country of \\nbirth rather than country of origin. This affects the number of refugees reported \\n\\nas originating from the United States of America.\\n17\\n The 303,100 Vietnamese refugees are well integrated and in practice receive \\nprotection from the Government of China.\\n18\\n According to the Government of Algeria, there are an estimated 165,000 \\nSahrawi refugees in the Tindouf camps. Statistical data relating to refugees \\nare entirely for humanitarian purposes. The total number of persons in need of \\n\\nhumanitarian assistance services is estimated to be far higher than this figure.\\nANNEX TABLE 2\\nAt the end of 2019, the total population of concern to UNHCR stood at 86.5 million people.  \\nThis included people who have been forcibly displaced (refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced \\n\\npeople and Venezuelans displaced abroad); those who have found a durable solution (returnees) within \\n\\nthe previous year; stateless individuals, most of whom have never been forcibly displaced; and other \\n\\ngroups of concern to whom UNHCR has extended its protection or provided assistance on a \\n\\nhumanitarian basis. Therefore, this categorization is dierent from the 79.5 million forcibly displaced \\n\\npeople worldwide Œ a ˚gure that includes refugees and other displaced people not covered by \\n\\nUNHCR™s mandate and excludes other categories such as returnees and non-displaced stateless \\n\\npeople.

MIGRATION REPORT \\n1www.iom.int/wmr/world-migration-report-2018\\nWORLD MIGRATION REPORT\\nThis World Migration Report\\n update provides an overview of the latest data on international migrants in \\nAfrica. It is based on the most recent estimates from the United Nations Department of Economic and \\nSocial Affairs (UN DESA). Released in December 2017, the international migrant stock datasets estimate \\nthe number of international migrants by age, sex and origin.\\n1 In addition to presenting current data on \\ninternational migrants in Africa, the update brie˜y discusses trends in African migration.\\n2Migration in Africa involves large numbers of migrants moving both within and out of the region. As shown in \\n˚gure\\n 1, in 2017 over 19 million Africans were living in another African country, a signi˚cant increase from 2015 \\nwhen 16\\n million Africans were estimated to be living within the region. The number of Africans living in a different \\nregion only grew moderately during the same period, from around 16 million in 2015 to around 17 million in 2017. \\nFigure 1 re˜ects that since 2000 international migration within the African region has increased signi˚cantly. And \\nsince 1990, the number of African migrants living outside of the region has more than doubled, with the growth \\nto Europe most pronounced. In 2017, most African-born migrants living outside the region were residing in Europe \\n(9.3 million), Asia (4.4 million) and Northern America (2.6 million).\\nOne of the most striking aspects to note about international migrants in Africa, as shown in ˚gure 1, is the small \\nnumber of migrants who were born outside of the region and have since moved there. Between 2015 and 2017, the \\nnumber of migrants born outside the region remained virtually unchanged (around 2 million), most of whom were \\nfrom Asia and Europe.\\n1 UN DESA, 2017.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n.Migration and Migrants: AfricaUpdate\\nWORLD MIGRATION REPORT \\n2Figure 1.

In 2017, Egypt had the largest number of people \\nliving abroad, followed by Morocco, Somalia, Sudan and Algeria. In terms of the number of immigrants, South Africa \\nremains most signi˚cant destination country in Africa, with around 4 million international migrants residing in the \\ncountry (or around 7% of its total population). The number of migrants moving to South Africa increased by nearly \\n1 million between 2015 and 2017. Other countries with high immigrant populations as a proportion of their total \\npopulations included Gabon (14%), Libya (12%), Djibouti (12%), the Gambia (10%) and Côte d™Ivoire (9%).\\nWORLD MIGRATION REPORT \\n3Figure 2.

The size of a migration corridor from country A to country \\nB is measured as the number of immigrants from country A who were residing in country B in 2017. Migration \\ncorridors represent an accumulation of migratory movements over time and provide a snapshot of how migration \\npatterns have evolved into signi˚cant foreign-born populations in speci˚c destination countries. Some of the largest \\nmigration corridors involving African countries, as shown in ˚gure 3, are between North African countries such \\nas Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to France, Spain and Italy, in part re˜ecting post-colonial connections.

Importantly, just over half of the main migration corridors shown in ˚gure 3 were within Africa, with the \\ncorridor between Burkina Faso to neighbouring Côte d™Ivoire constituting the second largest for Africa overall.  \\nWORLD MIGRATION REPORT \\n4Figure 3.

Not only is the political salience of migration high, and frequently fevered, but the capacity for \\nrapidly disseminating disinformation to in˜uence the public discourse has expanded. \\nTwenty years ago, IOM published the ˚rst World Migration Report with the stated aim of providing an \\nauthoritative account of migration trends and issues worldwide. With the initial report published in 2000, \\nthe series has quickly become established as IOM™s ˜agship publication.\\nThe early World Migration Reports were framed around speci˚c themes. They provided deep dives into topics \\nsuch as labour mobility, migrant well-being and communication on migration. But, with time, there was a \\nsense that the broader landscape and complexity of migration issues was being neglected.\\nTimes have changed, dramatically so. Migration is now a top-tier political issue interconnected to human \\nrights, development, and geopolitics at national, regional and international levels.  Accordingly, IOM has \\nenhanced the ˜agship series to ensure that the World Migration Report is, in fact, a \\nworld\\n migration report. \\nWe have revamped the series to offer a more strategic contribution to the public debate. We have strengthened \\nour collaborative partnerships with scholars and applied researchers in order to bene˚t from their diverse \\nexpertise and knowledge. We have made content and structural changes to increase the World Migration \\nReport™s utility to the evidence base on migration globally, in line with IOM™s growing role in data collection \\nand analysis.\\nThe \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n is the most downloaded of all IOM publications.  It is clearly ful˚lling the \\nneed to provide a balanced understanding of migration™s complexities, present the latest global data and \\ninformation in an accessible way, and explore and explain complex and emerging migration issues.\\nAs the United Nations™ migration agency, IOM has an obligation to demystify the complexity and diversity \\nof human mobility. The report also acknowledges IOM™s continuing emphasis on fundamental rights and its \\nmission to support those migrants who are most in need. This is particularly relevant in the areas in which \\nIOM works to provide humanitarian assistance to people who have been displaced, including by weather \\nevents, con˜ict and persecution, or to those who have become stranded during crises. \\nLikewise, IOM remains committed to supporting Member States as they draw upon various forms of data, \\nresearch and analysis during policy formulation and review processes. Indeed, this is re˜ected in IOM™s \\nConstitution where the need for migration research is highlighted as an integral part of the Organization™s \\nfunctions. The World Migration Report is a central component of this important function.\\nIn this era of heightened interest and activity towards migration and migrants, we hope this 2020 edition \\nof the World Migration Report becomes a key reference point for you. We hope it helps you to navigate this \\nhigh-pro˚le and dynamic topic during periods of uncertainty, and that it prompts re˜ection during quieter \\nmoments.

Increasing numbers of people are able to access information, goods and services \\nfrom around the world because of the ongoing expansion in distance-shrinking technologies. \\nThere is also a sense that we are in the midst of a period of considerable uncertainty. Many commentators have \\ncalled into question the solidity of aspects of the global political order forged in the immediate aftermath of \\nthe two world wars, including as they relate to alliances and common interests.\\n3 Others are calling this time \\nthe ﬁage of angerﬂ, tracing back the current sense of geopolitical uncertainty and discontent to a dominant \\nand relentless focus on ﬁlogicﬂ and ﬁliberal rationalismﬂ at the expense of emotional responsiveness.\\n4 It is within this context that this world migration report focuses on developments in migration over the last \\ntwo-year period, with an emphasis on providing analysis that takes into account historical and contemporary \\nfactors. Historical in recognition that migration and displacement occur within broader long-term social, \\nsecurity, political and economic contexts. Contemporary in recognition that we are in the midst of profound \\nglobal transformations, and that the resultant changes to our daily lives are impacting the current environment \\nin which migration occurs and is discussed. \\nWhat has happened in migration?A lot has happened in migration in the last two years since the release of the \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n in late 2017.5 The world has witnessed \\nhistoric change at the global level\\n with United Nations Member \\nStates coming together to ˚nalize two global compacts on the international manifestations of migration \\nand displacement: the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, and the Global Compact \\non Refugees. The ˚nalization of the compacts is a result of decades-long efforts by States, international \\norganizations, civil society organizations and other actors (such as private sector organizations) to improve \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 1 Œ \\n2how migration is governed at the international level. In the years leading up to States committing to develop \\nthe compacts,\\n6 numerous dialogues, workshops, consultations and side events at international, regional, \\nnational as well as local levels have enabled different migration ﬁrealitiesﬂ to be shared and the many areas \\nof common interest to be expanded through deeper understandings of the bene˚ts of migration as well as the \\nchallenges it may present. The compacts, therefore, build upon many years of engagement on the key issues \\nunderpinning the two compacts. \\nThe unfortunate reality is that there have been \\nmajor migration and displacement events\\n during the last \\ntwo years; events that have caused great hardship and trauma as well as loss of life. Foremost have been \\nthe displacements of millions of people due to con˜ict (such as within and from the Syrian Arab Republic, \\nYemen, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan), extreme \\nviolence (such as in˜icted upon Rohingya forced to seek safety in Bangladesh) or severe economic and \\npolitical instability (such as faced by millions of Venezuelans). There has also been growing recognition of the \\nimpacts of environmental and climate change on human mobility (such as planned migration/relocation and \\ndisplacement), including as part of global efforts and international policy mechanisms to address the broader \\nimpacts of climate change.\\n7 Large-scale displacement triggered by climate and weather-related hazards \\noccurred in many parts of the world in 2018 and 2019, including in Mozambique, the Philippines, China, India \\nand the United States of America.\\n8  We have also seen the \\nscale of international migration increase in line with recent trends\\n. The number \\nof international migrants is estimated to be almost 272 million globally, with nearly two-thirds being labour \\nmigrants.\\n9 This ˚gure remains a very small percentage of the world™s population (at 3.5%), meaning that the \\nvast majority of people globally (96.5%) are estimated to be residing in the country in which they were born. \\nHowever, the estimated number and proportion of international migrants already surpasses some projections \\nmade for the year 2050, which were in the order of 2.6\\n per cent or 230 million.\\n10 That said, it is widely \\nrecognized that the scale and pace of international migration is notoriously dif˚cult to predict with precision \\nbecause it is closely connected to acute events (such as severe instability, economic crisis or con˜ict) as \\nwell as long-term trends (such as demographic change, economic development, communications technology \\nadvances and transportation access).\\n11 We also know from long-term data that international migration is not \\nuniform across the world but is shaped by economic, geographic, demographic and other factors resulting \\nin distinct migration patterns, such as migration ﬁcorridorsﬂ developed over many years (see chapter 3 of \\nthis report for details). The largest corridors tend to be from developing countries to larger economies such \\nas those of the United States, France, the Russian Federation, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. \\nThis pattern is likely to remain the same for many years into the future, especially as populations in some \\ndeveloping subregions and countries are projected to increase in coming decades, placing migration pressure \\non future generations.\\n12Highlights from Part I of the report on data and information on migration and migrants are outlined below. \\nFurther information and discussion are provided in the report.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n3Highlights from Part I: Data and information on migration and migrants\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs migration changing, or are the depictions of migration changing?As can be seen from the discussion and key highlights above, there have been incremental changes in \\nmigration in recent years, such as in the overall scale of migration and displacement, although these changes \\ncould not be described as ﬁseismicﬂ. Rather, it would appear that there has been a deepening of existing \\npatterns of migration as opportunities brought about by economic growth and reform, trade liberalization \\nand long-term stability have been further realized. There is also a growing body of evidence indicating that \\nwhile the general notion of international migration may seem simple and straightforward Œ as depicted in \\n5news media, for example Œ its complexities are becoming more apparent.\\n13 The issue of how we conceptualize \\nmigration and mobility has long been a focus of many scholars and policymakers.\\n14 Recently, some are calling \\nfor a rethink, highlighting the growing anomalies resulting from a fairly ˚xed view of ﬁmigrationﬂ Œ see text \\nbox below on Professor Ronald Skeldon™s recent paper on the topic.\\nRethinking international migration, internal migration, mobility and urbanization\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n–\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n–\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe must recognize, however, that the increasing complexity of migration is, in part, also due to more \\ninformation on migration and migrants being available than ever before. We know more about who migrates, \\nwhy people migrate, where and how they migrate, although perhaps not to the extent we would prefer. But \\nit is clearer that the bigger issue of ﬁcomplexityﬂ applies to very many changes occurring globally. Some of \\nthe speci˚c ones, highlighted in the textbox below, have been intensively explored and analysed by experts \\nin Part II of this report.\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\n6Highlights from Part II: Complex and emerging migration issues\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7The unprecedented pace of change in the (geo)political, social, environmental and technological spheres has \\nled some analysts and commentators to coin or use phrases such as the ﬁage of accelerationsﬂ,\\n15 the ﬁfourth \\nindustrial revolutionﬂ,\\n16 and the ﬁage of changeﬂ.\\n17 There is wide recognition of how quickly the world is \\nchanging, and of how the pace of change seems to be accelerating beyond all expectations and predictions. \\nThere is also a sense that change is resulting in unexpected (and unwanted) impacts: \\nWe are living through an era of intense turbulence, disillusionment and bewilderment. \\nDeepening geopolitical tensions are transforming international relations, and political tribalism is revealing deep ˜ssures within countries. The spread of exponential technologies \\nis upending long-held assumptions about security, politics, economics and so much more.\\n18 Of particular note have been major shifts in the political realm, particularly in terms of civic engagement \\nthrough emerging social media and other online platforms as well as the standards of political leadership. \\nThe ﬁArab Springﬂ, for example, heralded a signi˚cant development in how voices were heard and activists \\norganized in political arenas.\\n19 More recently, we have seen a groundswell in analysis and commentary on \\nthe changes that are occurring in democratic systems around the world, and the implications for governance, \\ngeopolitics and international cooperation. We are living in a period in which the core values underpinning \\nglobal governance are being challenged. The values of equity, accountability, impartiality, fairness, justice and \\nprobity are being actively undermined as some political leaders disregard common interest in preference for \\npersonal interest Œ even if it corrodes laws, processes and institutions that have, overall, sought to advance \\nwhole nations and peoples, without excluding or expelling some because of their inherent characteristics or \\nbeliefs.\\n20 Ongoing and systematic corrosion, as we have witnessed throughout history, can extend to attacks \\non human rights and ultimately on groups of people within societies.\\n21As part of current shifts, international migration has increasingly become weaponized. It is being used by some \\nas a political tool, undermining democracy and inclusive civic engagement, by tapping into the understandable \\nfear in communities that stems from the accelerated pace of change and rising uncertainty of our times.\\n22 Some leaders seek to divide communities on the issue of migration, downplaying the signi˚cant bene˚ts \\nand enrichment migration brings and steadfastly ignoring our migration histories. And we are increasingly \\nwitnessing the harnessing of social media as a means of division and polarization, not just on migration, \\nbut at certain times we have seen the deployment of online ﬁtribal tacticsﬂ by activists attempting to depict \\nmigration in a negative and misleading light.\\n23 Underpinning these changing depictions of international \\nmigration is the uptake of technological innovation, particularly information and communications technology \\n(ICT). However, we must also recall that the politicization of migration is not new, as the text box below \\nhighlights.\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\n20\\n21\\n\\n22\\n23\\n\\n8The enduring issue of politics: Excerpt from the World Migration Report 2003\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na Technology as an enabler and a game-changer\\nMigration is intertwined with technology and innovation and there exists a large body of analysis that \\nhas assessed how international migration acts to support (and sometimes limit) the transfer of technology \\nand knowledge, often working in tandem with investment and trade ˜ows along historical, geographic and \\ngeopolitical connections between countries and communities.\\n24 Technology is increasingly critical throughout \\nthe migration process, especially newer forms of technology. In recent years, for example, we have witnessed \\nthe use of ICT by migrants to gather information and advice in real time during migration journeys; an issue \\nthat is raising interest and, at times, concern. The use of ICT, such as apps to share the latest information, \\nincluding to support clandestine border crossings, together with the consolidation of social media platforms \\nto connect geographically dispersed groups with common interests, has raised valid questions concerning the \\nextent to which technology has been used to support irregular migration, as well as to enable migrants to \\navoid abusive and exploitative migrant smugglers and human traf˚ckers.\\n25 Due to the ever-increasing access \\nto emerging technology at low cost, migrants have also developed applications to support better integration \\nin receiving countries, while maintaining social links and ˚nancial support to their families and societies \\nback home, including through the increasing prevalence of ﬁmobile moneyﬂ apps. \\nOther connections between migration and technology are also emerging in migration debates. As arti˚cial \\nintelligence is progressively taken up in key sectors, its consequences for migrant worker ˜ows and domestic \\nlabour markets are areas of intense focus for policymakers and businesses in origin and receiving countries.\\n26 24\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n9Recent discussions have also turned to blockchain technology and its consequences for migration, especially \\nfor remittances, but also for digital identities and global mobility.\\n27 Social media technology is also increasingly \\nimpacting the politics of migration, with a surge of far-right activism on social media platforms seeking to \\nin˜uence political debates and ultimately political decisions.\\n28 It is within this current context of great change and increasing uncertainty that the \\nWorld Migration Report \\n2020 seeks to draw upon the body of available data, research and analysis to contribute to a more nuanced \\nunderstanding of some of the most important and pressing global migration issues of our time. By their \\nvery nature, the complex dynamics of migration can never be fully measured, understood and regulated. \\nHowever, as this report shows, we do have a continuously growing and improving body of data and evidence \\nthat can help us make better sense of the basic features of migration and how they are changing Œ as well \\nas understanding how the context in which migration is occurring is evolving. This is increasingly important \\nas public debates, littered with misinformation and untruths, are increasingly able to utilize the ongoing \\nexpansion of open ﬁnew mediaﬂ platforms to achieve distortion and misrepresentation of migration and \\nmigrants.\\nThe World Migration Report series\\nThe ˚rst World Migration Report was published 20 years ago, initially as a one-off report designed to increase \\nthe understanding of migration by policymakers and the general public. It was conceived at a time when \\nthe effects of globalization were being felt in many parts of the world and in a multitude of ways. Indeed, \\nthe ˚rst World Migration Report states that part of its genesis was due to the effects of globalization on \\nmigration patterns, and that the report therefore ﬁlooks at the increasingly global economy which has led to \\nan unprecedented in˜ux of newcomers in many countries–ﬂ.\\n29 The report highlighted the fact that, despite \\nbeing an ﬁage-old phenomenonﬂ, migration was accelerating as part of broader globalization transformations \\nof economic and trade processes, which were enabling greater movement of labour as well as goods and \\ncapital. Table 1 below provides a summary of key statistics reported in the \\nWorld Migration Report 2000\\n, as compared to this current edition. It shows that while some aspects have stayed fairly constant Œ the \\nproportion of female international migrants as well as the overall proportion of the world™s population who \\nwere migrants Œ other aspects have changed dramatically. International remittances, for example, have grown \\nfrom an estimated 126 billion in 2000 to 689 billion in 2020, underscoring the salience of international \\nmigration as a driver of development. This helps to partly explain the emergence of migration as a ˚rst-tier \\nglobal issue that has seen United Nations Member States take a series of steps to strengthen global governance \\nof migration, most notably since 2000 (see chapter 11 of this report for discussion). It is unsurprising then \\nthat the International Organization for Migration (IOM) itself has grown in size, with a signi˚cant increase \\nin membership over the last two decades up from 76 to its current membership of 173 States. Also of note \\nin table 1 is the rise in international migrants globally (up around 85%) as well as of refugees (up around \\n80%) and internally displaced (up around 97%); all the while remaining very small proportions of the world™s \\npopulation. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n120436+Sources:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nNotes:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n+\\n\\nThe \\nWorld Migration Report 2000\\n™s contribution to migration policy as well as migration studies was timely, \\nand its success heralded the World Migration Report series. Since 2000, ten World Migration Reports have \\nbeen produced by IOM (see text box below) and it has become the organization™s ˜agship publication series. \\nIts continued strong focus is on making a relevant, sound and evidence-based contribution that increases the \\nunderstanding of migration by policymakers, practitioners, researchers and the general public. \\nIn late 2016, IOM made the decision to re˚ne the World Migration Report series in order to ensure it was able \\nto maximize its contribution to fact-based knowledge on migration globally. Each edition of the series now \\nhas two parts comprising:\\nŁ Part I: Key information on migration and migrants (including migration-related statistics);\\nŁ Part II: Balanced, evidence-based analysis of complex and emerging migration issues.\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe move away from single theme editions of the report series to this two-part structure was in recognition of \\nthe signi˚cant changes in migration research, analysis and publishing, as well as the different expectations \\nand needs of readers. For those who want to ˚nd out about key migration facts and ˚gures, Part I brings \\ntogether the latest information and statistics so that readers are able to better understand migration trends, \\nchanging patterns and processes at the global and regional levels. But for those who may be working on (or \\nstudying) speci˚c areas of migration policy or practice, deeper dives into the complexities are offered in \\nPart II. Re˚nement of the series was also in recognition that, as the focus on, and complexity of, migration \\nintensi˚es, reports limited to a single theme have the potential to understate or miss entirely the broader \\nchanges that are occurring in migration transformations globally. \\nA further consideration of the revised series was its intended ﬁvalue-addﬂ. As an intergovernmental \\norganization, and a new United Nations related organization, it is critical that IOM ensures the World \\nMigration Report serves the public in providing information and analysis that is relevant, accessible, sound, \\naccurate and balanced. The need to avoid duplication or signi˚cant overlap is a genuine one, especially \\nin light of newer contributions on migration governance (such as the Migration Governance Indicators). \\nIn this way, the World Migration Report series was re-framed to offer strategic analysis of complex and \\nemerging issues facing migration policymakers, rather than describe or assess current policy and governance \\non migration. The series complements rather than duplicates other work. \\nEvidence indicates that the revised series has been successful in achieving its intended aims, with positive \\nresponses from readers, including Member States, migration academics and general readers. The signi˚cant, \\nsustained increase in downloads during 2018 and (to date) 2019 of the \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n over \\nprevious editions is another encouraging indicator.\\n30 30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12World Migration Report 2020 \\nThis edition, heralding the twentieth anniversary of the World Migration Report series, builds on the previous \\nreport, the 2018 edition, by providing updated migration statistics at the global and regional levels as well \\nas descriptive analysis of complex migration issues. \\nPart I, on ﬁkey data and information on migration and migrantsﬂ, includes separate chapters on global migration \\ntrends and patterns; regional dimensions and developments; and a discussion of recent contributions to \\nmigration research and analysis by academia and a wide range of different organizations, including IOM. These \\nthree chapters have been produced institutionally by IOM, drawing primarily on analyses by IOM experts, \\npractitioners and of˚cials around the world based on data from a wide range of relevant organizations. The \\nseven chapters in Part II are authored by applied and academic researchers working on migration. They cover \\na range of ﬁcomplex and emerging migration issuesﬂ including: \\nŁ migrants™ contributions to societies; \\nŁ migration, inclusion and social cohesion; \\nŁ migration and health; \\nŁ children and unsafe migration; \\nŁ migration and adaptation to environmental change; \\nŁ migrants caught in crises; and \\nŁ recent developments in global migration governance. \\nWhile the choice of these topics is necessarily selective and subjective, all the chapters in Part II of this \\nreport are directly relevant to some of the most prominent and important debates about migration in the \\nworld today. Many of these topics lie at the heart of the conundrums that face policymakers as they seek \\nto formulate effective, proportionate and constructive responses to complex public policy issues related to \\nmigration. Accordingly, the chapters aim to inform current and future policy deliberations and discussions \\nby providing a clear identi˚cation of the key issues, a critical overview of relevant research and analysis, \\nand a discussion of the implications for future research and policymaking. The chapters are not meant to be \\nprescriptive, in the sense of advocating particular policy ﬁsolutionsﬂ Œ especially as the immediate context is \\nan important determinant of policy settings Œ but informative and helpful to what can be highly contested \\ndebates. \\nPart IChapter 2 provides an overview of global data and trends on international migrants (stocks) and international \\nmigration (˜ows). It also provides a discussion of particular migrant groups Œ namely, migrant workers, \\nrefugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced persons and stateless persons Œ as well as of remittances. In \\naddition, the chapter refers to the existing body of IOM programmatic data, particularly on missing migrants, \\nassisted voluntary returns and reintegration, resettlement, displacement tracking and human traf˚cking. \\nWhile these data are generally not global or representative, they can provide insights into changes that have \\noccurred in relevant IOM programming and operations globally. \\n13Following the global overview, chapter 3 provides a discussion of key regional dimensions of, and developments \\nin, migration. The discussion focuses on six world regions as identi˚ed by the United Nations Department \\nof Economic and Social Affairs: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Northern America, \\nand Oceania. For each of these regions, the analysis includes: i) an overview and brief discussion of key \\npopulation-related statistics; and ii) succinct descriptions of ﬁkey features and developmentsﬂ in migration \\nin the region, based on a wide range of data, information and analyses, including from international \\norganizations, researchers and analysts. To account for the diversity of migration patterns, trends and issues \\nwithin each of the six regions, descriptive narratives of ﬁkey features and recent developmentsﬂ are presented \\nat the subregional level. \\nThere is a substantial amount of research and analysis on migration that is being undertaken and published \\nby a range of actors such as academics, governments, intergovernmental organizations and think tanks. \\nChapter 4 provides a selective overview of such contributions, updating the chapter on the topic as it ˚rst \\nappeared in the \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n. The overview focuses on migration research outputs published \\nby academia and intergovernmental organizations in 2017 and 2018, which saw a peak in output from \\nintergovernmental organizations, some of which was produced to inform States and other actors during \\ndeliberations on the Global Compact for Migration (see chapter 11 of this report for discussion of the compact \\nprocesses and outcome).\\nPart IIThe lead chapter in Part II examines the historical and contemporary contributions of migrants to communities \\nof destination as well as those back in their place of origin. With this perspective, it focuses on three \\ncentral domains of migrants™ contributions: sociocultural, civic-political and economic. In the face of often \\nnegatively skewed discussions on migration and migrants, one can lose sight of the fact that migrants \\nhave made signi˚cant contributions in a multitude of ways. This ﬁreality checkﬂ chapter 5 highlights an \\noften overlooked but important topic, placing the analysis in the context of emerging impediments to the \\nrecognition of migrants™ contributions globally. The chapter concludes by outlining the implications for policy \\ndeliberations and for further research. \\nChapter 6 critically reviews the issue of inclusion of migrants in host societies where they adapt to new \\ncultures, customs, social values and language. The chapter provides an overview of the historical development \\nof the policy approaches and terminology related to the topic. It discusses the roles of different stakeholders \\nin optimizing the inclusion of migrants, as well as the importance of policy settings that are directly and \\nindirectly related to inclusion. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the implication for policy responses.\\nHealth and migration is often only thought about in crisis terms, but there is much more to the connections \\nbetween the two. Chapter 7 provides an overview analysis of key issues related to health and migration, \\nincluding in terms of bene˚ts, vulnerabilities and resilience. The chapter then examines health systems™ \\nresponses and prevailing approaches, as well as gaps in the governance of migration and health. Lessons from \\ngood-practice guidelines and the global agendas in migration and health are provided.\\nChapter 8 deals with child migration that does not conform to the traditional pattern of the migrant child \\naccompanying or following the family in a safe environment, but rather migration that is unsafe, for example, \\noccurring through irregular pathways without family. Following an expository approach, the chapter elaborates \\ndifferent types of child migration, their drivers, and issues related to the data on child migration. It discusses \\n14key protection challenges affecting child migrants and addresses the current issues and the evolving policies \\nto handle them. The chapter explores the main emerging challenges confronting child migrants and concludes \\nby re˜ecting on policy and research priorities.\\nProviding an overview of human mobility and adaptation to cope with environmental and climate change, \\nchapter 9 explores empirical research from around the world. Diverse examples of adaptive behaviour are \\npresented from different ecological zones particularly at risk under climate change, namely, mountainous, \\ndryland and coastal areas, as well as cities. The examples address a variety of strategies that promote one \\nor several adaptive forms of migration. The chapter also provides a summary of the international policy \\nframeworks on responses to the mobility aspects of environmental and climate change. The chapter concludes \\nwith focused recommendations for research, policy and practice.\\nChapter 10 deals with crises that migrants are caught up in. Presenting examples of such crises like ˜oods, \\nhurricanes, con˜icts, and political and economic crisis, it examines current emergency assistance and urgent \\nprotection responses. The chapter provides an overview of the local, national and international responses \\nto such needs faced by different types of migrants and their effectiveness. By drawing on the Migrants in \\nCountries in Crisis Initiative, it examines the varying contexts, responses, gaps, and lessons learned in crisis \\npreparedness and post-crisis recovery.

Understanding changes in scale, \\nemerging trends and shifting demographics related to global social and economic transformations, such as \\nmigration, help us make sense of the changing world we live in and plan for the future. The current global \\nestimate is that there were around 272 million international migrants in the world in 2019, which equates to \\n3.5 per cent of the global population.\\n1 A ˚rst important point to note is that this is a very small minority of \\nthe world™s population, meaning that staying within one™s country of birth overwhelmingly remains the norm. \\nThe great majority of people do not migrate across borders; much larger numbers migrate within countries \\n(an estimated 740 million internal migrants in 2009).\\n2 That said, the increase in international migrants has \\nbeen evident over time Œ both numerically and proportionally Œ and at a slightly faster rate than previously \\nanticipated.\\n3The overwhelming majority of people migrate internationally for reasons related to work, family and study \\nŒ involving migration processes that largely occur without fundamentally challenging either migrants or the \\ncountries they enter. In contrast, other people leave their homes and countries for a range of compelling and \\nsometimes tragic reasons, such as con˜ict, persecution and disaster. While those who have been displaced, \\nsuch as refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), comprise a relatively small percentage of all migrants, \\nthey are often the most in need of assistance and support. \\nThis chapter, with its focus on key global migration data and trends, seeks to assist migration policymakers, \\npractitioners and researchers in making better sense of the bigger picture of migration, by providing an \\noverview of information on migration and migrants. The chapter draws upon current statistical sources \\ncompiled by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), the Organisation for \\nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the World \\nBank, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Internal Displacement Monitoring \\nCentre (IDMC) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\\n4 The chapter provides an overview of \\nglobal data and trends on international migrants (stocks) and international migration (˜ows). It also provides \\na discussion of particular migrant groups Œ namely, migrant workers, refugees, asylum seekers, IDPs and \\nmissing migrants Œ as well as of stateless persons and remittances. \\nThe chapter also refers to the growing body of programmatic IOM data, particularly on assisted voluntary \\nreturns and reintegration, resettlement, displacement tracking and victims of human traf˚cking. While these \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 2 Œ \\n20data are generally not global or representative, they can provide insights into changes that have occurred \\nin relevant programming and operations globally. As the United Nations migration agency, with activities \\nrelevant to all the themes discussed in this chapter, IOM data have the capacity to provide further insights \\non migration and its various dynamics, including the diverse needs of migrants. \\nThis chapter highlights some of the challenges associated with data collection and de˚nitions that make a \\ncomprehensive analysis of migration trends at the global level dif˚cult.\\n5 This also remains an issue for many \\nStates attempting to analyse migration trends within their own countries or regions, as re˜ected in the \\nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, with its emphasis on data collection for evidence-\\nbased policy (Objective 1 of the Global Compact Œ see discussion in chapter 11 of this report). Ongoing efforts \\nto collect and improve migration statistics have led to an expansion in available data; however, the need for \\nfurther technical capacity is an obstacle that is yet to be overcome as the international community works to \\ndevelop a more comprehensive global picture of key aspects of migration. Similarly, de˚ning migration and \\nmigrants is complex, as discussed in the text box below. \\nDefining migration, migrant and other key terms\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n21International migrants: numbers and trendsUN DESA produces estimates of the number of international migrants globally. The following discussion draws \\non its estimates, which are based on data provided by States.\\n6 The United Nations \\nRecommendations on Statistics of International Migration\\n de˚nes an ﬁinternational \\nmigrantﬂ as any person who has changed his or her country of usual residence, distinguishing between \\nﬁshort-term migrantsﬂ (those who have changed their countries of usual residence for at least three months, \\nbut less than one year) and ﬁlong-term migrantsﬂ (those who have done so for at least one year). However, \\nnot all countries use this de˚nition in practice.\\n7 Some countries use different criteria to identify international \\nmigrants by, for example, applying different minimum durations of residence. Differences in concepts and \\nde˚nitions, as well as data collection methodologies between countries, hinder full comparability of national \\nstatistics on international migrants. \\nOverall, the estimated number of international migrants has increased over the past ˚ve decades. The total \\nestimated 272 million people living in a country other than their countries of birth in 2019 was 119 million \\nmore than in 1990 (when it was 153 million), and over three times the estimated number in 1970 (84 million; \\nsee table 1).  While the proportion of international migrants globally has also increased over this period, it is \\nevident that the vast majority of people continue to live in the countries in which they were born. \\n\\n\\n\\nYear\\n\\n\\n \\n1990199520002005201020152019Source: \\n \\nNote: \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2019, most international migrants (around 74%) were of working age (20 to 64 years of age), with a slight \\ndecrease in migrants younger than 20 years old from 2000 to 2019 (from 16.4% to 14%), and a constant share \\n(around 12%) of international migrants 65 years of age and older since 2000.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n22Snapshot of international migrants\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n272Million258Million249Million221Million192Million174Million1995200020052010201520192.8%2.9%3.2%3.4%3.4%3.5%2.7%3.6%4.8%5.5%7.5%8.8%10.0%11.0%11.2%10.1%7.1%4.3%3.4%3.3%2.8%3.4%4.3%5.3%5.6%7.2%8.2%9.2%10.1%10.4%9.6%6.9%4.4%3.5%3.3%2.8%70Œ7465Œ6960Œ6455Œ5950Œ5445Œ4940Œ4435Œ3930Œ2425Œ2920Œ2415Œ1910Œ145Œ90Œ452% \\n male, 48% are \\nfemale\\n\\nŒ\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCCanada 21.3%Sweden\\n 20.0%Qatar\\n 78.7%Singapore\\n 37.1%South Africa\\n 7.2%Note:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nNote: \\n \\n\\n\\n24In 2019, Europe and Asia each hosted around 82 million and 84 million international migrants, respectively   \\nŒ comprising 61\\n per cent of the total global international migrant stock combined (see ˚gure 1).

Some origin countries have high proportions of their nationals living abroad for economic, \\npolitical, security, trade or cultural reasons that may be contemporary or historical in nature.  For example, \\nthe Syrian Arab Republic has a higher rate of emigration than most other countries due to displacement caused \\nby long-term con˜ict (see discussion below on refugees for more detail). Figure 4 highlights countries with \\nhigh proportions of emigrants in 2019.  Importantly, the emigration proportion of a country represents an \\naccumulation of migration (and displacement) over time, sometimes many decades. Of note is the geographic \\ndiversity of the countries in ˚gure 4 (countries from all regions except Northern America are included) as well \\nas the high number of countries from Latin America and the Caribbean (10 of the 20 countries).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n \\nNotes:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n28UN DESA estimates of foreign-born populations do not re˜ect immigration status or policy categories (such as \\nstudents, highly skilled migrants, or refugees). Capturing such attributes is inherently dif˚cult for several key \\nreasons. First, a person™s immigration status can be ˜uid and change quickly, arising from circumstances and \\nlegal/policy settings. For example, many international migrants who may be described as ‚‚undocumentedﬂ \\nor ﬁirregularﬂ enter countries on valid visas and then stay in contravention of one or more visa conditions. \\nIn fact, there are many paths to irregularity, such as crossing borders without authorization, unlawfully \\noverstaying a visa period, working in contravention of visa conditions, being born into irregularity, or \\nremaining after a negative decision on an asylum application has been made.\\n19 Second, countries have different immigration policy settings and different ways of collecting data on migrants, \\nwhich makes it dif˚cult to establish a harmonized approach to capturing irregular migrant stocks globally. \\nThe pace of change in the migration policy arena also poses an extra dimension of complexity, as people \\nmay slip into and out of ﬁirregularityﬂ. Notably, there have been very few global estimates of the number \\nof irregular migrants because of this complexity. However, this has not prevented some organizations from \\ncoming up with in˜ated and incorrect global estimatesŠsee text box below on ﬁwhat not to doﬂ.\\nWhat not to do: estimating the global population of irregular migrants\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThird, as noted in the text box earlier on the chapter on ﬁde˚ning migration, migrant and other key termsﬂ, \\nthere necessarily exist different de˚nitions, depending on the circumstances in which they are applied. In \\nsome legal/policy situations, as well as in general discussions, for example, a ﬁmigrantﬂ can include a person \\nwho has \\nnever migrated\\n.

Available UN DESA estimates on global migrant stocks are extensive and global in scope; however, the \\ndatabase of migration ˜ows only encompasses 45 countries.\\n20 Capturing data on migration ˜ows is extremely \\nchallenging for several reasons. First, while international migration ˜ows are generally accepted as covering \\nin˜ows and out˜ows into and from countries, there has been a greater focus on recording in˜ows. For \\nexample, while countries such as Australia and the United States count cross-border movements, many others \\nonly count entries and not departures.\\n21 Additionally, migration ˜ow data in some countries are derived from \\nadministrative events related to immigration status (for example, issuance/renewal/withdrawal of a residence \\npermit) and are thus used as a proxy for migration ˜ows. Furthermore, migratory movements are often hard \\nto separate from non-migratory travel, such as tourism or business.\\n22 Tracking migratory movements also \\nrequires considerable resources, infrastructure and IT/knowledge systems. This poses particular challenges for \\ndeveloping countries, where the ability to collect, administer, analyse and report data on mobility, migration \\nand other areas is often limited. Finally, many countries™ physical geographies pose tremendous challenges \\nfor collecting data on migration ˜ows. Entry and border management, for example, is particularly challenging \\nin some regions, because of archipelagic and isolated borders, and it is further complicated by traditions of \\ninformal migration for work.\\n2320\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n\\n30IOM™s Global Migration Data Portal \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n31Migration flows \\nThere are currently two main international datasets on international migration ˜ows, both of which are \\nderived from national statistics: UN DESA™s International Migration Flows dataset and OECD™s International \\nMigration Database. Since 2005, UN DESA has compiled data on the ˜ows of international migrants to and \\nfrom selected countries, based on nationally available statistics. At the time of writing (August 2019), there \\nhad been no update to the UN DESA ˜ows dataset, with the most current being the 2015 version. The 2015 \\nmigration ˜ows dataset comprises data from 45 countries (only 43 on emigration ˜ows), up from 29 countries \\nin 2008 and 15 countries in 2005.\\n24 The OECD data on migration ˜ows have been collected since 2000, which allows for limited trend analysis, \\nas shown in ˚gure 5 (though data are not standardized, as explained in the note under the ˚gure).\\n25 The \\nestimates suggest that permanent migration in˜ows to OECD countries increased from 3.85 million in 2000 to \\n7.06 million in 2016, with a temporary lull occurring around the time of the global ˚nancial crisis (˚gure\\n 5). \\nGermany remained the main OECD destination country in 2016, with over 1.7 million new international \\nmigrants (more than double the levels registered in 2000, but with a decrease compared with more than \\n2 million in 2015) arriving that year, followed by the United States (nearly 1.2 million) and the United \\nKingdom (about 450,000 new migrants).\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 01234567820162015201420132012201120102009200820072006200520042003200220012000millionsSource: \\n \\nNotes:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n32Migrant fatalities and IOM™s Missing Migrants Project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n33Migrant workersThe latest available estimates indicate that there were roughly 164 million migrant workers around the \\nworld in 2017, accounting for nearly two thirds (64%) of the (then) 258 million global stock of international \\nmigrants.\\n27 When compared with the global population of international migrants of working age Œ regarded \\nas 15 years of age or older (234 million) Œ migrant workers account for 70\\n per cent. For a range of reasons, \\nhowever, these global ˚gures are likely to be underestimates.\\n28 While earlier global estimates of migrant \\nworkers have been produced, ILO notes that these cannot be compared with 2017 ˚gures, due to de˚nitional \\ndifferences and changes in methodology and data sources. \\nIn 2017, 68 per cent of migrant workers were residing in high-income level countries Œ an estimated \\n111 million people. An additional 47 million migrant workers (29%) were living in middle-income countries, \\nand 5.6 million (3.4%) were in low-income countries. While we are unable to compare the numbers of migrant \\nworkers over time, it is useful to examine changes in proportional distribution. In 2017, for example, there \\nwas a noticeable change in destination country category; that is, from 2013 to 2017, high-income countries \\nexperienced a 7 percentage point drop in migrant workers (from 75% to 68%), while upper-middle-income \\ncountries observed a 7 percentage point increase (from 12% to 19%) (see ˚gure 6). This apparent shift may be \\nin˜uenced by economic growth in middle-income countries and/or changes to labour immigration regulations \\nin high-income countries. The share of migrant workers in the total workforce across country income groups \\nwas quite small in low-income (1.9%), lower-income (1.4%) and upper-middle-income countries (2.2%), but \\nmuch greater for high-income countries (18.5%). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0102030405060708020172013High income\\nUpper-middle income\\nLower-middle income\\nLow income \\nPercentage\\nSource:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n34Male migrant workers outnumbered female migrant workers by 28 million in 2017, with 96 million males \\n(58%) and 68 million females (42%), in a context where males comprised a higher number of international \\nmigrants of working age (127 million or 54%, compared with 107 million or 46% females).

Consistent with this trend, \\nremittances to low- and middle-income countries (which account for the majority of the global total) had \\ndeclined for two consecutive years, from 2014 to 2016 Œ a trend that had not been seen for three decades, \\naccording to the World Bank, before returning back to the positive long-term trend from 2016 to 2018 \\n(from USD 444 billion in 2016, to USD 483 billion in 2017, and USD 529 billion in 2018). Since the mid-\\n1990s, remittances have greatly surpassed of˚cial development assistance levels,\\n34 de˚ned as government aid \\ndesigned to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries.\\n35 In 2018, India, China, Mexico, the Philippines and Egypt were (in descending order) the top ˚ve remittance-\\nrecipient countries, although India and China were well above the rest, with total inward remittances \\nexceeding USD\\n 67 billion for each country (see table 3). When remittances are viewed as a percentage of \\ngross domestic product, however, the top ˚ve remittance-receiving countries in 2018 were Tonga (at 35.2%), \\nfollowed by Kyrgyzstan (33.6%), Tajikistan (31%), Haiti (30.7%) and Nepal (28%). \\nHigh-income countries are almost always the main source of remittances.

In 2018, approximately 2.1 million asylum claims were \\nlodged with States or UNHCR. Of the roughly 1.7 million ˚rst-instance applications for asylum lodged in 2018, \\nthe United States was the top recipient of asylum claims, with 254,300 new asylum applications, a 23\\n per cent \\ndecrease from 2017 (331,700), contrasting with the previous trend of increasing asylum applications in the \\nUnited States from 2013 to 2016. Peru was the second largest recipient, with a sharp increase of asylum \\napplications, from 37,800 new asylum claims in 2017 to 192,500 in 2018, mainly lodged by Venezuelans \\n(190,500). Peru was followed by Germany, where the number of asylum applications continued to decrease \\n(722,400 in 2016, down to 198,300 in 2017 and 161,900 in 2018). \\nUNHCR estimates that, at the end of 2018, those under 18 years of age constituted roughly 52\\n per cent of \\nthe global refugee population. From 2003 to 2018, according to available disaggregated data, the proportion \\nof children among stocks of refugees was very high, ˜uctuating between 41 and 52\\n per cent. The proportion \\nof females has remained relatively stable, at 47 to 49\\n per cent, over the same period. Consistent with broader \\nglobal dynamics, refugees continued to be primarily based in urban settings, with about 61\\n per cent of \\nrefugees located in urban areas at the end of 2018.\\n38Unaccompanied and separated children lodged an estimated 27,600 individual asylum applications in at \\nleast 60 countries in 2018, marking a continued declining trend since the exceptionally high number of \\napplications in 2015 (98,400).\\n39 As in other years, unresolved or renewed con˜ict dynamics in key countries contributed signi˚cantly to \\ncurrent ˚gures and trends. Of the refugees under UNHCR™s mandate at the end of 2018, the top 10 countries \\nof origin Œ the Syrian Arab Republic, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, the Democratic \\nRepublic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Eritrea and Burundi Œ accounted for roughly 16.6 million, \\nor 82 per cent of the total refugee population. Many of these countries have been among the top sources of \\nrefugees for at least seven years. The ongoing con˜ict in the Syrian Arab Republic saw the number of refugees \\nfrom that country reach approximately 6.7 million. The instability and violence that have made Afghanistan \\na major source of refugees for over 30 years have continued, with the country being the second largest origin \\ncountry in the world, with 2.7 million refugees; this is a slight increase from 2017 ˚gures (2.6 million), \\nlargely due to births during that year.

Turkey, which naturalized an \\nestimated 29,000 refugees from the Syrian Arab Republic in 2018 (compared with 50,000 in 2017), represents \\nthe greatest proportion, with Canada, the Netherlands, Guinea-Bissau and France contributing the bulk of \\nthe rest.\\nThe traditional resettlement countries of Canada, the United States of America and Australia continued to \\nconduct the majority of the world™s refugee resettlements.

This statistical \\ninformation is categorized by two broad displacement causes: (a) disasters, and (b) con˜ict and violence. \\nHowever, IDMC acknowledges the challenges associated with distinguishing between disasters and con˜ict as \\nthe immediate cause of displacement, and highlights the growing need to identify better ways to report on \\ndisplacement in the context of multiple drivers.\\n43 With an estimated 41.3 million, the total global stock of people internally displaced by con˜ict and violence \\nat the end of 2018 was the highest on record since IDMC began monitoring in 1998, and represents an \\nincrease from the 40 million reported in 2017. As with trends for refugees (discussed in the previous section), \\nintractable and new con˜icts have meant that the total number of persons internally displaced by con˜ict \\nand violence has almost doubled since 2000, and has risen sharply since 2010. \\nFigure 11 shows the world™s top 20 countries with the largest number of IDPs displaced due to con˜ict and \\nviolence (stock) at the end of 2018. Most countries were either in the Middle East or sub-Saharan Africa. \\nThe Syrian Arab Republic had the highest number of people displaced due to con˜ict (6.1 million) by the \\nend of 2018, followed by Colombia (5.8 million). The Democratic Republic of the Congo had the third largest \\nnumber with 3.1 million, followed by Somalia (2.6 million) and Afghanistan (2.6 million). Over 30 million \\n(nearly 75%) of the global total of 41.3 million people displaced live in just 10 countries.\\n44 In terms of \\nproportion of national population, the Syrian Arab Republic, whose con˜ict has dragged on for several \\nyears, had over 30\\n per cent of its population displaced due to con˜ict and violence. Somalia had the second \\nhighest proportion (18%), followed by the Central African Republic and Colombia (with both over 10%). It \\nis important to note, however, that especially for protracted displacement cases, such as in Colombia, some \\n43\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n44\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n44people who have returned to their places of origin and to their homes may still be counted as internally \\ndisplaced. This is because, in some cases, a durable solution has not been achieved.\\n45 Organizations such as \\nIDMC follow the Inter-Agency Standing Committee™s framework on ﬁDurable Solutions for Internally Displaced \\nPersonsﬂ, which stipulates eight criteria that constitute a durable solution in determining when people \\nshould no longer be considered internally displaced.\\n46 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nmillions | per cent\\nSyrian Arab Republic\\nColombia\\n\\nSomalia\\nYemen\\n\\n\\nSudanIraq\\nTurkey\\nUkraine\\nCameroon\\n\\nIndiaMyanmar\\nAzerbaijan\\nMexico\\n6 5 4 3 2 1 0 5 10 15 20 25 30\\nSource:\\n \\nNotes:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n45\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n45In 2018, for the ˚rst time, IDMC also provided an estimate of the global stock ˚gure of persons displaced by \\ndisasters. Slightly over 1.6 million persons were reported to be still living in displacement at the end of 2018 \\ndue to disasters that occurred in 2018. As noted by IDMC, this ˚gure is a ﬁhighly conservative estimateﬂ, as \\nit does not capture those living in displacement because of disasters that took place before 2018.  \\nNew displacements in 2018At the end of 2018, there were a total of 28 million new internal displacements across 148 countries and \\nterritories. Sixty-one\\n per cent (17.2 million) of these new displacements were triggered by disasters, and \\n39 per cent (10.8 million) were caused by con˜ict and violence. As in previous years, weather-related disasters \\ntriggered the vast majority of all new displacements, with storms accounting for 9.3 million displacements and \\n˜oods 5.4 million. The number of new displacements associated with con˜ict and violence almost doubled, \\nfrom 6.9 million in 2016 to 11.8 million in 2017, and slightly decreased, to 10.8 million, in 2018.\\n47 In 2018, Ethiopia topped the list with a signi˚cantly higher number of new displacements caused by con˜ict \\nand violence (2.9 million in 2018, compared with 725,000 in 2017), considerably in˜uencing global numbers \\nas a result.\\n48 Ethiopia was followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1.8 million) and the Syrian Arab \\nRepublic (1.6 million).\\nMany more people are newly displaced by disasters in any given year, compared with those newly displaced \\nby con˜ict and violence, and more countries are affected by disaster displacement. This is apparent when \\nexamining the number of countries and territories in which new displacements occurred in 2018: 144 for \\ndisasters, compared with 55 for con˜ict and violence. In 2018 (as in previous years), disasters triggered \\nby climate and weather-related hazards, such as storms and ˜oods, accounted for the bulk of the total \\n(16.1 million, or almost 94%). Information on displacements caused by droughts was also available and \\nobtained for the ˚rst time in 2017, with 1.3 million new displacements and, in 2018, 764,000, mostly in the \\nHorn of Africa. Since 2008, the other cause of disasters, geophysical hazards, has triggered an average of \\n3.1 million displacements per year. While 2017 statistics for geophysical disasters were well below average, \\nwith 758,000 new displacements recorded, the number increased to 1.1 million in 2018. The Philippines and \\nChina (approximately 3.8 million each), as well as India and the United States (respectively around 2.7 and \\n1.2 million), had the highest absolute numbers of disaster displacements in 2018. \\nAs shown in ˚gure 12, in previous years, annual new disaster displacements outnumbered new displacements \\nassociated with con˜ict and violence.

Indeed, while identifying who is stateless is a necessary ˚rst step \\ntowards preventing and reducing statelessness worldwide, data collection remains a signi˚cant challenge.\\n52 For the ˚rst time, UNHCR included Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and IDPs in Rakhine State, Myanmar, \\nin its 2017 and 2018 data of stateless persons, ﬁin light of the size of this population and that they are \\nin fact stateless as well as displacedﬂ.\\n53 Bangladesh and Myanmar were the countries with the ˚rst and \\nthird largest populations of stateless persons, respectively, in 2018 (around 906,000 stateless persons in \\nBangladesh and 620,000 in Myanmar). Figure 13 shows the other countries in the top 10 as of 2018. Côte \\nd™Ivoire stood at the second position with 692,000 stateless persons, including mainly persons considered as \\nﬁforeignersﬂ after the country™s independence, as well as their descendants.\\n54 Thailand had the fourth largest \\npopulation of stateless persons in 2018, which consisted mostly of indigenous and ethnic communities.\\n55 Latvia reported almost 225,000 stateless persons, with a signi˚cant number of ethnic Russians who have not \\nbeen able to naturalize due to the country™s citizenship law after its independence from the Soviet Union, \\nwhich only grants nationality by descent.\\n56 It was followed by the Syrian Arab Republic (160,000), Kuwait \\n(92,000), Uzbekistan (80,000), Estonia (78,000) and the Russian Federation (76,000). In terms of proportion \\nof national populations, over 11\\n per cent of Latvia™s population was stateless, followed by Estonia, where \\nstateless persons amounted to nearly 6\\n per cent.\\n49\\n\\n50\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n52\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n54\\n55\\n\\n\\n56\\n\\n\\n48\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15105051015\\n\\nUzbekistan\\nKuwait\\nSyrian Arab Republic\\nLatvia\\nThailandMyanmar\\n\\nBangladesh\\n\\nSource: \\n \\nNotes:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, given current data gaps and methodological challenges, it is not feasible to provide trends \\nover time either of statelessness, or of the impact of current efforts to eradicate it.

Human migration may be an age-old phenomenon \\nthat stretches back to the earliest periods of history, but its manifestations and impacts have changed over \\ntime as the world has become more globalized. Now, more than at any other time in history, we have more \\ninformation on migration and displacement globally at our disposal. And yet, the very nature of migration in \\nan interconnected world means that its dynamism can be dif˚cult to capture in statistical terms. Migration \\ninvolves ﬁeventsﬂ that can be fast-paced and complex. While it is certainly true that international migration \\npatterns are related to social, economic and geopolitical processes that have evolved over generations, if \\nnot hundreds of years, recent advances in transnational connectivity are opening up more opportunities for \\ngreater diversity in migration processes.  \\nIt is increasingly relevant, therefore, to stay abreast of trends and evolving patterns in migration and \\ndisplacement. In this chapter, we have provided a global overview of migration and migrants, based on the \\ncurrent data available. Notwithstanding data gaps and lags, several high-level conclusions can be drawn. At \\nthe global level, for example, we can see that, over time, migrants have taken up residence in some regions \\n(such as Asia) at a much greater rate than others (such as Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean), and \\nthat this trend is likely to continue (see ˚gure 1). Likewise, statistics show that migrant workers continue to \\ngravitate toward regions with greater opportunities, as economies grow and labour markets evolve, and that \\nsome migrant worker populations are heavily gendered (see ˚gure 7).\\n51The global data also show that displacement caused by con˜ict, generalized violence and other factors \\nremains at a record high. Intractable, unresolved and recurring con˜icts and violence have led to an \\nupsurge in the number of refugees around the world in recent years, with women and children comprising \\na substantial portion of the total. While a handful of countries continue to provide solutions for refugees, \\noverall, these have been insuf˚cient to address global needs, especially given the recent change in refugee \\nresettlement patterns to the United States (see ˚gure 10). In addition, there were estimated to be more \\npeople displaced internally at the end of 2018 than ever before. We also ˚nd that the estimated number of \\nstateless persons globally is signi˚cant, at almost 4 million, notwithstanding that it has been cautioned that \\nthis is an underestimate. Aside from fundamental human rights issues, statelessness can place people at risk \\nof (irregular) migration and displacement, so it is an important global issue worthy of further data collection, \\nreporting and analysis.\\n58 International cooperation on migration has been recognized by a signi˚cant majority of States Œ along with \\nnon-State actors in migration Œ as essential and central to achieving safe, orderly and regular migration \\nfor all. The Global Compact for Migration makes this clear, emphasizing a global commitment to improving \\ninternational cooperation on migration, as well as the collection of migration data, so that we may better \\nunderstand trends and evolving patterns and processes, to support the development of evidence-based \\nresponses.\\n59 There are opportunities to be realized as well as challenges to be overcome, as we work collectively \\ntoward implementation of this commitment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n59\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n533MIGRATION AND MIGRANTS: REGIONAL \\nDIMENSIONS AND DEVELOPMENTSIntroductionThe previous chapter provides an overview of migration globally, with speci˚c reference to international stocks \\nand ˜ows. Particular migrant groups Œ including migrant workers, refugees, asylum seekers and internally \\ndisplaced persons (IDPs) Œ as well as remittances, were outlined. Chapter 3 focuses primarily at the regional \\nlevel in order to provide a more detailed picture of migration, which sets out a different, but complementary, \\nperspective of migrants and movements in different parts of the world.\\n1Our starting point is geographic, rather than thematic, given that geography is one of the fundamentals \\nunderpinning migration today, just as it was in the past. Notwithstanding increasing globalization, geography \\nis one of the most signi˚cant factors shaping patterns of migration and displacement. Many people who \\nmigrate across borders do so within their immediate regions, to countries that are close by, countries to which \\nit may be easier to travel, that may be more familiar, and from which it may also be easier to return. For \\npeople who are displaced, ˚nding safety quickly is paramount. People, therefore, tend to be displaced to safer \\nlocations nearby, whether that is within their own countries or across international borders. \\nThis chapter seeks to assist migration policymakers, practitioners and researchers to make better sense of \\ninternational migration globally by using a geographic perspective to present regional migration overviews. \\nThe analysis in this chapter focuses on six world regions as de˚ned by the United Nations, and used by the \\nUnited Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and other organizations:\\nŁ AfricaŁ Asia\\nŁ Europe\\nŁ Latin America and the Caribbean\\nŁ Northern America\\nŁ OceaniaFor each of these regions, the analysis includes: (a) an overview and brief discussion of key migration \\nstatistics based on data compiled and reported by UN DESA, the United Nations High Commissioner for \\nRefugees (UNHCR) and the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC); and (b) succinct descriptions of \\nﬁkey features and developmentsﬂ in migration in the region, based on a wide range of data, information and \\nanalyses from international organizations, researchers and analysts. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 3 Œ \\n54To account for the diversity of migration patterns, trends and issues within each of the six regions, the \\ndescriptive narratives of ﬁkey features and recent developmentsﬂ are presented at the subregional level. \\nFor Asia, for example, this cascade approach allows for the presentation of insights from statistical data on \\nAsia as a whole, followed by summary information on subregions, including Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, \\nSouth-East Asia, the Middle East and Central Asia. A breakdown of the regions and subregions is provided \\nin appendix A. These subregional overviews provide information on migration patterns from, within and to \\nthe subregions.\\n2 Beyond this, attention has been paid to particular features that exist in a subregion, such \\nas labour migration and remittances, irregular migration, human traf˚cking, displacement (internal and \\ninternational) and integration. The subregional overviews are not intended to be exhaustive, but are designed \\nto be illustrative of key trends and recent changes in migration.\\nIt is important to note that this chapter builds on chapter 3 of the \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n, Migration \\nand migrants: Regional dimensions and developments, by providing an update on statistics and current \\nissues. Importantly, it has been produced as a stand-alone chapter and does not require readers to refer back \\nto the previous report.\\n3 Signi˚cant changes over the two years since the last report have been re˜ected in this \\nchapter, which incorporates data and information up until the end of June 2019. Recent shifts in migration \\nand displacement Œ such as the large-scale movement through South and Central America from the Bolivarian \\nRepublic of Venezuela Œ are discussed, as is the mass displacement of Rohingya from Myanmar™s Rakhine State \\nin the second half of 2017. The chapter draws on the existing evidence base, and sources are provided in \\nfootnotes and the references section. We encourage readers to refer to sources cited in this chapter to learn \\nmore about topics of interest.\\nAfrica4Migration in Africa involves large numbers of migrants moving both within and from the region. As shown \\nin ˚gure 1, in 2019, over 21 million Africans were living in another African country, a signi˚cant increase \\nfrom 2015, when around 18.5 million Africans were estimated to be living within the region. The number \\nof Africans living in different regions also grew during the same period, from around 17 million in 2015 to \\nnearly 19 million in 2019. \\nFigure 1 shows that, since 2000, international migration within the African region has increased signi˚cantly. \\nAnd since 1990, the number of African migrants living outside of the region has more than doubled, with \\nthe growth to Europe most pronounced. In 2019, most African-born migrants living outside the region were \\nresiding in Europe (10.6 million), Asia (4.6 million) and Northern America (3.2 million).\\nOne of the most striking aspects to note about international migrants in Africa, as shown in ˚gure 1, is the \\nsmall number of migrants who were born outside of the region and have since moved there. From 2015 to \\n2019, the number of migrants born outside the region remained virtually unchanged (around 2 million), most \\nof whom were from Asia and Europe.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n55\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMigrants to Africa\\nMigrants within Africa\\nMigrants from Africa\\n199019952000200520102015 2019199019952000200520102015 2019199019952000200520102015 201905101520YearMigrant Stock (millions)RegionAfrica\\nAsiaEurope\\n\\nthe Caribbean\\nNorthern America\\nOceaniaSource:\\n \\nNote:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany African countries have experienced signi˚cant changes in the size of their populations in recent years, \\nas shown in ˚gure 2, which ranks the top 20 African countries with the largest proportional population change \\nbetween 2009 and 2019. All top 20 countries were in sub-Saharan Africa and each underwent substantial \\npopulation growth during this period. These 20 countries re˜ect the trend across the continent, with Africa \\ncurrently the fastest-growing region in the world and expected to surpass 2\\n billion people by 2050.\\n5 It is \\nimportant to note that the largest proportional population changes from 2009 to 2019 occurred in countries \\nwith relatively smaller populations, as to be expected. Africa™s most populous countries Œ Nigeria, Ethiopia \\n\\n\\n56and Egypt Œ are not among the top 20; however, all three countries also experienced increases in their \\npopulations.\\n6 The population growth in Africa is in contrast to population change in Europe, for example, \\nwhich has experienced slower population increases in some countries and even decline in others over the \\nsame period (see ˚gure 14).\\nThe signi˚cant increase in international migration \\nwithin Africa (see ˚gure 1) has contributed to the recent \\npopulation growth at the national level. While migration is not the only factor, with high fertility rates \\nand increasing life expectancy also playing roles,\\n7 increased intraregional migration within the continent \\nhas in˜uenced population changes in some countries. For example, the share of international migrants as \\na proportion of national population in Equatorial Guinea has sharply increased in recent years. In 2005, \\ninternational migrants accounted for less than 1\\n per cent of Equatorial Guinea™s population; by 2019, this \\n˚gure had increased to nearly 17\\n per cent. South Africa is another example. In 2005, international migrants \\ncomprised 2.8 per cent of South Africa™s population; by 2019, this ˚gure had risen to 7\\n per cent. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%LiberiaSomaliaMalawi\\nBeninSenegal\\nMozambique\\nMauritania\\nBurkina Faso\\nUnited Republic of Tanzania\\nMaliGambiaZambia\\nBurundiChadGabon\\nUganda\\nAngola\\nNiger\\nEquatorial Guinea\\nSource:\\n \\nNote:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n57The African countries with the largest numbers of emigrants tend to be in the north of the region. These \\nare shown on the left-hand side of ˚gure 3, where countries are ranked by their overall numbers of migrants \\n(the combination of immigrants in the country and emigrants from the country). In 2019, Egypt had the \\nlargest number of people living abroad, followed by Morocco, South Sudan, Somalia, Sudan and Algeria. In \\nterms of the number of immigrants, South Africa remains the most signi˚cant destination country in Africa, \\nwith around 4 million international migrants residing in the country. Other countries with high immigrant \\npopulations as a proportion of their total populations but not among the top 20, included Gabon (19%), \\nEquatorial Guinea (18%), Seychelles (13%) and Libya (12%).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMigrants(millions)Percentage of\\n202442010010RwandaAngolaZimbabweMozambiqueGhanaKenya\\nMaliSomaliaEthiopiaAlgeriaBurkina FasoUganda\\nof the Congo\\nNigeria\\nMoroccoSudanSouth SudanCôte d\\'IvoireEgyptSouth Africa\\nImmigrantEmigrantSource:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n58Signi˚cant migration corridors within and from Africa exist, many of which are related to geographic proximity \\nand historical ties, as well as displacement factors. The size of a migration corridor from country A to country \\nB is measured as the number of immigrants from country A who were residing in country B in 2019. Migration \\ncorridors represent an accumulation of migratory movements over time and provide a snapshot of how migration \\npatterns have evolved into signi˚cant foreign-born populations in speci˚c destination countries. Some of \\nthe largest migration corridors involving African countries, as shown in ˚gure 4, are between North African \\ncountries such as Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to France, Spain and Italy, in part re˜ecting post-colonial \\nconnections and proximity. Others, such as those between South Sudan and Uganda as well as Somalia and \\nEthiopia are the result of large-scale displacement due to con˜ict. Signi˚cant labour migration corridors to \\nGulf States also exist, as in the case of Egypt to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Importantly, just \\nover half of the main migration corridors shown in ˚gure 4 were within Africa, with the corridor from Burkina \\nFaso to neighbouring Côte d™Ivoire constituting the second largest for Africa overall. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0.0 0.51.0 1.5Migrants (millions)\\nMigrants placeof residenceAfricaAsiaEuropeZimbabwe -South AfricaEgypt -Kuwait\\nTunisia -FranceMorocco -ItalySomalia -Kenya\\nSudan -Saudi ArabiaSouth Sudan -Ethiopia\\nSomalia -Ethiopia\\nMali -Côte d\\'IvoireCôte d\\'Ivoire -Burkina FasoSudan -South SudanMorocco -SpainMozambique -South AfricaSouth Sudan -SudanEgypt -United Arab Emirates\\nEgypt -Saudi ArabiaMorocco -FranceSouth Sudan -UgandaBurkina Faso -Côte d\\'IvoireAlgeria -FranceSource:\\n \\nNote:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n59Displacement within and from Africa is a major feature of the region, as shown in ˚gure 5. Most refugees \\nand asylum seekers on the continent were hosted in neighbouring countries within the region. The top \\n10 countries in Africa, ranked by the combined total of refugees and asylum seekers both hosted by and \\noriginating from a given country, are shown in ˚gure 5. Similar to 2017, South Sudan produced the highest \\nnumber of refugees in Africa in 2018 (2.3 million), and ranked third in the world, with most hosted in \\nneighbouring countries such as Uganda. After decades of con˜ict, Somalia produced the second highest \\nnumber of refugees in the region and the ˚fth highest in the world, with the majority hosted in Kenya and \\nEthiopia. Other large refugee populations have originated from Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \\nthe Central African Republic and Eritrea. Uganda remained the largest host country of refugees in the region, \\nwith around 1.2 million refugees living in the country; most were from South Sudan and the Democratic \\nRepublic of the Congo. Other large refugee hosting countries in 2018 were Sudan and Ethiopia. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKenyaBurundiEritreaCentral AfricanRepublicSomaliaEthiopiaUgandaRepublic of the CongoSudanSouth Sudan2101Persons (millions)HostedAbroadAsylum seekersRefugeesSource:\\n Note:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n60The largest new internal displacements in Africa in 2018 took place in sub-Saharan Africa, with the majority \\ndisplaced by con˜ict, not disasters. This is in contrast to Asia, which experienced a larger number of \\ndisplacements caused by disasters (see ˚gure 12). Con˜ict displacement within countries was most pronounced \\nin Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which dwarfed the remainder of the region (˚gure\\n 6). \\nAt the end of 2018, there were 2.9 million new con˜ict displacements in Ethiopia, the largest number \\nglobally, and much higher than the 2017 ˚gure, which was just over 700,000. In addition to those displaced \\nby con˜ict, there were more than 290,000 new displacements in Ethiopia as a result of disasters. In 2018, \\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo had the second highest number of new con˜ict displacements both in \\nAfrica and globally, with the ˚gure reaching 1.8 million. In the Central African Republic, while the scale of \\ndisplacement was not as acute as in countries such as Ethiopia, it had the highest proportional rate of internal \\ndisplacement (11%). Notably, several countries with large numbers of internal displacements Œ such as the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Somalia Œ are also either hosting or producing signi˚cant \\nnumbers of refugees and asylum seekers (see ˚gure 5). It is also important to mention that countries such as \\nMozambique, which recently experienced large-scale displacement due to cyclones Idai and Kenneth, are not \\nincluded in ˚gure 6. This is because the data used only capture the number of new internal displacements \\nduring 2018, not 2019.

The number of \\ninternational migrants in South Africa increased from around 2\\n million in 2010 to over 4 million in 2019\\n.21  Meanwhile, Eastern Africa continues to experience considerable levels of outward labour mobility, driven by \\npoverty, low wages and high unemployment.\\n22 This is most evident in the large number of low- and semi-\\nskilled East Africans who have in recent years moved to GCC States on temporary work contracts. The Gulf \\nStates™ proximity to Eastern Africa and their employment opportunities make them an attractive destination \\nfor many East Africans.\\n23 In Eastern and Southern Africa, intraregional migration is also driven by the growing demand for high- \\nand low-skilled labour. \\nAs East African economies, such as Kenya and Rwanda, are becoming increasingly \\ndiversi˚ed, demand for workers in the services industry, for example, has drawn migrant workers from other \\nEast African countries, including Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. This is especially the case for \\nRwanda™s expanding technology sector, which continues to attract workers from within the subregion.\\n24 The \\nEast African Common Market Protocol, which provides for the free movement of labour, has helped to facilitate \\nlabour migration within the subregion.\\n25 Several countries have rati˚ed the Protocol and some have already \\nabolished work permits for East African citizens, making it easier for people to work across the subregion. \\nMeanwhile, intraregional labour migration is well established in Southern Africa, where signi˚cant numbers \\nof people have traditionally migrated from countries such as Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi and Zimbabwe, to \\nwork in South Africa and Botswana.\\n26 While traditional sectors, such as mining, continue to attract migrant \\nworkers, other sectors Œ including ˚nance and information technology Œ are increasingly drawing migrants \\nto South Africa.\\n27 Migration in Eastern and Southern Africa continues to involve high numbers of irregular migrants, \\ncharacterized by mixed migration ˜ows and underpinned by multiple drivers, including socioeconomic \\nfactors, con˜ict and political instability.\\n Migrant smuggling is particularly prominent in both subregions, \\nwith many people using the services of smugglers to reach their intended destinations. Many smuggling \\nnetworks are based in the Horn of Africa, while countries that are members of the East African Community Œ \\nsuch as Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania Œ are largely transit countries.\\n28 The Middle East, Europe \\nand Southern Africa are among the major destinations for migrants from Eastern Africa, who use several \\nroutes, including the Eastern routes to the Arab Peninsula and other countries in the Middle East, southern \\nroutes to Southern Africa, and northern routes to North Africa, Europe and North America. However, the Horn \\nof Africa routes are also signi˚cant, with a large number of people moving to or within the Horn of Africa.\\n29 Similar to Eastern Africa, irregular migration is widespread in Southern Africa, and involves intraregional \\n20\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\n22\\n23\\n\\n24\\n25\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n63migrants, such as those from Zimbabwe and Mozambique, moving to South Africa, as well as those from \\noutside the subregion.\\n30 Migrant smuggling networks have proliferated over the decades and have become \\nmore organized and professionalized, as it has become increasingly dif˚cult to cross borders in Southern \\nAfrica.31 While a signi˚cant number of migrants smuggled into Southern Africa are from within the subregion, \\na large number also originate from outside Southern Africa, most notably from the Horn of Africa. Many \\nmigrants often face signi˚cant vulnerability, with many experiencing violence and extortion.\\n32 Environmental change and disasters in Eastern and Southern Africa are prevalent and increasing, and \\nare in˜uencing human movement and displacement. \\nThe subregion has faced increased variability in \\nprecipitation and higher occurrence of drought in recent decades.\\n33 These slow-onset environmental changes \\nhave a major impact on food security, given that agriculture is a dominant economic sector in both Eastern \\nand Southern Africa.\\n34 Droughts have become a regular occurrence in countries such as Somalia, and are a \\nmajor driver of displacement in the country. In 2018, there were a quarter of a million new displacements in \\nSomalia due to drought.\\n35 In 2017, drought-related displacements reached more than 850,000 in Somalia.\\n36 Drought conditions have been responsible for increased malnutrition, food scarcity and increased competition \\nfor already limited resources, especially among farmers and pastoralists in the subregion; an estimated 1.2 \\nmillion children in Somalia were acutely malnourished in 2017.\\n37 Several countries in Southern Africa also \\nexperienced signi˚cant displacement due to sudden-onset hazards. From January to June 2018, Eastern \\nAfrica accounted for ˚ve of the most severe disaster events in the world.\\n38 And in March 2019, Southern Africa \\nexperienced two subsequent cyclones, Idai and Kenneth, which brought torrential rains and winds, leaving \\na trail of destruction in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. Cyclone Idai, which made landfall in central \\nMozambique, is considered one of the worst natural disasters to hit Southern Africa in decades.\\n39 By April, \\nthe cyclone had claimed almost 600 lives and displaced more than 130,000 people in Mozambique alone.\\n40 Xenophobic attacks on migrants and the emergence of new armed groups in Southern Africa have \\ncontributed to increased displacement in the subregion\\n. Over the last 10 years, migrants in countries such \\nas South Africa have increasingly been subjected to violence, resulting in the destruction of property, injuries \\nand sometimes loss of life. Nationwide xenophobic attacks, such as those that took place in 2008, displaced \\nthousands of migrants and resulted in more than 60 deaths.\\n41 More recently, xenophobic attacks in 2018 \\nled to several deaths, looting and destruction of property belonging to foreign nationals; the violence has \\nextended into 2019 with more lives lost\\n.42 Outbreaks of xenophobic violence are most common in South Africa™s \\ntownships and other economically poor neighbourhoods, where residents often blame foreign nationals for \\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n\\n\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\n\\n35\\n36\\n\\n\\n\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n\\n64high rates of crime and job losses. In parts of the subregion, armed groups terrorizing communities continue \\nto cause displacement. In northern Mozambique, for example, an armed group known as \\nAl-Sunna wa Jama™a\\n remains a potent threat and has driven hundreds of people from their homes.\\n43West and Central Africa\\nIntraregional migration, which is signi˚cant in West and Central Africa, is characterized by migration \\n˜ows that are in˜uenced by multiple drivers. \\nWhile there are signi˚cant data de˚cits on movement, and \\naccurate numbers can be dif˚cult to ascertain, recent estimates indicate that the majority of international \\nmigrants in West and Central Africa move within the subregion.\\n44 Intraregional migration dominates for several \\nreasons, including visa-free movement among the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) \\nmembers, the relatively small sizes of many countries in the subregion and the strong networks among the \\nmany ethnic groups scattered across the subregion.\\n45 Importantly, intraregional migration within ECOWAS is \\nmostly due to labour mobility, with seasonal, temporary and permanent migrant workers moving largely from \\ncountries such as the Niger and Mali toward Ghana and Côte d™Ivoire.\\n46 A large number of migrant workers \\nare in low-skilled sectors, including domestic work, informal trade and agriculture.\\n47 In parts of West Africa, \\nagricultural labourers often move during the harvest period (July to September), as well as through the off-\\nseason harvest that runs until March.\\n48 Some of the migrant workers are children, as is the case with the \\nmovements between Côte d™Ivoire and Burkina Faso.\\n49 Unlike West Africa, where environmental and economic \\nfactors are important drivers of intraregional migration, con˜ict and instability have played a larger role in \\ndisplacement to neighbouring countries in Central Africa.\\n50 However, labour migration is not absent in Central \\nAfrica, with Gabon, for example, home to a large number of migrant workers from within Central Africa who \\nwork in its oil and lumber industries.\\n51Irregular migration remains prevalent in West and Central Africa, although free movement agreements \\nin the subregion have been designed to facilitate migration and reduce irregularity. \\nThe use of \\nsmugglers to cross borders even within free movement areas such as ECOWAS is not uncommon, particularly \\nin circumstances where people do not possess identity documents.\\n52 It is important to emphasize, however, \\nthat most West Africans who are smuggled overland begin their journeys as regular migrants under the free \\nmovement protocol and only violate immigration laws after exiting the ECOWAS area.\\n53 Moreover, a number \\nof borders in West Africa are extremely porous, enabling unauthorized movements between countries, with \\nseveral ECOWAS borders cutting across politically unstable and sparsely populated areas, which are also \\ncharacterized by security de˚ciencies.\\n54 For many West and Central African migrants attempting to cross the \\nMediterranean to reach Europe, the Niger is an important country of transit as well as a major smuggling \\n43\\n\\n\\n44\\n45\\n46\\n\\n\\n49\\n50\\n51\\n52\\n53\\n54\\n65hub.\\n55 The Niger™s weak border management capacity has been exacerbated by an increase in attacks by armed \\nand extremist groups operating along the country™s borders. Most attacks, including from Boko Haram, have \\nbeen concentrated in the Niger™s Diffa region, located in the south-east of the country, bordering Nigeria. The \\nviolence has had a devastating impact on health services and education, and has driven thousands of people \\nfrom their homes.\\n56 Con˜ict and violence linked to political upheavals, communal and ethnic tensions and Boko Haram \\nextremism, have meant that most countries in West and Central Africa are affected by internal or cross-\\nborder displacement, although the magnitude varies dramatically\\n. As with other subregions in Africa, \\ncountries in West and Central Africa have long histories of hosting and producing displaced populations, often \\nsimultaneously. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is one such example. At the end of 2018, it was home \\nto more than half a million refugees, while at the same time it was the country of origin of over 700,000 \\nrefugees, with 300,000 of them residing in Uganda and signi˚cant numbers in other neighbouring countries, \\nincluding Rwanda (77,000) and Burundi (71,000).\\n57 The protracted nature of con˜ict in the Democratic \\nRepublic of the Congo, which involves dozens of armed groups, has had a devastating effect on the country, \\ncreating one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. At the end of 2018, there were 3\\n million IDPs in \\nthe country, the third highest number of people displaced as a result of violence and con˜ict globally (see \\nchapter 2, ˚gure 11).\\n58 Meanwhile, with large swathes of the country controlled by armed groups, the civil war \\nin the Central African Republic was reignited in 2016 after a period of relative calm; the con˜ict spilled over \\ninto 2017 and 2018, wreaking havoc and sending hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. Both the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic ranked among the top 10 origin countries \\nof refugees in the world in 2018, with the Central African Republic producing nearly 600,000 refugees and \\nmore than half a million con˜ict IDPs.\\n59 The Boko Haram insurgency, which began in 2009 in Nigeria™s \\nnorthern State of Borno, combined with counter-insurgency operations and communal clashes over scarce \\nresources, have also led to signi˚cant displacement in the Lake Chad region. With more than 2.2 million IDPs, \\nNigeria ranked among the top 10 countries with the highest number of people displaced due to con˜ict and \\nviolence by end of 2018 (see chapter 2, ˚gure 11).\\n60 In the same year, there were more than 600,000 IDPs in \\nCameroon and over 156,000 in the Niger.\\n61 Some of the violence and displacement in West Africa is linked to \\ncon˜ict between pastoralists and farmers over land and resources, although these con˜icts often have ethnic \\nand religious dimensions too.\\n62Environmental changes in West and Central Africa are impacting human livelihoods and mobility.\\n For \\nexample, although precipitation events in the Sahel\\n63 are slowly increasing, they are becoming increasingly \\nunpredictable, leading to the frequent occurrence of droughts and ˜oods.\\n64 In the Niger, an estimated 40,000 \\ndisaster-related displacements were recorded at the end of 2018, while in Nigeria, there were around 600,000 \\n55\\n56\\n\\n\\n59\\n\\n60\\n61\\n62\\n\\n63\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n64\\n\\n66displacements as a result of ˜oods in the same year.\\n65 At the same time, rapid population growth has led to \\nthe intensi˚cation of cropping, deforestation and overgrazing, contributing to land degradation.\\n66 Despite \\nan increase in the scale of agriculture in the subregion, food insecurity remains rampant.\\n67 For example, \\nat the end of 2018, more than 3\\n million people were affected by food insecurity in the Lake Chad Basin.\\n68 Millions of people in West and Central Africa depend on Lake Chad; however, the lake™s volume has decreased \\nby 90\\n per cent in area in the last 40 years, due to increased drought and human-related causes such as \\nincreased irrigation withdrawals.\\n69 The lake™s shrinkage has not only affected the livelihoods of millions \\nof people, but also impacted cattle transhumance, and is increasingly a source of tension and communal \\ncon˜ict;70 moreover, the deterioration of living conditions, which has made it dif˚cult for people living along \\nthe lake to adapt to the harsher conditions, has created an ideal environment for armed groups to emerge.\\n71 The complex and interconnected environmental changes Œ such as droughts and ˜oods, overexploitation of \\nresources and climate change Œ are contributing factors to ruralŒurban and cyclical mobility within countries \\nand across borders in the subregion. Migration is one strategy used to increase livelihoods and reduce risks \\nin the Western Sahel, particularly in light of uncertain agricultural returns.\\n72 Research has also highlighted \\nthe interconnections between, on the one hand, impacts of climate change on natural-resource-dependent \\nlivelihoods and food insecurity and, on the other hand, tensions, con˜icts and mobility.\\n73North AfricaMigration of North Africans to Europe and Gulf States continues to be a de˚ning feature of the \\nmigration dynamics of the subregion, and one that has developed over several decades. \\nMigration of \\nNorth Africans to countries outside of Africa has been, and continues to be, much higher than migration to \\nother countries within the subregion and within Africa.\\n74 Two distinct streams have characterized out˜ows \\nfrom North Africa: migrants from the north-west (such as Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia) have historically \\nmoved to Europe, owing to their geographic proximity, previous labour recruitment agreements and post-\\ncolonial ties,\\n75 while those from the north-east (such as Egypt and Sudan) have predominantly sought \\ntemporary work in GCC countries. Large income disparities between the origin and destination countries, and \\nthe high levels of unemployment in North Africa, remain signi˚cant drivers of migration. As of 2019, almost \\n12 million North Africans were living outside their countries of birth, with roughly half in Europe and 3.3 \\nmillion living in Gulf States.\\n76 In addition to being a major migrant transit area, North Africa also hosts notable populations of \\ninternational migrants, including refugees.\\n Sudan had the largest number of international migrants in \\n65\\n66\\n\\n\\n\\n69\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n67the subregion, over 1.2 million in 2019.\\n77 Sudan was followed by Libya, with over 800,000. The number of \\ninternational migrants in Egypt increased from 300,000 in 2010 to more than 500,000 in 2019, with migrants \\nprimarily originating from the Syrian Arab Republic, Somalia, Sudan and the Palestinian Territories.\\n78 While \\nMorocco has traditionally been a country of emigration, it is increasingly becoming a destination country, \\nincluding of migrants from other subregions in Africa, who stay for an indeterminate period while looking for \\na way to cross over to Europe.\\n79 Con˜ict and violence within North Africa, and in surrounding subregions, have contributed to \\ndisplacement. At the end of 2018, Sudan was the sixth largest country of origin of refugees globally, with \\naround 700,000 refugees, the majority of whom were hosted by the neighbouring countries of Chad, South \\nSudan and Ethiopia.\\n80 Sudan also had approximately 2.1 million IDPs due to con˜ict and violence.\\n81 At the \\nsame time, Sudan is also a prominent host country of refugees, with over 1 million refugees (this number more \\nthan doubling since 2016), most of whom were from South Sudan, Eritrea and the Syrian Arab Republic.\\n82 Algeria also hosted over 94,000 refugees by the end of 2018,\\n83 while Egypt hosted over 240,000 refugees, \\nprimarily originating from the Syrian Arab Republic, the Palestinian Territories and other African countries \\nand territories.\\n84 A volatile security and political situation in Libya had contributed to a total population \\nof 221,000 IDPs by the end of 2018 (a drop from over 300,000 in 2016), while also affecting the more than \\n56,000 refugees and asylum seekers residing in Libya.\\n85 As a key hub of transit activity for migrants originating from many countries to the south, the North \\nAfrican subregion is confronted with protection challenges associated with irregular migration to \\nEurope.\\n In 2018, approximately 117,000 migrants arrived in Europe by sea.\\n86 This is a signi˚cant drop \\ncompared with 2017 (around 172,000) and 2016, when the number rose to 364,000.\\n87 There has also been a \\nshift in the routes taken by most irregular maritime migrants; while the majority from Africa who entered \\nEurope in 2016 and 2017 used the Central Mediterranean route (from Libya, mainly to Italy), most irregular \\nmaritime arrivals to Europe in 2018 took the Western Mediterranean route (from Morocco, mainly to Spain).\\n88 There were close to 59,000 sea arrivals in Spain, as opposed to around 23,000 in Italy.\\n89 The change in \\nmajor routes, from the Central to the Western Mediterranean, is linked to several factors, including closer \\ncooperation between the European Union (EU) and countries of origin and transit, counter smuggling efforts, \\nas well as increased maritime security patrols off the Libyan coast.\\n90 Migrants from sub-Saharan African \\ncountries comprised the majority of irregular maritime arrivals in Spain, followed by Moroccans.\\n91 People \\nwho travelled the Central Mediterranean route to Italy were mostly Tunisian, followed by Eritreans, Iraqis, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n90\\n\\n\\n91\\n68Sudanese and Pakistanis.\\n92 From January to November 2018, an estimated 15\\n per cent of all irregular maritime \\narrivals in Italy were unaccompanied children.\\n93 There are sizeable migrant smuggling routes to, within and from North Africa, with smuggling \\nincreasingly concentrated among a few organized criminal networks\\n.94 With the help of smugglers, \\nmigrants from countries in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, often embark on highly dangerous journeys \\nto North Africa, including through the Sahara Desert.\\n95 One of the main smuggling passageways includes \\nmigrants moving from Somalia, Sudan and Ethiopia, towards Egypt and Israel.\\n96 But as socioeconomic \\nconditions in Egypt have deteriorated in recent years, smugglers have turned increasingly to countries such \\nas Libya, which prior to 2011 was a signi˚cant destination for migrant workers and, more recently, has \\nbecome a major smuggling hub and the main departure point for migrants trying to get to Europe via the \\nCentral Mediterranean route.\\n97 The subregion continues to struggle with serious human rights violations and \\nprotection challenges; many migrants in transit are exposed to sexual and gender-based violence, forced \\nlabour, arbitrary detention, extortion and exploitation, among other abuses. This is especially the case in \\nLibya, where human smuggling often morphs into traf˚cking. In 2018, IOM assisted over 16,000 migrants \\nto return home after they had been detained or stranded in Libya,\\n98 some at the hands of smugglers and \\ntraf˚ckers. The protracted civil con˜ict in Libya has created a climate of lawlessness, in addition to severely \\nweakening its institutions and crippling its economy.\\n99 Asia100Asia Œ home to around 4.6 billion people Œ was the origin of over 40\\n per cent of the world™s international \\nmigrants in 2019 (111 million). More than half (66 million) were residing in other countries in Asia, a \\nsigni˚cant increase from 2015, when around 61 million were estimated to be living within the continent. As \\nshown in the middle panel of ˚gure 7, intraregional migration within Asia has increased signi˚cantly over \\ntime, rising from 35 million in 1990. Considerable growth has also occurred in Asian-born migrant populations \\nin Northern America and Europe over the last two decades. In 2019, migration from Asia to Northern America \\nreached 17 million, rising from a little over 16 million in 2015, whereas in Europe, migration from Asia stood \\nat nearly 22 million in 2019. Migration from Asia to Northern America and Europe drove much of the increase \\nin the number of Asian migrants outside the region, reaching a total of 44.6 million extra-regional migrants \\nin 2019, an 11 per cent increase from 40 million in 2015. \\nThe number of non-Asian-born migrants in Asia has remained at relatively low levels since 1990. Europeans \\ncomprise the largest group of migrants from outside Asia in the region. These numbers include migrants from \\nthe European part of the former Soviet Union now living in Central Asia. During the same period, the number \\nof Africans Œ the other sizable group of migrants in Asia Œ has grown. \\n92\\n93\\n94\\n95\\n96\\n\\n\\n99\\n\\n100\\n\\n\\n\\n69\\n\\n\\n\\nMigrants to AsiaMigrants within AsiaMigrants from Asia199019952000200520102015 2019199019952000200520102015 2019199019952000200520102015 20190204060YearMigrant Stock (millions)RegionAfrica\\nAsiaEurope\\n\\nthe Caribbean\\nNorthern America\\nOceaniaSource:\\n \\nNote:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSeveral Asian countries have undergone substantial changes in the size of their populations in recent years. \\nThese changes are shown in ˚gure 8, which ranks the top 20 Asian countries with the largest proportional \\npopulation change from 2009 to 2019. Except the Syrian Arab Republic, all top 20 countries experienced \\nincreases in their populations during this period. GCC countries, which are all represented among the top 20 \\ncountries, underwent some of the most signi˚cant population changes over the last decade. International \\n70migration has been a signi˚cant determinant of population change in Asia, and especially in GCC States, \\nwhich continue to be important destinations for migrant workers from within Asia and from outside the \\nregion. As illustrated in ˚gure 9, international migrants make up large proportions of national populations \\nin GCC States, with migrants in the United Arab Emirates, for example, accounting for 88\\n per cent of the \\ncountry™s population.\\n101 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-40%-20%0%20%40%60%80%Israel\\nTurkmenistan\\nSyrian Arab Republic\\nKyrgyzstan\\nTimor-Leste\\nMongolia\\nPakistan\\nUnited Arab Emirates\\nTajikistan\\nSaudi Arabia\\nYemen\\nAfghanistan\\nIraq\\nBahrain\\nLebanonJordan\\nKuwait\\nMaldives\\nQatar\\nOmanSource:\\n \\nNote:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two Asian ﬁpopulation giantsﬂ, India and China, have the largest absolute numbers of migrants living \\nabroad (˚gure\\n 9). It is important to add that these large absolute numbers of emigrants constitute small \\nshares of the total populations of India and China. Migrants from China made up the third largest population \\nof foreign-born migrants in the world after India and Mexico. Nearly 3 million Chinese-born emigrants resided \\nin the United States, which was also home to other large Asian migrant groups from India, the Philippines \\nand Viet Nam. Other countries with large numbers of migrants residing abroad include Bangladesh and the \\nSyrian Arab Republic.\\nIn GCC countries, migrants make up high proportions of the total national populations (˚gure 9). For example, \\nin 2019, migrants accounted for 88\\n per cent of the population in United Arab Emirates; 72\\n per cent in Kuwait; \\n101\\n\\n\\n71nearly 79\\n per cent in Qatar; and 45\\n per cent in Bahrain.\\n102 Many migrants came from Africa, South Asia \\n(for example, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal), and South-East Asia (for example, Indonesia and the \\nPhilippines). \\nIt is also important to note that current data on foreign-born migrants also partly re˜ect signi˚cant historical \\nevents, such as the 1947 Partition, resulting in the mass displacement of people from and to India and \\nPakistan.

The \\nSyrian Arab Republic and Afghanistan were the top origin countries of refugees in the world. The impact of \\nthe Syrian con˜ict on displacement can be clearly seen in ˚gure 11, with refugees and asylum seekers from \\nthe Syrian Arab Republic dwar˚ng numbers from Afghanistan. In 2018, the vast majority of refugees from \\nAsian countries lived in neighbouring countries. Refugees from the Syrian Arab Republic, for example, were \\npredominantly hosted in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, while refugees from Afghanistan, whose size grew \\nfrom 2.6 million in 2017 to 2.7 million in 2018 (mostly due to births during the year), were largely hosted in \\nPakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Due to violence against and persecution of the Rohingya, Myanmar \\nproduced the third largest refugee population in the region and the fourth largest in the world in 2018, with \\nmost refugees hosted in Bangladesh. As shown in ˚gure 11, it is also important to note that origin countries \\nsuch as Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Iraq are also themselves hosting refugees. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSyrian Arab RepublicTurkeyAfghanistanPakistanIran (Islamic Republic of)MyanmarBangladeshLebanonIraqJordan5 2.5 0 2.5\\nPersons (millions)HostedAbroadAsylum seekersRefugeesSource:\\n Note:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n74The largest new internal displacements in Asia resulted from disasters (˚gure 12). The Philippines, which had \\n3.8 million new disaster displacements at end of 2018, recorded the largest number globally. The disasters \\nthat triggered displacement included volcanic eruptions, and ˜ooding caused by monsoons and landslides. \\nWith around 3.7 million displacements, China recorded nearly as many new disaster displacements as the \\nPhilippines. China was followed by India (2.7 million) and Indonesia (853,000). Con˜ict also contributed to \\na large number of new internal displacements in Asia, with the Syrian Arab Republic recording the largest \\nnumber (1.6 million), around 9\\n per cent of its population. Other countries where con˜ict led to signi˚cant \\ninternal displacement included Afghanistan (372,000), Yemen (252,000) and the Philippines (188,000). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMillions\\nPhilippinesChinaIndiaSyrian Arab Republic\\nIndonesiaAfghanistan\\nMyanmar\\nYemen\\nIraq\\nJapanViet Nam\\nSri Lanka\\nBangladeshIran (Islamic Republic of)\\n\\nRepublic of Korea\\nMalaysia\\nCambodia\\nNepalDisaster3 2 1 0 1\\n2 0 2 4 6 8\\nSource:\\n \\n\\nNotes:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n75Key features and developments in AsiaSouth-East AsiaFor many countries in South-East Asia, migration entails signi˚cant levels of both emigration and \\nimmigration, as well as transit migration.\\n Considerable income disparity in the subregion is a major factor \\nunderpinning the strong trend of people to migrate from lower-income countries to higher-income countries \\nwithin (and beyond) the subregion. There are a little more than 10 million international migrants within \\nthe subregion and just over 21.8 million total migrants from the subregion, 6.8 million of whom migrated \\nto other countries within South-East Asia.\\n103 The advanced economies of Malaysia and Singapore are notable \\ndestinations for migrants. The efforts of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) toward greater \\nregional integration have contributed to increased intraregional migration. There is also a strong geographic \\naspect to migration, with higher levels of migration occurring between countries sharing borders, particularly \\nalong Thailand™s border with neighbours Cambodia, the Lao People™s Democratic Republic and Myanmar.\\n104 Intraregional, long-term migration corridors are evident, which are mainly dominated by temporary labour \\nmigration, with smaller components of permanent (skilled and family) migration, student migration and \\nforced migration.\\n105Labour migration, a prominent feature in South-East Asia and a key driver of economic growth and \\ndevelopment, is also associated with inconsistent human rights practices. \\nLabour migrants have long \\nbeen integral to the economies of major destination countries within the subregion Œ such as Malaysia, \\nSingapore and Thailand Œ where they help ˚ll gaps in labour markets. This is especially the case for lower-\\nskilled sectors such as ˚sheries, domestic work and construction.\\n106 Meanwhile, the prospects for employment \\nand higher wages often compel people from countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia to move to more \\nprosperous economies within the subregion.\\n107 Many migrants send signi˚cant shares of their earnings to their \\nfamilies back home, with the Philippines, for example, consistently ranking among the largest remittance-\\nrecipient countries in the world. In 2018, the Philippines, whose international remittance in˜ows amounted \\nto USD 34 billion, was the fourth largest remittance recipient globally after India, China and Mexico.\\n108 But \\neven as labour migration has helped relieve labour shortages in destination countries, many labour migrants \\ncontinue to face exploitative conditions. Workers employed in low-skilled, labour-intensive sectors, regardless \\nof their legal status, are most affected, with wage-related abuse the most common.\\n109 Many labour migrants \\nare required to work extremely long hours for below minimum wages, a consequence of inadequate protection \\nafforded to labour migrants during both recruitment and employment.\\n110 103\\n\\n\\n104\\n\\n105\\n106\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n109\\n\\n\\n110\\n76Migration involves high proportions of irregular migration, mostly in relation to economic factors \\nsuch as poverty and lack of employment.\\n Irregular migration ˜ows such as those from Cambodia and the \\nLao People™s Democratic Republic to destinations including Thailand and Malaysia are often facilitated by \\nsmugglers. Smugglers also play a signi˚cant role in irregular migration out of the subregion, with Vietnamese \\nmigrants moving to Europe, for example, often using smugglers to reach their destinations.\\n111 Mixed migration \\n˜ows exist (involving movements of people with and without international protection needs), as do migration \\n˜ows underpinned by mixed motivations. Many migrants face exploitation in South-East Asia, stemming \\nfrom their irregular status. Migrant workers in particular industries also face forced labour, exploitation \\nand serious abuse (for example, in the ˚shing, agriculture, construction and manufacturing industries).\\n112 In addition to smuggling, traf˚cking of persons continues to be a challenge in South-East Asia, with nearly \\nhalf of all victims in Asia (46%) traf˚cked within the subregion.\\n113 Large numbers of people are traf˚cked for \\nboth sexual exploitation and forced labour, with a larger share of females traf˚cked for sexual exploitation in \\n2016.114 Countries such as Malaysia and Thailand had more victims of forced labour than sexual exploitation \\nin 2016.115There has been an increase in displacement in the subregion due to violence, systemic persecution and \\nmarginalization.\\n The Rohingya refugee situation is the most acute, and remains one of the most complex \\nrefugee crises in the world. By end of 2018, there were over 900,000 Rohingya in Cox™s Bazar, Bangladesh, \\nand more than 1\\n million people in need of humanitarian assistance.\\n116 The Kutupalong-Balukhali site in Cox™s \\nBazar continues to be the biggest and most densely populated refugee settlement in the world; refugees \\nfrom Myanmar accounted for the fourth largest refugee population in the world in 2018.\\n117 Due to a surge in \\ntargeted killings and human rights abuses in August 2017, a signi˚cant number of Rohingya were displaced \\nfrom Myanmar™s Rakhine State, the majority seeking protection in Bangladesh. While this was not the ˚rst \\ntime that Rohingya ˜ed Myanmar as a result of violence, the August 2017 violence prompted one of the \\nlargest waves of displacement in decades. Meanwhile, within South-East Asia, Malaysia continued a long-term \\ntrend of hosting a large population of refugees and people in refugee-like situations (over 120,000 in 2018), \\nmainly as a result of displacement caused by civil con˜ict in Myanmar over many years.\\n118 Resettlement of \\nrefugees from the subregion is mainly undertaken by ﬁtraditionalﬂ resettlement countries (such as the United \\nStates, Canada and Australia), and there is little by way of ﬁprotection infrastructureﬂ within the subregion.\\n119 There are also large populations of IDPs and stateless populations in the subregion, with eight countries in \\nthe subregion hosting stateless populations (the largest of which is in Myanmar, which hosted more than \\n600,000 at end of 2018).\\n120 111\\n112\\n113\\n114\\n115\\n116\\n\\n\\n119\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n120\\n\\n77Southern Asia\\nMigration from Southern Asia to other subregions is a key feature, with many temporary migrant \\nworkers in the GCC countries originating from this subregion.\\n The prospects of higher wages and \\naccessible employment opportunities have resulted in a signi˚cant increase in the number of people leaving \\nthe subregion in recent years.\\n121 For countries in the subregion with signi˚cant labour surpluses, migration \\nhas relieved labour pressures, while helping to reduce poverty through remittances. Accordingly, Southern \\nAsia is among the largest recipients of remittances in the world. In 2018, remittance in˜ows to India amounted \\nto USD 79 billion, the largest in the world; and in countries such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, \\nremittances exceeded 5\\n per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the same year.\\n122Migration within the subregion is a dominant feature in Southern Asia, driven by economic and labour \\nmarket differentials.\\n123 Intraregional movement, both regular and irregular, is related to strong common \\nhistorical roots, geographic proximity, and cultural and kinship ties between countries.\\n124 In 2019, just under \\n80 per cent of the 14\\n million international migrants in Southern Asia originated from other countries in the \\nsubregion.\\n125 Major migration corridors include BangladeshŒIndia, AfghanistanŒPakistan, IndiaŒPakistan and \\nNepalŒIndia; however, it is important to note that these corridors are all quite distinct, re˜ecting a range \\nof historical and contemporary economic, security and cultural factors. There are millions of Bangladeshi \\nand Nepalese labour migrants currently working in India, for example, primarily in the informal sector as \\nconstruction labourers and domestic workers, whereas the IndiaŒPakistan corridor in part re˜ects the mass \\ndisplacement following the 1947 Partition of India and Pakistan.\\n126 Further, many of the 3.9 million Afghan \\ninternational migrants who reside in the subregion (primarily in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan) \\nhave been displaced across borders due to con˜ict and violence within Afghanistan that has waxed and waned \\nsince the 1970s.\\n127 Internal migration within the countries of South Asia is extensive and larger in scale than \\ninternational migration, related primarily to temporary and seasonal migration from rural to urban areas.\\n128 From 2001 to 2011, Southern Asia™s urban population grew by 130 million people.\\n129 However, while ruralŒ\\nurban migration has contributed to this growth, it has largely been driven by the reclassi˚cation of rural \\nsettlement and natural population increase.\\n130 121\\n\\n122\\n123\\n\\n124\\n125\\n\\n\\n126\\n\\n\\n\\n129\\n\\n130\\n78Irregular migration both within and from the subregion is common in Southern Asia, and is often aided \\nby loose smuggling networks. \\nWhile the exact number of people undertaking irregular migration within the \\nsubregion is not known, there are estimated to be large irregular migrant populations within the subregion.\\n131 India, for example, is home to signi˚cant populations of irregular migrants from Bangladesh, Nepal and, to \\na lesser extent, Sri Lanka.\\n132 Regions including Europe, Northern America and Oceania are among the most \\npreferred destinations of irregular migrants from Southern Asia.\\n133 Socioeconomic and insecurity factors in \\ncountries of origin, in addition to better wages and employment opportunities in destination countries, are \\namong the factors associated with irregular migration and migrant smuggling.\\n134 Migrants from Southern \\nAsia heading to Western Europe are primarily smuggled through Central Asia and the Russian Federation, as \\nwell as through the Middle East into the Western Balkans.\\n135 Other irregular migrants are smuggled through \\nto Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia for work.\\n136 There have been many documented cases of migrants being \\nexploited and abused by smugglers in Southern Asia.\\n137 Traf˚cking of persons remains a serious concern \\nin Southern Asia, although data and information for many countries in the subregion are scarce. A 2018 \\nUNODC report estimates that nearly 60\\n per cent of victims of traf˚cking detected in the subregion in 2016 \\nwere female, based on information available for four countries, including Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal and \\nPakistan.\\n138 In Nepal, there were more child victims than adult victims.\\n139 Long-standing con˜ict, political instability, violence and repression have made Southern Asia a \\nsigni˚cant source of displacement; the subregion also hosts signi˚cant populations of displaced \\npersons. \\nIn recent history, every country in the subregion (other than Maldives) has been an origin or a \\nhost of displaced populations. Most notably, at the end of 2018, there were 2.7 million Afghan refugees, the \\nsecond largest refugee population in the world after the Syrian Arab Republic, and 2.6 million Afghan IDPs.\\n140 The neighbouring countries of Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran hosted the most Afghan refugees \\nand, accordingly, featured among the top host countries in the world.\\n141 Pakistan, with its porous border and \\nclose ethnic, linguistic, religious and economic ties, has been the major host for decades, with around 1.4 \\nmillion refugees at the end of 2018, almost exclusively Afghans;\\n142 around 60,000 refugees were repatriated to \\nAfghanistan in 2017, most of them from Pakistan.\\n143 At the end of 2018, the Islamic Republic of Iran hosted \\nclose to 1 million refugees,\\n144 making it the sixth largest refugee host country in the world, while both India \\nand Bangladesh continued to host large IDP populations.\\n145 131\\n\\n132\\n\\n133\\n\\n134\\n135\\n\\n136\\n\\n\\n\\n139\\n140\\n\\n141\\n142\\n143\\n144\\n145\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n79Southern Asian populations are particularly vulnerable to slow-onset and rapid-onset disasters related \\nto natural hazards and climate change. \\nExcept for Afghanistan, where con˜ict and violence played a larger \\nrole in driving people from their homes, disasters were responsible for most displacements in Southern Asia \\nin 2018.146 There were an estimated 3.3 million new displacements in Southern Asia due to sudden-onset \\nhazards in 2018, with most of those affected in India, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Relative to \\nits population size, Southern Asia has the highest number of people at risk of displacement as a result of \\nsudden-onset hazards, with Bangladesh, India and Pakistan having the highest disaster risk.\\n147 India bore \\nmost of the brunt of the disasters in the subregion, with more than 2.7 million displacements as a result of \\ntropical storms and ˜oods.\\n148 Afghanistan had the second highest number of disaster displacements in the \\nsubregion, with 371,000 new displacements, mostly due to drought conditions. Thousands of people were also \\ndisplaced in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as a result of monsoons.\\n149 The scale of disaster-related destruction \\nand displacement in Southern Asia in recent years has in part been attributed to poor planning and lack \\nof preparedness in the subregion.\\n150 Migration and mobility are particularly important coping strategies in \\nresponse to environmental change events in Southern Asia Œ including sea-level rise, coastal erosion, ˜ooding \\nand groundwater depletion Œ all of which pose considerable challenges in the subregion.\\n151 Eastern Asia\\nEastern Asia is undergoing signi˚cant demographic change, with several countries experiencing low \\nfertility rates and ageing populations, leading to revisions of immigration policies. \\nCountries such as \\nJapan are already experiencing negative population growth, while the Republic of Korea™s fertility rate is well \\nbelow the replacement rate of 2.1 required to sustain a population.\\n152 In 2019, Japan had the lowest potential \\nsupport ratio in the world (the number of workers per retiree) and, along with China, was among the top \\n10 most populous countries with fertility rates that are below replacement.\\n153 These demographic changes \\nhave far-reaching implications for public debt, the welfare state and labour markets. Japan, for example, is \\ngrappling with an acute labour shortage.\\n154 These realities are prompting policymakers to reassess historically \\nrestrictive approaches toward immigration, which have been associated with a relatively high degree of \\ncultural homogeneity in some countries, more limited experience in immigration policy compared with other \\nregions and subregions, and the relative unpopularity of immigration in many countries.\\n155 146\\n\\n\\n149\\n150\\n151\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n152\\n\\n\\n153\\n154\\n155\\n\\n\\n80As key Eastern Asian countries experience declines in their populations, several countries have passed \\nnew immigration laws or implemented programmes meant to attract foreign workers.\\n In December \\n2018, Japan™s Parliament approved a new immigration law easing restrictions on foreign workers in industries \\nfacing labour shortages, with the changes expected to bring in more than 300,000 workers.\\n156 Recent changes \\nto Japan™s immigration laws are also partly a response to the surge in demand for workers in areas such \\nas construction, as the country prepares to host the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\\n157 Meanwhile, through the \\nEmployment Permit System, which allows in˜ows of foreign workers from partner Asian countries\\n158 that have \\nsigned memorandums of understanding, the Republic of Korea is expected to accept 56,000 foreign workers \\nin 2019, in an effort to address labour shortages.\\n159 China, primarily a country of origin of migrant workers, \\nhas also recently sought to attract workers in high-skilled and low-skilled sectors, both through changing its \\nimmigration policies and signing bilateral agreements. Attracting an increasing number of foreign workers \\nis not only designed to address skills gaps, but is also part of the country™s efforts towards more economic \\nopenness and inclusiveness. In 2018, for example, China relaxed its visa requirements for professionals \\nand high-skilled workers, in a bid to attract top foreign talent\\n160 to join an economy that is gradually \\ntransitioning from manufacturing to services. In the same year, the country established, for the ˚rst time, the \\nState Immigration Administration. The new immigration bureau is a response to both a growing number of \\ninternational migrants in China and the need to streamline and better manage immigration.\\n161 Additionally, \\nChina and the Philippines signed an agreement in 2018 that will allow 300,000 Filipino workers, including \\n100,000 English language teachers, to work in China.\\n162 Migration in Eastern Asia is increasingly characterized by signi˚cant outward and inward student \\nmobility.\\n The number of international students from Eastern Asia, particularly at the tertiary level, has \\nincreased rapidly in recent years, while the number of foreign students within the subregion also continues \\nto grow. Driven by the prospect of better-quality education, a high number of international students from \\nEastern Asia study in destinations such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. China continued \\nto a major source of international students globally in 2018, with over half a million of its students embarking \\non further studies abroad, an increase of more than 8\\n per cent from 2017.\\n163 However, Eastern Asia is not only \\na major origin of international students, it is also gradually becoming an important destination for foreign \\nstudents, many of them coming from within the subregion. The number of international students at higher \\neducation institutions in China was over 490,000 in 2018.\\n164 Students from the Republic of Korea accounted \\nfor the largest number of international students in China in 2018.\\n165 They were followed by students from \\nThailand, Pakistan and India.\\n166 156\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n159\\n160\\n161\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n162\\n163\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n164\\n\\n\\n\\n165\\n166\\n81Outward labour migration, particularly from China, has meant that the subregion is one of the largest \\nrecipients of international remittances in the world.\\n In 2019, Chinese-born international migrants were \\nthe third largest foreign-born population in the world after Indians and Mexicans, with nearly 11 million \\nChinese migrants living outside of China.\\n167 Global remittance ˜ows in 2018 amounted to nearly USD 690 \\nbillion, with China receiving over USD 67 billion, the second largest share of international remittances \\nworldwide after India.\\n168 While this chapter is focused primarily on international migration, it is important to note that, in \\nthis context, internal migration has been a signi˚cant feature in Eastern Asian countries, involving \\nunprecedented movement of people from rural areas to urban centres. \\nWhile the pace of urbanization has \\nslowed and even decreased in parts of the continent such as Western Asia, Eastern Asia has undergone one of \\nthe fastest rates of urbanization over the last few decades.\\n169 By 2015, the share of urban population in the \\nsubregion had risen to 60\\n per cent, more than tripling since 1950.\\n170 This has most notably been the case in \\nChina, where the economic and social reforms of the 1980s initiated one of the largest human migrations in \\nhistory. Among the reforms was the relaxation of the Hukou system, devised to record and control internal \\nmigration, which tied people™s access to services to their residential status. As a result, hundreds of millions \\nof workers, driven by the prospect of employment and higher wages, left the countryside for the cities, where \\nmost economic activities were concentrated and in demand of both unskilled and skilled labour migrants.\\n171 Most people have migrated from China™s western provinces to its eastern provinces. The socioeconomic \\ndynamics between western and eastern China are important factors, with the west characterized by high \\npopulation growth rates, a surplus of workers and lower incomes, while the east contends with a shortage of \\nworkers in metropolitan areas and records both higher incomes and higher education levels.\\n172 A recent new (atypical) feature in Eastern Asia™s migration dynamics was the arrival of hundreds of \\nasylum seekers from countries ravaged by con˜ict and violence.\\n In 2018, over 500 Yemeni asylum seekers \\narrived on the Republic of Korea™s Jeju Island, gaining entry through the Island™s visa-free policy designed to \\nattract tourists.\\n173 The arrival of Yemenis generated intense public debate and some anti-immigrant sentiment, \\nin a country where asylum applications have historically been low. The Republic of Korea has not previously \\nbeen much of a destination country for those seeking protection (except those from the Democratic People™s \\nRepublic of Korea).\\n174 By the end of 2017, China and the Republic of Korea had around 600 and nearly 20,000 \\nasylum seekers, respectively.\\n175 \\n\\n\\n\\n169\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n82Central AsiaMigratory movements in Central Asia occur in large part out of the subregion, and most noticeably \\nnorthward to the Russian Federation. \\nIn 2019, for example, there were just under 5 million migrants born \\nin Central Asia who were living in the Russian Federation.\\n176 With signi˚cantly higher wages and better \\nemployment opportunities,\\n177 the Russian Federation has long been a leading destination for labour migrants \\nfrom Central Asia.\\n178 For people in rural Kyrgyzstan, for example, labour migration has become a livelihood \\nstrategy, with many Kyrgyz migrant workers seeking employment in the Russian Federation, with provinces \\nsuch as Siberia becoming increasingly popular.\\n179 The Russian Federation is also attractive because of the \\nlarge number of Kyrgyz who are already well-established in the country and provide assistance in terms \\nof ˚nding suitable accommodation and work for new arrivals.\\n180 But not all migrants from Central Asia to \\nthe Russian Federation are low-skilled labour migrants; migrants from Kazakhstan, for example, are largely \\ncomposed of students and highly skilled professionals.\\n181 People from Central Asia also migrate to other parts \\nof Europe and China, where work and family ties are relatively strong. An increasing number of Central Asians \\nare also moving to destinations such as Turkey and the Republic of Korea to ˚nd work; movements to the \\nRepublic of Korea have been facilitated by bilateral labour agreements with countries such as Uzbekistan and \\nKyrgyzstan.\\n182 Intraregional migration is a key feature in the subregion and is underpinned by geographic, cultural, \\neconomic, political and social links that are historical in nature\\n. Central Asia is home to millions of \\ninternational migrants, mainly from within the subregion, but also from further a˚eld. Migrants primarily \\noriginate from countries of the former Soviet Union, many of which are current members of the Commonwealth \\nof Independent States.\\n183 In 2019, Kazakhstan, for example, had a substantial foreign-born population \\n(3.7 million), of whom 2.4 million were born in the Russian Federation.\\n184 Kazakhstan is now predominantly \\na country of transit and of immigration, attracting skilled workers from various countries and, increasingly, \\nbecoming a destination for low-skilled migrant workers from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In \\nrecent years, Central Asian countries have revised policies regulating intraregional migration, including \\nthrough the conclusion of bilateral agreements on entry and readmission.\\n185 For example, the establishment \\nof the Eurasian Economic Union in 2015 has allowed people from its member States Œ including Kazakhstan \\nand Kyrgyzstan Œ to move freely to live, work and study in other member States of the Union.\\n186 Further \\ncooperation is currently occurring in the region on enhancing the management of mixed ˜ows, including on \\naspects related to border management, migrants™ rights and protection, and irregular migration.\\n187 There is a \\ngrowing recognition of the importance of undertaking proactive migration policies and programmes in order \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n83to protect the rights and dignity of migrants, as well as their families and communities.\\n Both male and female \\nmigrant workers from Central Asia can be vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, particularly within informal \\nemployment, such as construction, agricultural and domestic work.\\n188 International remittances play an important role in Central Asian economies, especially for the less \\ndeveloped countries in the subregion. \\nTwo of the world™s top 10 remittance-receiving countries relative \\nto GDP are in the subregion Œ Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.\\n189 In Kyrgyzstan, remittances have been estimated \\nto reduce the national poverty rate by 6Œ7\\n per cent.\\n190 Remittance ˜ows into Central Asian countries largely \\nre˜ect migration patterns within and from the subregion, which are closely linked to work and income \\ngeneration. Remittances from the Russian Federation, for example, have been substantial over time, aided \\nby the relatively low transfer costs from the Russian Federation to the Central Asian countries. After a few \\nyears of consecutive decline, driven by economic slowdown and policy changes in the Russian Federation, \\nremittances to Europe and Central Asia bounced back in 2017, growing by 21\\n per cent and reaching USD 48 \\nbillion in 2017.\\n191 This ˚gure further increased to USD 59 billion in 2018.\\n192 Among the factors behind this \\ngrowth was the continued recovery of economic activity in the Russian Federation.\\n193 Irregular migration is a feature in Central Asia, although exact numbers are dif˚cult to ascertain.\\n Irregular migrants come from both within and outside the subregion, with those transiting through Central \\nAsia often moving toward Western Europe. Most migrants™ ˚rst points of entry are Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan \\nbefore being smuggled through Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation to Western Europe.\\n194 Factors such \\nas weak border management, combined with isolated borders, have contributed to irregular migration across \\nthe subregion.\\n195 Migrant smuggling in Central Asia is a complex process, and involves both formal and \\ninformal arrangements at various border points within the subregion, as well as transborder activities that \\nhelp facilitate the movement of people beyond Central Asia.\\n196 Middle EastGulf countries have some of the largest numbers of temporary labour migrants in the world. \\nDriven \\nby oil wealth, GCC countries have undergone remarkable economic development over the last few decades, \\ndrawing both skilled and semi-skilled workers to various sectors, including construction and maintenance, \\nretail and domestic service. In countries such as Qatar, the recent increased demand for workers in areas \\nsuch as construction is partly driven by the country™s preparation for the 2022 World Cup.\\n197 The increase \\nin labour migration to GCC States has created tremendous demographic change. In 2019, migrants made \\nup the majority of the population in half of the GCC countries Œ comprising 88\\n per cent of the population \\n\\n\\n190\\n191\\n192\\n193\\n194\\n\\n195\\n196\\n\\n\\n84in the United Arab Emirates, around 79\\n per cent in Qatar and 72\\n per cent in Kuwait.\\n198 Labour migrants in \\nGCC countries primarily originate from Asia and Africa. Income differentials between origin and destination \\ncountries are a key driver of migration, with the Gulf countries providing higher wages and employment \\nopportunities to labour migrants.\\n199 Despite some progress, regulation and protection of migrants™ rights \\nremain a challenge in the subregion. The \\nKafala\\n sponsorship system,\\n200 which ties migrant workers to their \\nemployers and is practised across a number of GCC States, has come under scrutiny. Although several Gulf \\nStates have implemented reforms to the \\nKafala\\n system, the changes have been minimal and have had little \\npositive effect on migrants.\\n201 The sponsorship system remains widespread and continues to contribute to the \\nvulnerability of labour migrants in the Gulf, including to conditions of forced labour and wage exploitation.\\n202Civil con˜ict, intensi˚cation of sectarian violence and the proliferation of terrorism (particularly by \\nDaesh) have resulted in extensive levels of internal and international displacement in the subregion \\nin recent years.\\n Two countries in the subregion Œ the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen Œ are facing ﬁlevel 3ﬂ \\nemergencies (the global humanitarian system™s classi˚cation for the most severe, large-scale humanitarian \\ncrises) and are key contributors to the world™s total displacement ˚gures.\\n203 The con˜ict in the Syrian Arab \\nRepublic, occurring now for over seven years, has displaced well over half of the country™s population, with \\nover 6.6 million refugees and over 6.1 million IDPs, and had produced close to 140,000 asylum seekers \\nby the end of 2018.\\n204 Successive waves of displacement in Iraq Œ a feature since the beginning of the \\ncentury\\n Œ continued and intensi˚ed in 2016 and into 2017. This occurred in the context of efforts to retake \\nterritory and counter Daesh. While over 1.9 million Iraqis remained internally displaced by end of 2018, this \\nwas the ˚rst time in nearly over four years that this number fell to under 2\\n million.205 A growing number of \\nIraqis have also returned home, as Daesh has increasingly been pushed back and lost territory in both Iraq and \\nin the Syrian Arab Republic; the militant group has lost more than 90\\n per cent of the territory it controlled in \\nboth countries.\\n206 Yemen™s political and security situation continued to deteriorate, and the ensuing violence \\nand volatility left the country with over 2.3 million IDPs at the end of 2018.\\n207 By the end of 2018, more than \\n8 per cent of Yemen™s population had been internally displaced. \\nThe Middle East continues to host a signi˚cant share of the world™s refugees. \\nAt the end of 2018, the \\nMiddle East subregion hosted the largest number of refugees globally, including the refugees registered with \\nthe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA).\\n208 Neighbouring \\ncountries inevitably share a disproportionate burden when it comes to hosting people seeking refuge in \\nother countries, and this dynamic is a key feature of contemporary displacement patterns in the subregion. \\nAs countries bordering the Syrian Arab Republic and the principal hosts of Syrian refugees, Turkey, Lebanon \\n\\n\\n\\n199\\n\\n200\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n201\\n\\n202\\n203\\n204\\n\\n205\\n\\n206\\n\\n\\n85and Jordan were all among the top 10 host countries in the world in 2018 (Turkey is 1st, Lebanon 7th and \\nJordan 10th).\\n209 The depth of their responsibility is particularly apparent when the number of refugees in \\neach country is compared against the national population Œ in Lebanon, there were 156 refugees per 1,000 \\ninhabitants; in Jordan, 72 per 1,000; and in Turkey, 45 per 1,000.\\n210 Other countries in the subregion, \\nincluding those affected by con˜ict, also host many refugees, including Yemen and Iraq, and even the Syrian \\nArab Republic.\\n211 The almost 5.5 million refugees registered with UNWRA are also located in the subregion.\\n212 Irregular migration within and from the subregion continues to pose challenges for migrants and \\nStates. \\nPolitical instability and protracted con˜icts in the Middle East are major drivers of irregular migration \\nand migrant smuggling in the subregion.\\n213 Most smuggled migrants in the subregion are people escaping \\ncon˜ict and violence. Migrant smuggling and irregular migration often go hand in hand with refugee and \\nasylum movements.\\n214 As con˜icts have proliferated across the subregion, so has the number of smuggled \\nmigrants and countries affected by smuggling networks. Moreover, smuggling networks have become a lot \\nmore diversi˚ed and complex.\\n215 The very large numbers of Syrian refugees hosted in neighbouring countries, \\ntogether with the protracted con˜ict and the low probability of return to the Syrian Arab Republic, have seen \\nrefugees undertaking irregular migration onward to other countries, most notably those in Europe via the \\nEastern Mediterranean route. \\nEurope216Over 82 million international migrants lived in Europe in 2019, an increase of nearly 10\\n per cent since 2015, \\nwhen 75 million international migrants resided in the region. A little over half of these (42 million) were \\nborn in Europe but were living elsewhere in the region; while this number has only moderately increased \\nsince 2015, it was much lower in 1990, at around 28 million (˚gure 13). From 2015 to 2019, the population \\nof non-European migrants in Europe increased from a little over 35 million to around 38 million.\\nIn 1990, there were roughly equal amounts of Europeans living outside Europe as non-Europeans living in \\nEurope. However, unlike the growth in migration to Europe, the number of Europeans living outside Europe \\nmostly declined during the last 30 years, and only returned to 1990 levels over recent years. In 2019, \\nEuropean-born migrants living outside the continent were based primarily in Northern America (7.4 million). \\nThere was also some gradual growth of European migrants in Asia and Oceania from 2010 to 2019. \\n209\\n210\\n211\\n212\\n213\\n214\\n215\\n216\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n86\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nMigrants to Europe\\nMigrants within Europe\\nMigrants from Europe\\n199019952000200520102015 2019199019952000200520102015 2019199019952000200520102015 2019020304010YearMigrant Stock (millions)RegionAfrica\\nAsiaEurope\\n\\nthe Caribbean\\nNorthern America\\nOceaniaSource:\\n \\nNote:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSeveral European countries have experienced large changes in the size of their populations over the last \\ndecade.

Lithuania, Bosnia and \\nHerzegovina and Latvia experienced the steepest population declines (more than 10%). Low fertility rates are \\nthe most important driver of negative population change in parts of Europe. However, negative net migration, \\n87where the number of emigrants exceeds the number of immigrants, has also contributed to population decline \\non the continent, especially in countries such as Lithuania and Latvia.

Portugal and Bulgaria, two countries that have long histories of emigration, also had high \\nshares of populations abroad.\\nWith over 13 million migrants in 2019, Germany had the largest foreign-born population of any country in \\nEurope; the number of immigrants in the country increased by nearly 3 million between 2015 and 2019. The \\nlargest groups came from Poland, Turkey, the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan and the Syrian Arab Republic. \\nThe populations of the United Kingdom and France each included over 9.5 million and around 8 million \\nforeign-born people, respectively, in 2019. Migrants born in French-speaking North African countries made up \\n88some of the largest foreign-born populations in France. In the United Kingdom, some of the largest migrant \\npopulations were from India, Poland and Pakistan. With foreign-born populations of around 6 million, Italy \\nand Spain were the ˚fth and sixth most popular migrant destinations in Europe in 2019; both countries \\nexperienced slight increases in the number of foreign-born migrants since 2015. Many of the foreign-born \\npopulations in these countries came from elsewhere in Europe Œ such as Romania, Albania and the Germany\\n Œ \\nor from North African countries such as Morocco. The migration of people from countries of the former \\nSoviet Union Œ such as Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan Œ accounted for some of the largest European \\nmigrant corridors (see ˚gure 16).

The \\nRussian Federation features heavily in the main corridors. Russian-born populations in former member States \\nof the Soviet Union Œ such as Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan Œ formed some of the largest European \\nmigrant corridors in 2019. However, it is important to note that these Russian-born populations only became \\ninternational migrants after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991; before that, they were internal \\nmigrants within the Soviet Union.

Recent years have, for example, seen a sharp \\nincrease in the number of medical professionals moving to Western Europe. Attracted by higher wages, \\na signi˚cant number of medical professionals from countries such as Romania, Poland and Slovakia have \\nleft their countries to work in Western Europe.\\n219 It is estimated that, by 2015, Romania had lost half its \\ndoctors.\\n220 The emigration of high-skilled professionals, in addition to a declining population, has created a \\nsevere shortage of workers in some sectors in several countries in Eastern Europe.\\nDespite the anticipated demographic decline across Europe, with Eastern Europe experiencing some \\nof the most dramatic population changes, some countries are resistant to immigration as part of a \\nbroader response. \\nAs fertility rates in Europe fall, the number of elderly continues to rise. More people are \\nliving longer and life expectancy in Europe and Northern America reached 78.7 years in 2019 and is projected \\nto increase to 83.2 years by 2050\\n.221 Globally, an estimated 962 million people were over the age of 60 in 2017, \\nwith Europe having the largest percentage (25%).\\n222 As the number of elderly expands, the social protection \\nsystems in Eastern European countries will come under signi˚cant strain, with public spending on health \\ncare and pensions expected to signi˚cantly increase.\\n223 Meanwhile, a decline in the number of people of \\nworking age will have key implications for Europe™s labour force, with the average age of people participating \\nin the labour force reaching 42.6 years by 2030.\\n224 Even as Eastern Europe™s population grows older, many \\ncountries in the subregion are reluctant to embrace immigration as one part of the longer-term solution to \\nimpending demographic crises. Countries such as Hungary are already beginning to feel the negative effects \\nof a declining labour force. In response to a shortage of workers and the impact this is having on the country™s \\neconomy, in 2018 the Government of Hungary passed a controversial law that generated mass protest action; \\nthe so-called ﬁslave lawﬂ could require people to work up to 400 hours of mandatory overtime.\\n225 In February \\n2019, Hungary also announced new loan and tax bene˚ts aimed at boosting the country™s low birth rate, while \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n219\\n220\\n221\\n\\n\\n222\\n223\\n224\\n225\\n\\n\\n93it remains openly opposed to immigration.\\n226 However, while attitudes and political discourse on immigration \\nremain negative across Eastern Europe, countries such as Poland have increasingly been tapping into foreign \\nlabour, particularly Ukrainians, to address labour shortages. The number of Ukrainians in Poland has sharply \\nincreased since ˚ghting began in Eastern Ukraine in 2014. In 2017, Poland issued more than 660,000 residence \\npermits to foreigners, with the majority (more than 85%) going to Ukrainians.\\n227 The Russian Federation remains the major destination country in the subregion (and one of the \\nmost signi˚cant in the world).\\n In 2019, the country hosted around 11.6 million international migrants.\\n228 Most immigrants have come from neighbouring countries, most notably members of the Commonwealth of \\nIndependent States.\\n229 Immigrants from Ukraine comprised the largest number of foreign born populations \\nin the Russian Federation (over 3 million), followed by Kazakhstan (around 2.5 million) and Uzbekistan \\n(1.1 million).230 The Russian Federation™s large number of international migrants, many of whom are labour \\nmigrants, means that the country is also one of the biggest origins of remittances in the world. In 2018, \\nremittances from the Russian Federation amounted to USD 21 billion, owing to the slow and but steady \\nrebound of the country™s economy, which continues to attract labour migrants.\\n231 In 2019, Ukraine also had \\na signi˚cant foreign-born population at around 5 million, with migrants originating in large part from the \\nBelarus, Kazakhstan, the Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation and Uzbekistan.\\n232 The subregion has experienced increased displacement in recent years, largely as a result of the \\nprotracted con˜ict in Eastern Ukraine.\\n The con˜ict, now in its ˚fth year, has resulted in signi˚cant \\ninternal displacement and generated an out˜ow of refugees and migrants to neighbouring States. By the \\nend of 2018, Ukraine was the origin of nearly 93,000 refugees and around 800,000 IDPs.\\n233 In 2018 alone, \\nthere were 12,000 new con˜ict/violence displacements in Ukraine (see ˚gure 18).\\n234 A signi˚cant number of \\nrefugees from Ukraine were living in the Russian Federation. Since the start of the con˜ict in Eastern Ukraine \\nin 2014, an estimated 400,000 people moved to the Russian Federation, with a large number having gained \\nrefugee status or temporary asylum.\\n235 226\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n229\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n230\\n\\n\\n231\\n\\n\\n232\\n\\n\\n233\\n\\n234\\n235\\n94Northern, Western and Southern Europe\\nIntraregional migration within Europe is particularly dynamic, continuing to increase over time. \\nAs \\nof 1 January 2017, there were 22 million persons living in one of the EU member States with the citizenship \\nof another member State, up from 16 million a year prior.\\n236 Such a high degree of intraregional migration is \\nmade possible by free movement arrangements, which enable citizens to cross borders without being subjected \\nto border checks. The Schengen Area, which comprises 22 EU member States and 4 non-EU member countries, \\nguarantees free internal movement to over 400 million citizens.\\n237 In 2017 Romania, Poland, Italy, Portugal \\nand Bulgaria had the highest numbers of their citizens living in other EU member States.\\n238 However, free \\nmovement in Europe faces challenges. In 2015, the arrival of large numbers of migrants and refugees to Europe \\nvia the Mediterranean put pressure on the common European asylum system and affected the functioning of \\nthe Schengen rules. This led to a temporary suspension of the Dublin system and the introduction of border \\nchecks by several member States.\\n239 There is also a degree of uncertainty, particularly for migrant workers, \\nfollowing the June 2016 EU membership referendum in the United Kingdom about future migration settings \\narising from ﬁBrexitﬂ negotiations. However, the bigger issue is the ˚nalization of Brexit itself, and whether/\\nhow it will be implemented. \\nImmigration continues to be a contentious issue in Europe and remains on top of the political agenda \\nacross the region.\\n While balanced debates on the issue are not absent, political rhetoric and public discourse \\non migration have at times been dominated by anti-immigrant sentiments. Over the course of 2017 and \\n2018, far-right wing groups across Europe promoted myths or ﬁfake newsﬂ about migration.\\n240 This was most \\nevident in the coordinated online campaigns against the Global Compact for Migration by far-right activists, \\nincluding through social media, online petitions and videos. The negative campaigns played a signi˚cant role \\nin generating backlash against the Global Compact for Migration in several European countries, prompting \\nsome governments to withdraw from the migration pact.\\n241 General attitudes toward immigration also remain \\npolarized, while negative anti-immigration political rhetoric continues to take centre stage in several \\nnational elections across Europe.\\n242 A 2018 European Commission survey found that four in ten Europeans \\nview immigration as more of a problem than an opportunity.\\n243 In a separate survey conducted in 10 EU \\ncountries\\n244 by the Pew Research Centre, more than half said they want fewer immigrants in their countries.\\n245 Irregular migration continues to pose challenges to the region, and remained high on the European \\nagenda in 2017 and 2018. By the end of 2018, the largest number of irregular maritime arrivals to Europe \\nused the Western Mediterranean route, which leads to Spain.\\n246 This marked a change from 2016 and 2017, \\nwhen irregular maritime migrants arrived to Europe in the greatest numbers via the Central Mediterranean \\nroute from Libya (mainly to Italy) or from Turkey to Greece on the Eastern Mediterranean route. In 2018, over \\n236\\n\\n\\n\\n239\\n240\\n\\n241\\n242\\n\\n243\\n\\n244\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n245\\n\\n246\\n\\n95117,000 and more than 26,000 migrants arrived in Europe by sea and land, respectively.\\n247 There were around \\n59,000 sea arrivals in Spain and 23,370 in Italy in the same year.\\n248 More than 2,000 migrants died in the \\nMediterranean in 2018, with the Central Mediterranean route by far the deadliest route for irregular migrants \\nin 2018 (over 1,300 deaths).\\n249 While the number of migrants who died at sea trying to reach Europe dropped \\nin 2018 due to fewer overall crossings, the death ratio along the Central Mediterranean route increased \\nfrom 2.6% in 2017 to 3.5% in 2018 and, by April 2019, it had reached 10\\n per cent.\\n250 A large number of \\nmaritime arrivals in 2018 came from countries that continue to be affected by violence and con˜ict, including \\nAfghanistan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq, especially to Greece. North and sub-Saharan Africans also \\ncontinued to make up a signi˚cant portion of migrant ˜ows to Europe, especially to Italy and Spain. \\nHuman traf˚cking remains a major challenge in Europe, and the region has seen a rise in both \\ntraf˚cking for labour and sexual exploitation.\\n Traf˚cking in human beings for sexual exploitation remains \\nthe predominant form of human traf˚cking in Europe (56%), followed by labour exploitation (26%) and other \\nforms of exploitation, such as forced begging or organ removal (18%).\\n251 Women and girls continue to be the \\nmost vulnerable group (68% of victims), often exploited in care and domestic work and forced prostitution.\\n252 Two important trends reported by EU member States are the sharp increase in child traf˚cking (23% of all \\nvictims) and the growth of intra-EU traf˚cking (44% of victims are EU citizens).\\n253 Pro˚les of traf˚ckers and \\nmodus operandi have changed, with an observed increase in the number of women and younger perpetrators, \\nand a growing role of Internet and social media for recruitment and distribution of exploitation material. \\nDespite growing awareness and knowledge of traf˚cking practices, prosecution and conviction rates remain \\nlow. Irregular migrants are especially vulnerable, as traf˚ckers often take advantage of their status to lock \\nthem into cycles of exploitation. In 2018, a case of migrant ˚shermen working on Irish registered trawlers was \\nbrought to the Republic of Ireland™s High Court; some of the migrants were believed to have been traf˚cked \\nand worked under harsh conditions, including being racially abused, underpaid and overworked.\\n254Latin America and the Caribbean255Migration to Northern America is a key feature in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. In 2019, \\nover 26\\n million migrants had made the journey north and were residing in Northern America. As shown \\nin ˚gure 19, the Latin American and the Caribbean population living in Northern America has increased \\nconsiderably over time, from an estimated 10 million in 1990 and 25.5 million in 2015 to 26.6 million \\nin 2019. Another 5 million were in Europe in 2019; while this number has only slightly increased since \\n2015, the number of migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean living in Europe has more than \\nquadrupled since 1990. Other regions, such as Asia and Oceania, were home to a very small number of \\nmigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean in 2019 (400,000 and 200,000 migrants, respectively). \\n\\n\\n249\\n250\\n251\\n\\n252\\n253\\n254\\n\\n255\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n96The total number of migrants from other regions living in Latin America and the Caribbean has remained \\nrelatively stable, at around 3 million over the last 30 years. These were comprised mostly of Europeans \\n(whose numbers have declined slightly over the period) and Northern Americans, whose numbers have \\nincreased.

Around 12 \\nmillion Mexicans lived abroad in 2019. Mexico is also the second largest migrant origin country in the world \\nafter India. Most Mexican emigrants lived in the United States, which continues to be the largest country-to-\\ncountry migration corridor in the entire world (˚gure 22). Many other Central American countries Œ such as \\nEl Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras Œ also have large migrant populations in the United States, as do South \\nAmerican countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil and Peru. Large populations of South American migrants \\nresided elsewhere in the region. Colombia and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela had the second and \\nthird highest number of emigrants in the region in 2019 (2.9 million and 2.5 million respectively). Around \\n1 million Venezuelans lived in Colombia, re˜ecting recent cross-border displacement from the Bolivarian \\nRepublic of Venezuela. \\n98In 2019, Argentina was home to the largest foreign-born population in the region (with over 2 million \\nmigrants), mainly from neighbouring countries such as Paraguay and the Plurinational State of Bolivia. The \\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela had the next largest migrant population, followed Colombia and Mexico. In \\n2019, Mexico had over 760,000 migrants born in the United States. As illustrated in ˚gure 21, of the top 20 \\nmigrant countries in the region, Costa Rica had the highest immigrant share of its total population (8%), due \\nto long-standing migration from neighbouring Nicaragua. Other countries in the region outside of the top 20 \\nhad higher migrant populations as a proportion of the total population, such as Belize at 15\\n per cent.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMigrants(millions)Percentage of\\nImmigrantEmigrantMexico\\nColombiaVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)\\n\\nBrazilPeruDominican Republic\\nCubaEl SalvadorChileEcuadorGuatemalaJamaicaParaguayHondurasNicaragua\\nUruguayCosta Rica12 8 4 0\\n30 20 10 0 10\\nSource:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most striking feature of the main migration corridors within and from the region (˚gure 22 is the \\ndominance of the United States as the main country of destination.

An estimated 3 million Venezuelans had left their \\ncountry at the end of 2018 due to several factors, including violence, persecution and economic/political \\ncrisis. The vast majority of Venezuelans displaced abroad lived in Colombia (around 1 million). Colombia was \\nthe largest country of origin of refugees in the Latin America and Caribbean region. Most of the refugees from \\nColombia were hosted in the neighbouring countries of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Ecuador. El \\nSalvador was the second largest country of origin of refugees and the second largest source of new asylum \\nclaims in the region, after the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.

The poor state of the health-care system and increasing levels of malnutrition \\namong children resulted in multiple deaths in 2018.\\n260 The International Monetary Fund estimated that \\nhyperin˜ation in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela would reach over 1 million\\n per cent in 2018, and \\nwould increase to 10 million\\n per cent in 2019.\\n261 In addition to the economic crisis, the Bolivarian Republic of \\nVenezuela is experiencing a deteriorating political situation, which involves targeting of political opponents \\nand the arrest of thousands of protesters.\\n262 The rise in violent crimes in the country also continues to force \\nmore people to seek protection in other countries. Asylum applications lodged by Venezuelans arriving in the \\nUnited States, for example, reached nearly 28,000 by the end of June 2018.\\n263 Intraregional migration within South America is very signi˚cant, with the large majority of  \\ninternational migrants currently moving within the subregion\\n. Most migrants in countries such as \\nArgentina and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, the two countries with the largest number of international \\nmigrants in South America in 2019, were from within the subregion.\\n264 Argentina™s international migrants \\nwere mainly from Paraguay, the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Chile, while those in the Bolivarian \\nRepublic of Venezuela were largely from Colombia.\\n265 Most of the foreign-born population in Chile is also \\nprimarily comprised of migrants from South American countries such as Peru, Argentina and the Plurinational \\nState of Bolivia.\\n266 The Residence Agreements adopted by the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) Œ an \\neconomic and political body made up of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and the Bolivarian Republic of \\nVenezuela\\n267 Œ have played a signi˚cant role in enhancing intraregional labour migration, while at the same \\n256\\n\\n\\n259\\n260\\n261\\n\\n262\\n\\n\\n263\\n264\\n\\n\\n265\\n266\\n\\n103time reducing irregular migration within the subregion.\\n268 These agreements allow nationals of MERCOSUR to \\nreside and work in member States for a period of two years, provided they have no criminal record and can \\nprove citizenship.\\n269 As a result, low- and semi-skilled migrants in sectors such as agriculture, ˚shing and \\ndomestic work, who comprise the majority of labour migrants in South America,\\n270 have been able to move \\nand work more freely within the subregion.\\nMillions of South Americans continue to reside outside of the subregion, while at the same time the \\nnumber of migrants from outside the subregion is slowly growing. \\nEmigration from South America is \\nmostly related to work, fuelled by economic crises and political instability in origin countries.\\n271 The United \\nStates is the largest destination country of South American migrants, with 3.4 million.\\n272 The countries \\nwith the highest numbers of emigrants residing outside of South America in 2019 were Colombia (around \\n1.57 million), followed by Brazil (1.5 million) and Ecuador (around 1 million).\\n273 At the same time, reduced \\nopportunities in labour markets abroad, as well as improved economic conditions in the subregion, are \\ncontributing to the return of many South American migrants and a decrease in the rate of extraregional \\nmigration.\\n274 The number of migrants in South America from outside the subregion is also growing. For \\nexample, since 2010, more people have emigrated from the EU to Latin America and the Caribbean overall, \\nthan from Latin America and the Caribbean to the EU.\\n275 Many of these people are not return migrants, but \\nrather EU nationals, primarily from Spain, Italy and Portugal.\\n276 Migrants from these three origin countries \\ncollectively represented a population of over 800,000 people in South America in 2019.\\n277 Increased numbers \\nof Haitians, Cubans and Dominicans have also migrated to South America.\\n278 Though localized to particular countries, con˜ict and violence contribute to human displacement \\nand migration in the subregion.\\n In Colombia, over 5.7 million people remained internally displaced as \\nof the end of 2018 Œ the second highest number of IDPs in the world.\\n279 In the same year, around 139,000 \\nColombians were living as refugees or in refugee-like situations abroad, a drop from more than 190,000 in \\n2017 and around 300,000 in 2016.\\n280 There were around 1 million Colombians in the Bolivarian Republic of \\nVenezuela and Ecuador in 2019. However, as Colombia begins to transition out of ˚ve decades of violence with \\npeace talks in late 2016 and 2017, deteriorating economic and social conditions in the Bolivarian Republic of \\nVenezuela are leading many Colombians to return home.\\n281 \\n\\n269\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n104Central America and the CaribbeanMigration northward continues to be the predominant trend in Central America, Mexico and the \\nCaribbean. Mexico remains a prominent origin country, with thousands emigrating mainly to the United \\nStates each year. It is also a signi˚cant transit country for migrants travelling northward to the southern \\nUnited States border. However, within a context of improving economic conditions and rising educational levels \\nin the country, as well as stricter immigration enforcement in the United States, Mexico is an increasingly \\nsigni˚cant destination country for international migrants, some of whom may have been unable to enter \\nthe United States as initially planned.\\n282 The total number of foreign-born persons in Mexico increased \\nfrom around 970,000 in 2010 to a little over 1 million in 2019 Œ a majority of whom were North Americans, \\nbut also an increasingly larger portion of whom were migrants from other Latin American and Caribbean \\ncountries.\\n283 However, the United States is by far the most popular destination for Central American migrants, \\nwith more than 90\\n per cent of Central American migrants living in the United States in 2017.\\n284 Violence and \\ninsecurity, poverty and family reuni˚cation remain important drivers of migration from Central America.\\n285 The most prominent intraregional migrant corridors involve Nicaraguans, Panamanians and other Central \\nAmericans moving to Costa Rica for temporary or permanent labour, and Central Americans (primarily from \\nHonduras, Guatemala and El Salvador) migrating to Belize because of instability and a lack of employment \\nopportunities.\\n286 In the Caribbean, the most prominent intraregional migrant corridors include Haitians \\nmigrating to the Dominican Republic.\\n287 There is also an increasing number of migrants from other regions, \\nincluding those from Africa, transiting through Central America toward the United States.\\n288Irregular migrant ˜ows in the subregion are dynamic, becoming increasingly complex as well as \\ndiverse. \\nMexicans represented the vast majority of irregular migrants apprehended while attempting to \\ncross the United StatesŒMexico border for many years. However, in recent years, apprehensions of Central \\nAmericans originating from the ﬁNorthern Triangleﬂ region of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador exceeded \\nthat of Mexicans at the United StatesŒMexico border.\\n289 Fleeing violence, persecution and poverty, thousands \\nof migrants from Central America trekked for thousands of miles toward the MexicoŒUnited States border. \\nThe most recent so-called ﬁmigrant caravanﬂ began in Honduras in October 2018. As Honduran migrants \\nmade their way toward the United StatesŒMexico border, thousands more migrants from countries such as El \\nSalvador and Guatemala joined the group. By the end of 2018, the migrant caravan had grown to thousands of \\nmigrants, many of them children.\\n290 Several factors drove people to the caravan, including escaping violence in \\ncountries such as Honduras, ˜eeing extreme poverty and seeking better economic opportunities. The migrant \\ncaravan resulted in ˚erce political debate in the United States and prompted the Government to deploy more \\nthan 7,000 active-duty military of˚cers to the border with Mexico.\\n291 By early 2019, a few thousand migrants \\nwho managed to reach the United States border had been apprehended. Some received Mexican humanitarian \\nvisas, while others were deported or chose to return to their countries of origin.\\n292 Hundreds of migrants \\nremain in Tijuana, Mexico. In February 2019, a caravan of Cubans and Haitians, including some Africans \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n290\\n291\\n292\\n\\n105and Asians, entered Panama from Colombia and later reached Mexico. In a shift from its more open policy \\nannounced at the start of 2019, Mexico began detaining migrants from Central America in April 2019.\\n293Migrant smuggling is also a major feature of the subregion, as people attempt to bypass border controls \\nin Central America and Mexico.\\n Along the United StatesŒMexico border, smuggling networks are a pro˚table \\nindustry overseen by international crime groups.\\n294 Smuggled migrants are known frequently to fall victim \\nto predatory practices ranging from demands for bribes to mass kidnapping and extortion.\\n295 Migrants have \\nalso been subjected to execution, physical and sexual assault, torture and disappearance; this is especially \\nthe case in Mexico, where it has been reported that some smuggling networks are often managed by drug \\ntraf˚cking organizations.\\n296 Migrant smuggling has also long enabled irregular migration in and through \\nCentral American countries such as Guatemala, especially with migrants moving to the United States. Both \\nGuatemalan nationals and international migrants transiting through Guatemala have historically heavily \\nrelied on smuggling, locally known as \\nCoyoterismo, to reach their ˚nal destinations.\\n297 There is growing \\nconcern in Latin America that visa regimes are exploited to enable migrants to enter countries in the region \\nbefore they are smuggled onward to other destinations.\\n298 Moreover, a signi˚cant number of people have died \\nwhile making irregular migration journeys across Central America.\\n299 Socioeconomic conditions and generalized community-level violence in a number of Central American \\ncountries contribute to migration, notably of high numbers of women and children. \\nThere has been a \\nsigni˚cant increase in the number of asylum claims from Central America. Applications from Central America \\nand Mexico comprised 54\\n per cent of all asylum claims in the United States in 2017.\\n300 Migrants from El \\nSalvador made up the majority of applicants (over 33,000), followed by those from Guatemala (around 33,000) \\nand the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (27,500).\\n301 There has been an increase in the number of family units \\napprehended at United StatesŒMexico border; in 2018, around 163,000 family members were apprehended, \\naccounting for 35\\n per cent of all border apprehensions and more than three times the number of family \\napprehensions in 2017.\\n302 Unaccompanied children remain a signi˚cant part of irregular migration ˜ows, with \\nabout 54,000 unaccompanied children apprehended at the border in 2018.\\n303Climate change appears to be impacting on human mobility in Central America and the Caribbean, \\nalthough isolating the environmental drivers of migration remains a complex task.\\n According to \\nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the rise in global temperature is associated with \\noutmigration in communities dependent on agriculture.\\n304 In 2018, drought conditions in Central America \\nwere responsible for an estimated 82\\n per cent loss of maize and bean crops in Honduras, putting nearly \\n3 million people at risk of food insecurity.\\n305 In countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, a \\nlarge share of the populations live in rural areas and heavily rely on agriculture for their livelihoods, making \\n293\\n294\\n295\\n296\\n\\n\\n\\n299\\n300\\n301\\n302\\n303\\n304\\n305\\n\\n106them especially vulnerable to environmental changes such as droughts.\\n306 The effects of climate change may \\nhave played a role in recent migration dynamics in Central America, with a signi˚cant number of people who \\nwere part of the caravan, for example, engaged in activities such as agriculture, forestry, cattle raising and \\n˚shing prior to embarking on the journey northward.\\n307 Meanwhile, the Caribbean is located in an area highly \\nprone to both seismic activity and climate-related disaster risks.\\n Countries in the Caribbean are among the \\nmost vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change. With a signi˚cant share of the Caribbean population \\nliving in areas exposed to sea-level rise, recent disasters have resulted in large-scale displacement and loss of \\nlife. Hurricane Irma, for example, which swept across parts of the Caribbean and Northern America, was the \\nlargest disaster event globally in 2017, displacing more than 2 million people in both regions.\\n308 In addition \\nto the loss of life, the hurricane left catastrophic damage to property and infrastructure in several Caribbean \\nareas, including Puerto Rico, Cuba and the United States Virgin Islands.\\n309 Many Caribbean islands are also \\nheavily reliant on sectors such as agriculture and tourism, and disasters have taken a signi˚cant toll on their \\neconomies. As these disasters increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change, health risks and \\nfood insecurity are expected to worsen, in addition to increasing damage to biodiversity.\\n310 Emigration to the United States is a key feature in the Caribbean, with Caribbean-born immigrants \\namong the largest groups in the country.\\n Historical ties between the Caribbean and the United States, as \\nwell as geopolitics, have signi˚cantly in˜uenced migration northward. In 2017, 10\\n per cent of all immigrants \\nin the United States were from the Caribbean, making it the largest destination for Caribbean migrants outside \\nthe subregion.\\n311 Other main destinations include Canada, Spain and the United Kingdom. Over 65\\n per cent of \\nCaribbean immigrants in the United States in 2019 came from just ˚ve countries (Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, \\nCuba, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic), with the majority of these coming from Cuba.\\n312 The increase \\nin the Cuban population in the United States post-mid-1960s was to a large extent driven by two laws that \\noffered unique treatment to immigrants from Cuba: the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act and the 1994 and 1995 \\nUnited StatesŒCuba Migration Accords, which made it possible for Cubans (who had arrived in the United \\nStates via land) to gain permanent residence after living in the country for one year. This came to be known \\nas the ﬁwet foot, dry footﬂ policy.\\n313 Northern America314Migration in Northern America is dominated by migration into the region. As shown in ˚gure 25, over 58.6 \\nmillion migrants were residing in Northern America from a variety of regions in 2019. This number has \\nincreased by around 3 million since 2015, when around 55.6 million migrants were living in the region. \\nThe largest group was from Latin America and the Caribbean (26.6 million), followed by Asia (17.4 million) \\nand Europe (7 million). During the last 30 years, the number of migrants in Northern America has more \\nthan doubled in size, driven by emigration from Latin American and the Caribbean, and Asia, as well as by \\neconomic growth and political stability in Northern America. \\n306\\n\\n\\n\\n309\\n310\\n\\n311\\n\\n312\\n\\n\\n313\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n314\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n107The number of Northern American migrants living within the region or elsewhere was very small compared with \\nthe foreign-born population in the region.

For example, in 2000, the largest origin country of international migrants in Canada was \\nthe United Kingdom (608,000), followed by China (412,000), India (319,000) and Italy (315,000). By 2019, \\nIndia and China had surpassed the United Kingdom as the two largest origin countries, with around 709,000 \\nand nearly 700,000 migrants respectively.\\n323 Other Asian countries such as the Islamic Republic of Iran also \\nfeatured in the top 10 largest populations within Canada™s total 7.9 million total foreign-born population in \\n2019.324 In 2017, Canada admitted over 286,000 new permanent residents, with India, the Philippines and \\nChina representing the top three countries of origin.\\n325 The estimated number of irregular migrants in the United States is thought to be lower than a decade \\nago, but remains much larger when compared with Canada.\\n An estimated 10.5 million irregular migrants \\nwere living in the United States in 2017, accounting for 3.2\\n per cent of the total population.\\n326 The number \\n315\\n\\n\\n316\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n319\\n\\n\\n320\\n321\\n322\\n\\n\\n323\\n324\\n325\\n326\\n\\n112of irregular migrants has been decreasing, falling from a high of 12.2 million in 2007.\\n327 For the ˚rst time, \\nMexicans comprised less than half (47%) of all undocumented migrants in the United States.\\n328 The number \\nof Central American irregular migrants Œ most from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala \\nand Honduras Œ increased from 1.5 million in 2007 to 1.9 million in 2017.\\n329 A signi˚cant number of adult \\nirregular migrants in the United States are not new arrivals; more than 65\\n per cent of adults in 2017 had \\nlived in the United States for more than 10 years.\\n330 Irregular migrants may enter the country without \\nauthorization; however, a large number are visa overstayers who initially entered the United States regularly. \\nIn the ˚scal year 2018, for example, there were more than 600,000 foreigners who overstayed their visas \\nin the United States.\\n331 Canada also has a signi˚cant number of irregular migrants, although estimates vary \\nwidely, and accurate numbers are dif˚cult to establish. However, in the two years prior to June 2019, more \\nthan 45,000 migrants were reported to have crossed into Canada irregularly.\\n332The United States and Canada have resettled signi˚cant numbers of refugees, representing the two \\nlargest resettlement countries in the world. \\nIn 2018, Canada resettled more refugees than the United \\nStates, the ˚rst time that the United States has not taken the lead globally. Out of the 92,400 refugees \\nresettled around the world in 2018, Canada admitted around 28,000, while the United States took in a little \\nless than 23,000.\\n333 The number of refugees resettled in the United States has been declining over the last two \\nyears; in 2016, for example, the United States admitted nearly 100,000 refugees.\\n334 This number dramatically \\ndropped to 33,000 the following year.\\n335 There has also been a signi˚cant increase in the number of United \\nStates citizens applying for asylum in Canada since 2016. In 2017 alone, more than 2,500 citizens of the \\nUnited States applied for asylum in Canada,\\n336 six times the number of applications in 2016 and the highest \\nnumber on record since Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) began reporting on the number \\nof asylum seekers more than two decades ago.\\n337 The majority of asylum applications from United States™ \\ncitizens were made by children of parents without United States residency.\\n338  Immigration policies in the United States have hardened, slowing immigration in˜ows and \\nhumanitarian intakes.\\n For example, in 2018, overall visa issuances for both immigrant and non-immigrants \\ndeclined for a second year in a row.\\n339 More than 10 million non-immigrant visas were issued in 2016; by \\nthe end of 2018, this number had fallen to a little over 9 million. The United States™ travel ban Œ which \\n˚rst came into effect in January 2017 and originally included citizens of the Islamic Republic of Iran, \\nIraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen Œ has contributed to a reduction in the \\nnumber of immigrants and visitors entering the United States. After it was challenged in court, the revised \\n\\n\\n329\\n330\\n331\\n\\n\\n\\n332\\n333\\n334\\n335\\n336\\n\\n\\n339\\n\\n\\n\\n113travel ban, which added more names to the list of banned countries, came into effect in September 2017. \\nIt included the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People™s Republic of Korea, the Bolivarian Republic \\nof Venezuela, Chad, Yemen, Somalia and Libya, although Chad was later removed from the list.\\n340 The most \\ncontroversial change began in June 2018, when the Government put into effect the so-called ﬁzero-tolerance \\npolicyﬂ, applying to migrants, including asylum-seeking families crossing the United States border without \\ndocumentation. The policy was meant to serve as a punitive deterrent for irregular border crossing,\\n341 and its \\nimplementation led to the separation of over 2,600 children from their parents,\\n342 but the public outcry that \\nensued forced the Government to quickly reverse course. Tougher immigration policies have come on the back \\nof widespread anti-immigrant rhetoric, which has sought to characterize migrants as both a danger and drain \\non United States society; conspiracy theories about immigration have also been widespread, creating an \\natmosphere of mistrust and fear.\\n343 A 2018 poll found that more than half of United States citizens believed \\ntheir Government to be withholding information on the real cost of immigration to society and taxpayers.\\n344 Recent data also reveal that the number of hate crimes in the United States increased in 2017, with many \\nvictims targeted because of their race or ethnicity.\\n345 As immigration policies become more restrictive at the national level, ﬁsanctuary citiesﬂ in the United \\nStates have stepped in, offering protection to undocumented migrants whose status puts them at risk \\nof either being detained or deported. While the concept of sanctuary cities exists in other parts of the \\nworld, it is most commonly applied in the United States, where many local jurisdictions Œ such as cities, \\ncounties or States Œ are in open de˚ance of national immigration laws\\n346 and have passed legislation aimed \\nat protecting undocumented residents.\\n347 In 2018, California Œ the most populous state in the United States, \\nand with the largest number of undocumented migrants Œ signed into law statewide measures that limit local \\nlaw enforcement cooperation with federal authorities on immigration enforcement.\\n348 Sanctuary cities have \\ngenerated backlash from federal authorities, including attempts to punish jurisdictions that do not comply \\nwith federal immigration ordinances.\\n349 Oceania350In 2019, around 7.7 million international migrants from outside Oceania were living in the region. As shown \\nin ˚gure 31 the foreign-born migrant population was primarily composed of people from Asia (49%) and \\nEurope (38%). Throughout the last 30 years, the Asian migrant group has grown, while the number from \\nEurope has remained steady. \\n340\\n\\n341\\n342\\n\\n\\n343\\n\\n344\\n345\\n346\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n349\\n\\n350\\n\\n\\n\\n114Out of all of the six world regions, Oceania had the lowest number of migrants outside its region in 2019, \\npartly a re˜ection of the low total population size of the region, although there was an increase in their \\nnumber during the previous 30-year period.

Over 209,000 people were granted work visas in New Zealand in 2016/2017, \\nan increase of 9\\n per cent from 2015/2016.\\n358 The largest origin country of temporary migrant workers in New \\nZealand was India in 2016/2017, followed by the United Kingdom, China and Germany.\\n359 Both countries also \\nattract a large number of international students. The number of international students has increased since \\n2012 in Australia, reaching a record high of nearly 700,000 in 2018,\\n360 while there were over 91,000 student \\nvisa holders in New Zealand in the year 2016/2017, with most students primarily from China and India.\\n361Both Australia and New Zealand participate in refugee resettlement.\\n Australia™s refugee resettlement \\nprogramme is the third largest in the world, with nearly 13,000 refugees resettled in the country in 2018.\\n362 Under Australia™s Humanitarian Program, an additional 12,000 humanitarian places were made available in \\n2015 for people displaced by con˜icts in the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq.\\n363 The number of places under \\nAustralia™s Humanitarian Program rose to 16,250 in 2017/2018 and was expected to further increase to 18,750 \\nplace from 2018 to 2019.\\n364 Australia™s policy is to transfer those who arrive irregularly by boat as asylum \\nseekers to offshore processing centres on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and in Nauru.\\n365 In July 2013, \\nAustralia also announced that all persons arriving by boat and found to be in need of international protection \\nwould not be resettled to Australia.\\n366 As part of a 2016 bilateral resettlement arrangement between the \\nUnited States and Australia, the United States agreed to resettle up to 1,200 refugees from Nauru and Papua \\nNew Guinea™s Manus Island.\\n367 By early 2019, only around 500 refugees from these offshore processing centres \\nhad been resettled in the United States under the arrangement.\\n368 At the same time, around 1,000 of those \\nwho were transferred to Manus Island and Nauru remain there, some of whom were experiencing severe \\nphysical and mental health needs.\\n369 New Zealand is also a refugee resettlement country, resettling 1,000 \\nrefugees annually through its Refugee Quota Programme.\\n370 This also includes 250 places speci˚cally set for \\nSyrian refugees in 2016/2017 and in 2017/2018.\\n371 New Zealand has also established an additional quota of \\n300 places per year that allow extended family members of refugees in New Zealand to apply for Permanent \\nResidence.\\n372 356\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n359\\n360\\n\\n\\n\\n361\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n362\\n363\\n\\n\\n364\\n365\\n\\n\\n366\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n369\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n121Economic challenges in˜uence emigration from Paci˚c Island countries\\n. Many Paci˚c Islands continue \\nto experience persistent challenges related to poverty and inequality. The Islands™ economic growth has also \\nbeen hampered by their remoteness or vast distances between them and larger markets, limited natural \\nresources and narrowly-based economies.\\n373 Additionally, the subregion is experiencing a signi˚cant ﬁyouth \\nbulgeﬂ, with 70\\n per cent of the population in Solomon Islands, for example, under the age of 34.\\n374 This \\nhas resulted in a signi˚cant number of young people struggling with unemployment, leading to a high \\ndegree of labour emigration. Since 2007, seasonal labour migration schemes have helped to relieve labour \\nshortages in the Paci˚c Islands, with the establishment of New Zealand™s Recognised Seasonal Employer \\nscheme and Australia™s Seasonal Worker Programme in 2012, aimed at meeting labour needs, mainly in the \\nhorticulture and viticulture industries.\\n375 Over 9,600 people from the Paci˚c Islands were granted visas under \\nNew Zealand™s Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme during the 2017/2018 season and more than 8,000 \\nunder Australia™s Seasonal Worker Programme during the same season.\\n376 In 2018, a new labour scheme, \\nthe Paci˚c Labour Scheme (PLS), was established to ˚ll gaps in low- and semi-skilled jobs in both rural and \\nregional Australia.\\n377 Importantly, while Australia and New Zealand remain the major destinations for labour \\nmigrants from Paci˚c Islands, labour emigration from these Islands has diversi˚ed, with Fijians and Tongans, \\nfor example, increasingly moving to countries such as Japan.\\n378Environmental change and degradation are also among the array of factors in˜uencing many Paci˚c \\nIslanders to migrate\\n. The Paci˚c region is extremely vulnerable to natural hazards, some of which are linked \\nto climate change. Vulnerability to climate change and associated migration, displacement and planned \\nrelocation varies among Paci˚c Island countries and territories. Half the population in Kiribati and Tuvalu \\nlives in overcrowded urban areas on atolls of narrow strips of coral with limited access to water and land.\\n379 Incremental sea-level rise, saltwater intrusion and drought are important factors, among others, impacting \\npeople™s decisions to migrate in the region, both internally and internationally.\\n380 In this context, there is \\nalso growing discussion around the need for the planned relocation of groups and communities.\\n381 For example \\nKiribati, one of the States most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, promoted the ﬁMigration with \\nDignityﬂ policy as a long-term adaptation measure.\\n382 The policy aims to facilitate both permanent and \\ntemporary labour migration on a voluntary basis as a way of coping with the effects of climate change.\\n383 Meanwhile, the Government of Fiji has been relocating people from several coastal villages that have been \\nidenti˚ed as highly vulnerable to the impacts of environmental change and degradation.\\n384\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n122ConclusionThis chapter has drawn on a wide range of statistics and information to provide regional overviews of \\ninternational migration around the world, with emphasis on changes occurring in calendar years 2017 and \\n2018 (and drawing on material published up until the end June 2019). The chapter focused on six broad world \\nregions (Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Northern America and Oceania), and provided \\ndiscussion of key issues as well as recent developments at the subregional level. \\nOverall, and as is highlighted by the graphs presented at the regional level, there are clear geographic \\naspects to migration and displacement. A quick scan of ˚gures in the chapter shows visually the signi˚cant \\ndifferences in migration patterns between regions: migration in Africa has been predominantly intraregional \\n(from one African country to another) with migration also occurring to other regions of the world (from \\nAfrican to non-African countries), whereas in Latin America and the Caribbean, migration is dominated by \\nemigration to other world regions, especially Northern America, with intraregional migration playing a more \\nlimited role. \\nThe addition of two regional graphs in this edition of the \\nWorld Migration Report\\n Œ one on population change \\nover a decade and one on new internal displacements for 2018 Œ highlights and reinforces some interesting \\ndynamics at the regional level. For example, we can see that, while the most signi˚cant proportional \\npopulation change over the last decade has been mostly in terms of growth, parts of Europe have experienced \\nsigni˚cant population decline; this is exceptional globally, with no other region experiencing such results. \\nThe curious anomaly of population decline, long-term emigration trends, ageing populations and hostility \\ntoward immigration raises a number of strategic policy questions that some European countries will likely \\nface for years to come. At the same time, demographic challenges are being addressed in other parts of the \\nworld, including in several North Asian countries, which are reassessing their approaches to immigration \\nwith a keen eye to labour markets, meeting key occupation and sectoral needs and preparing further for \\nageing populations. The addition of the new internal displacement graphs highlights the stark differences \\nbetween con˜ict-related displacement and disaster displacement globally, with strong variations evident at \\nthe regional level. \\nAt the subregional level, we can see that key features may remain largely the same from year to year, \\nwith only incremental change evident. It is, however, in the examination of recent developments that we \\ncan see substantial change occurring in some areas of the world. In part, this change is due to signi˚cant \\nmigration ﬁeventsﬂ, such as the large-scale out˜ow of people from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, or \\nthe mass displacement of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. We are also seeing change occurring on migration \\ngovernance as subregions experience shifts in migration patterns and underlying population change. In North \\nAsia, for example, China established its ˚rst immigration agency, bringing together functions from a number \\nof agencies into one consolidated authority. Meanwhile, the Republic of Korea experienced large arrivals of \\nasylum seekers from the Middle East not previously seen before, prompting intense public debate on related \\npolicy issues. \\nThe regional differences and complexities, as well as recent developments, provide an important perspective \\nto understanding migration. So often, we read and hear about migration from a national perspective, most \\ncommonly in recent times portrayed as a critical (negative) domestic political issue. But this dominant focus \\ncan mask the reality that migration patterns and processes are very closely linked to geography, and that key \\nregional features developed over decades, if not centuries, continue to play a central role in how and where \\npeople migrate internationally. Greater recognition of regional and subregional migration patterns, variations \\nand complexities can assist in formulating strategic and sustainable policy responses.\\n1241254MIGRATION RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS: GROWTH, \\nREACH AND RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS \\nIntroductionIn its simplest form, public policy has been de˚ned as ﬁanything a government chooses to do or not to doﬂ.\\n1 Policymaking involves action through the setting of rules, laws, procedures, programmes, guidelines and \\nother forms of regulation. But how do States decide on what should be regulated, and what should go into \\nthose regulations? Questions of policy settings transcend political systems, although policymaking processes \\nvary across different types of systems.\\n2 The ﬁraw ingredientsﬂ of policymaking include evidence (statistics and \\nother data, research and evaluation) as well as funding, public sector capability and political dynamics.\\n3 In \\nmigration policymaking, all ingredients are important; however, in recent years, we have seen the emphasis \\non political dynamics grow, sometimes regardless of, or in contrast to, the existing evidence base. It is clear, \\ntherefore, that the raw ingredients themselves are not enough to result in evidence-based policymaking, but \\nthat the following conditions are required:\\n41. Evidence exists and is accessible to policymakers.\\n2. Policymakers are motivated to use evidence.\\n3. Policymakers have the capacity to use evidence.\\n4. Policymakers and policymaking bodies have relationships that facilitate the relevance and use of evidence.\\nThis chapter on migration research and analysis is focused on point 1 above Œ for without statistics and other \\ndata and research on migration, any attempts at evidence-based decision-making are futile. The evidence for \\npolicymaking that originates from rigorous analysis and research on migration is the prime source and starting \\npoint for migration policymakers. It is also fundamental to migration practitioners, students, scholars and \\nthe public, as they examine aspects of migration and how they might be changing. A key challenge for many \\nis how to determine the \\nrelevance\\n and \\nquality of an ever-growing body of migration research and analysis. It \\ncan often be overwhelming to identify what is important, and what should be afforded weight, when faced \\nwith virtual mountains of research output. This chapter is aimed in particular at those who would bene˚t \\nfrom some broad guidance on this topic. It provides an overview of research and analysis on migration being \\nundertaken and published by a range of actors Œ such as academics, governments, and intergovernmental \\nand non-governmental organizations Œ by building on the foundational chapter of the same name in the \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n.5 Understanding the variety, nature and characteristics of the different types \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 4 Œ \\n126of research and analysis being produced on migration is important for those working on migration policies, \\nstudying migration, or wanting to develop an informed opinion on migration. \\nIt is important to highlight at the outset that there are fundamental differences in the publishing processes \\nfor academic and non-academic material, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. The academic publishing \\nsystem is largely focused on producing journal articles and books. This process typically involves multi-stage \\nreviews and editorial comments involving authors, editors and reviewers. Most published academic research \\n(ﬁwhiteﬂ literature) is behind paywalls (that is, not freely accessible), and often managed by commercial \\npublishers. In contrast, the production of research and analysis publications outside of academic publishing \\n(ﬁgreyﬂ literature) generally involves faster and simpler processes that are typically, although not always, \\ncharacterized by more limited peer review. Contributions from grey literature (such as research reports, working \\npapers and government/of˚cial documents) are usually freely available. A report such as this, designed to \\ncontribute to our collective understanding of migration and mobility in an increasingly interconnected world, \\nwould clearly be incomplete without describing the role of grey literature, which has been ﬁrecognized as a \\nkey source of evidence, argument, innovation, and understandingﬂ.\\n6The volume, diversity and growth of both white and grey literature preclude a systematic review of all the \\nmaterial produced and published on migration in 2017 and 2018. Instead, this chapter highlights examples \\nof key contributions made during this period, published in English by a selection of academic journals and \\nintergovernmental organizations. It provides an update to the chapter in \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n, including \\nby focusing on different academic journals and intergovernmental organizations, and their key output in 2017 \\nand 2018.\\n7 The next section provides an overview of the different actors involved in migration research and \\nanalysis. The third section features recent, selected contributions from academia and intergovernmental \\norganizations, and the reach and impact of some of the migration research materials published.\\nMain producers of migration research and analysisAcademiaIdeally, researchers create new knowledge that is supported by strong evidence and is useful for others. \\nResearch ˚ndings are produced for, and disseminated to, different target audiences. Traditional academic work \\ncan be highly technical and narrowly focused, although academic researchers are increasingly encouraged \\nto disseminate their work beyond academic spheres.\\n8 Researchers analysing policy-relevant issues are often \\nkeen to engage with policymakers to impart knowledge that can inform policy deliberations and help shape \\npolicymaking Œ this is especially the case with migration. Effective research contributions for policy audiences \\ntend to take the form of short papers and blog articles, as well as policy workshops and interactive expert \\nmeetings. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n127In academia, the main focus is on publishing, with some forms (such as academic journals) having much \\ngreater credibility and weight than others. A key strength of academic publications is that they have usually \\nbeen peer reviewed by experts in the ˚eld, which typically enhances their quality. The growing number of \\npublishing outlets is, however, characterized by a wide range of peer review standards. Arguably, one of \\nthe weaknesses of academic research is that the pressure to publish has contributed to a large increase in \\nacademic output in recent years, not always of high-quality material. Appendix A provides a summary of \\nacademic publishing, including details of peer-review processes, citations and impact assessment. \\nWithin the many thousands of journals currently being produced Œ covering all disciplines, topics and research \\n˚elds\\n9 Œ we identi˚ed over 130 migration-related journals publishing in English, French or Spanish, a list of \\nwhich is published on the research page of the IOM website as a resource for students and others conducting \\nmigration research (\\nwww.iom.int/migration-research\\n). Mainstream academic publishers tend to publish in \\nEnglish, which has the advantage of standardizing outputs but the downside of excluding those who are not \\nable to submit manuscripts with an acceptable level of English. \\nRecent academic output on migration comprises mainly journal articles (see ˚gure 1). The long-term trend \\nshows a gradual increase in academic publishing on migration, which is likely to be related to both the \\ngeneral expansion of academic literature production, and the increased prominence of migration research.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n05001,0001,5002,0002,500Books\\n2018201720162015201420132012201120102009200820072006200520042003200220012000Source: \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nNote:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n128Governments\\nHistorically, government administrative data on persons entering and/or leaving a country™s territory \\nconstitute the earliest sources of information on international migration.\\n10 The earliest scholarly work on \\nmigration in the modern era, however, was on internal migration dynamics based on national census data \\ncollected by authorities in the United Kingdom.\\n11 To this day, data enumerated by population censuses, \\npopulation registers, representative surveys and other of˚cial statistical sources often constitute the basis \\nfor migration-related databases. The centrality of migration-related data within a government context is \\nrecognized, for example, by the IOM Development Fund, which supports (among other things) capacity-\\nbuilding of Member States on migration-related statistics. \\nBeyond statistical data collection, administration and reporting, some governments are also signi˚cant \\ncontributors of information on migration, particularly in the form of policy-related materials, such as \\nevaluations, studies and discussion papers. They may also commission research with partners in academia, \\napplied researchers, intergovernmental organizations and think tanks. The increasing relevance of migration \\nhas led to governments providing funding for empirical work directly (rather than indirectly through national \\nresearch councils, funds or grant bodies), thereby opening up new research areas and broadening the scope \\nof migration studies.\\n12 This has led to some criticism of government-commissioned research being overly \\nfocused on policy issues and for, at times, suggesting ﬁsimplistic, short-term remedies to complex, long-term \\nsocial issuesﬂ,13 or of researchers being used to legitimize immigration policy.\\n14 While this may be a valid \\nconcern, especially for commissioned research, governments continue to be signi˚cant funders (if not the \\nmost signi˚cant) of academic research in many countries, including of research on migration. There are, \\nhowever, different ways research is funded and supported Œ some examples are provided in table 1.\\nThere has been some evidence of researchers being pressured into ﬁproduc[ing] politically useful resultsﬂ \\nin policy-related research more generally.\\n15 Understandably, issues addressed in government-commissioned \\ndedicated migration research vary widely, and can depend on the countries™ role in the migration process.\\n16 Equally, there is recognition that policy-\\nirrelevant\\n research is also crucial Œ particularly migration research \\nthat looks beyond the policy frames of reference to explore less visible aspects of migration.\\n17 It is also \\nimportant to note that research commissioned by governments can provide useful and rigorous examinations \\nof migration Œ particularly in partnership with academic and other researchers, who can bring different \\nperspectives, knowledge and analytical approaches to the examination of complex, multi-faceted migration \\nissues, including by drawing upon administrative data that might not otherwise be accessible.\\n10\\n\\n\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n129\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n130Think tanks and governments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nb\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nf a   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Intergovernmental organizations \\nAs publishers and institutional authors, intergovernmental organizations make speci˚c contributions on \\nmigration. In some circumstances, such organizations may be the only source of information, and multiple \\nreferences to publications by intergovernmental organizations are therefore often found in academic \\nliterature. A commercially published edited volume or article on an aspect of international migration or \\ndisplacement, for example, can typically refer to material from the United Nations Department of Economic \\nand Social Affairs (UN DESA), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), IOM, the \\n131International Labour Organization (ILO), the Of˚ce of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \\nRights (OHCHR), the United Nations Children™s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Of˚ce on Drugs and Crime \\n(UNODC), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Educational, Scienti˚c \\nand Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and/or the World Bank, among others. Scholarly publications note that \\nintergovernmental organizations are now among the main producers of information on migration, which \\nre˜ects a broader growing interest in the issue of migration.\\n18 Although de˚nitions of intergovernmental organizations may vary, Davies and Woodward de˚ne the term \\nas ﬁformal, continuous structures founded by an authoritative instrument of agreement between members \\n(including two or more sovereign states) or an existing international organization through which members \\npursue their common interestﬂ.\\n19 Since the ˚rst half of the last century, the number, diversity and in˜uence \\nof intergovernmental organizations have grown,\\n20 so much so that a systematic review of contributions on \\nmigration by such organizations is well beyond the scope of this chapter. The focus of this chapter is on \\nglobal contributors within the United Nations system Œ UN DESA, UNHCR, IOM, ILO, OHCHR, UNICEF, UNODC, UNDP, \\nUNESCO and the World Bank Œ which in no way diminishes the work of other organizations, including those \\noperating at a regional or national level.\\n21 As programmes or units within the principal organs of the United \\nNations or semi-autonomous, specialized or related agencies, the intergovernmental organizations discussed \\nin this chapter all have global reach, access to the inputs and expertise of diverse stakeholders and, in some \\ncases, global operations that enable them to shape discourse and practice on migration and mobility. \\nThe mandates, missions or competencies of some of the organizations (such as IOM and UNHCR) are focused \\non speci˚c forms of migration and displacement, while others have responsibilities relevant to particular \\naspects or groups of people: UN DESA for data; ILO for migrant workers; OHCHR for migrants™ rights; UNICEF \\nfor migrant children; UNODC for transnational criminal aspects (such as human traf˚cking and migrant \\nsmuggling); UNDP for migration and development; UNESCO for the educational, scienti˚c and cultural aspects \\nof migration; and the World Bank for economic implications of migration. Their various mandates enable \\nsuch intergovernmental organizations to collect signi˚cant quantities of data and/or access data from States. \\nMany of these organizations also convene and report on dialogues and conferences related to migration \\nand mobility, in addition to generating and publishing background, technical, operational, state-of-the-art \\nand agenda-setting research and analysis, including on global statistical data. As with other publishers, \\nintergovernmental organizations are not immune to criticism related to quality, framing and agenda-setting. \\nHowever, there is clearly also recognition of the responsibility of producing rigorous and robust data and \\nresearch. Intergovernmental organizations, for example, routinely work in collaboration with leading \\nmigration-related data analysts and researchers as a means of drawing on critical skills and expertise. \\nGiven the cross-cutting nature of migration, research on the topic is often undertaken jointly by \\nintergovernmental organizations. Many publications were released under the aegis of the Global Migration \\nGroup (GMG) which, prior to its transition in late 2018 to the United Nations Network on Migration, consisted \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\n20\\n21\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n132of 22 member agencies working on migration.\\n22 The importance of collaborative research on migration was \\nrecently highlighted in the report of the United Nations Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) \\nStrengthening Policy \\nResearch Uptake in the Context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\\n, published in 2018.\\n23 While \\nthe report is more broadly concerned with policy research within the United Nations system, it features a case \\nstudy on migration that maps collaboration on migration research among 14 JIU participating organizations, \\nas well as IOM (see the text box below). \\nCollaborative research on migration in the United Nations systemExcerpt of the JIU report \\nStrengthening Policy Research Uptake in the Context of the 2030 Agenda for \\nSustainable Development\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n133\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUNRISDESCWA\\nESCAP\\nOCHAUNU(GMG)UNDESA\\nUNCTAD\\nUNDPUNHCRIOMUNESCO\\nILO\\nFAO\\nWFPUN WOMEN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n134\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIOM produces a large number of research and analysis publications on migration. Given the Organization™s \\nfocus on the provision of technical assistance and direct support to migrants and Member States, publications \\nproduced by IOM outside the realm of research and analysis typically include corporate reports (such as \\nmeeting/workshop reports and \\nMigration Initiatives\\n), training materials, handbooks and guides, and \\ninformation materials for migrants (including graphic novels). It is worth acknowledging the mandate and \\ncontext within which IOM operates, as well as its status as a United Nations-related organization.\\n24 IOM™s \\nrole as a service delivery agency over almost 70 years has necessarily shaped how it articulates aspects of \\nmigration, including the links between its operations and migration practice, as well as migration policy \\nand governance. Programmatic data, for example, have been a mainstay of IOM migration data Œ a re˜ection \\nof IOM™s strong and enduring role in migration and displacement, including, for example, the support of \\ninternally displaced persons, the resettlement of refugees globally, health assessments, assistance to victims \\nof human traf˚cking, and support to migrants returning home. Concomitantly, IOM has long recognized the \\nneed to support more nuanced understandings of migration, including through its focus on speci˚c thematic \\nareas, such as migration health and environmental migration. \\nRecent contributions: 2017 and 2018 in focus \\nHaving described the main producers of migration research and analysis, we now turn to a discussion of \\nexamples of recent contributions by academia and intergovernmental organizations. \\nAcademia\\nThe large number of scholarly publications on migration precludes a review of all material published in 2017 \\nand 2018. We instead examine a sample of contributions from the scholarly community, focusing on eight \\npeer-reviewed migration-related journals. The previous edition of the \\nWorld Migration Report\\n featured different \\njournals, as will future ones. For this chapter, we focused on the \\nInternational Journal of Migration and Border \\nStudies, International Migration\\n, the \\nInternational Migration Review\\n, the \\nJournal of Immigrant and Refugee \\n24\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n135Studies, the \\nJournal on Migration and Human Security\\n, Migration Studies\\n, the \\nRefugee Survey Quarterly\\n, and \\nthe \\nRevue européenne des migrations internationales\\n.25 The examination comprised two components: analysis \\nof all article titles published by these journals in 2017 and 2018 (totalling 493 articles); and editors™ overviews \\nof their journals™ key contributions for this two-year period. This exercise allowed for deeper insights into \\njournal contributions, highlighting their similarities as well as different interests and areas of focus, including \\nthematically and geographically. Each editor™s overview is provided in full in appendix B. Excerpts of journal \\neditors™ overviews are included in text boxes throughout the remainder of this chapter.\\nAll journal editors emphasized the importance of rigorous and high-quality research on migration; however, \\nrelevance of scienti˚c/academic writings for policymakers emerged as an important aspect for only some \\njournals. Two editors emphasized the importance of contributions tackling policy-relevant issues in the ˚eld \\nof migration (Gamlen and Chetail Œ see appendix B). This was noted as expanding the ﬁgrowing community of \\nmigration expertsﬂ who are in turn ﬁcontributing to public life by informing and impacting the thoughts and \\ndecisions of politicians, policymakers and practitioners of migration policy at every level, from local NGOs, to \\nmunicipal governments, to national governments and international organizationsﬂ (Gamlen Œ see appendix \\nB). In addition, policymakers were speci˚cally identi˚ed as falling within the target audience of two other \\njournals (Duncan and Kerwin Œ see appendix B). The content of these journals is designed to appeal to a \\npolicy audience: one journal requires each contribution to start with an executive summary and set out a \\nseries of policy recommendations at the end (Kerwin Œ see appendix B), while the other journal introduced \\noccasional interviews with senior policy of˚cials (Duncan Œ see appendix B).\\nMigration Studies\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n \\nThe analysis of the thematic focus of articles published in the selected journals in 2017 and 2018 in part \\nrelates to the speci˚c, narrower focus of some of the journals. The \\nRefugee Survey Quarterly\\n, for example, is \\nprimarily on refugee research (Chetail Œ see appendix B), while the \\nJournal of Immigrant and Refugee Studies\\n covers labour migrants and asylum seekers/refugees (Triandafyllidou Œ see appendix B).

Œ see appendix B). \\nNevertheless, the topics covered in the articles published in these eight journals in 2017 and 2018 are \\ndiverse and address complex migration issues. They also re˜ect new developments and trends in migration, \\nacknowledging some delay effect due to the time frame required for peer review and publication (Duncan \\nŒ see appendix B). For instance, among the 2017 and 2018 contributions, only three articles addressed the \\nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and the Global Compact on Refugees initiated in \\nSeptember 2016 by the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants and adopted in December 2018. We \\nexpect that many more articles on the two compacts will be published in 2019 and 2020 (and beyond).\\nInternational Migration\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n \\n\\n\\nThat said, two main themes re˜ecting complex migration issues emerge from editors™ contributions. The \\n˚rst topic is irregular migration, including in relation to border controls and enforcement. Editors of three \\njournals identi˚ed this theme as particularly salient in the 2017 and 2018 contributions, covering issues \\nranging from human traf˚cking (Triandafyllidou Œ see appendix B), to border violence (Ma Ming and Petit Œ \\nsee appendix B), or detention and deportation (Kerwin Œ see appendix B). As ﬁasylum and migration have \\nbecome increasingly blurred in the past decades in both policy and practiceﬂ, this topic was also addressed in \\nresearch on forced migration, most notably through the securitization of asylum and the detention of asylum \\nseekers (Chetail Œ see appendix B). \\nRevue européenne des migrations internationales \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n137\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nThe second topic of convergence across the selected articles is migrants™ inclusion, which was identi˚ed by \\neditors of four journals as a prominent thematic focus in 2017 and 2018 (Gamlen, Triandafyllidou, Winders \\net al., and Ma Mung and Petit Œ see appendix B). The diversity of issues related to inclusion addressed in \\nthese four journals re˜ects the complexity of the topic. Contributions to the \\nJournal of Immigrant and \\nRefugee Studies analysed integration processes, including the role of non-governmental and governmental \\norganizations, integration barriers and the gender dimension of integration (Triandafyllidou Œ see appendix \\nB). The issue of labour market incorporation was more particularly examined in \\nMigration Studies\\n, together \\nwith wider adaptation processes in terms of class, capital accumulation and happiness (Gamlen Œ see appendix \\nB). The \\nInternational Migration Review\\n featured articles on assimilation, economic mobility and interpersonal \\ncontacts (Winders et al. Œ see appendix B), while contributions to the \\nRevue européenne des migrations \\ninternationales \\napproached inclusion through migrants™ perspectives. \\nJournal of Immigrant and Refugee Studies \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n \\n\\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of the 493 articles published in 2017 and 2018 in the selected journals \\naccording to their geographic focus.

Broadening the geographical coverage \\nof contributions to provide more articles on developing country issues was described as a new approach by \\none editor to better account for the fact that ﬁthe vast majority of refugees are hosted in the Global Southﬂ \\n(Chetail Œ see appendix B). Editors of two other journals noted that increasing the geographic scope of \\narticles was an objective for their journals (Kerwin and Winders et al.

This is not surprising, since research funding and capacities are concentrated in the North.ﬂ\\n27 \\nThe concentration of research funding in wealthy industrialized States not only affects the geographic focus \\nof research, it also acts to build research skills and capacities within donor countries at the expense of \\ndeveloping country researchers.\\n28 For example, while there were some 3,000 researchers for every 1\\n million \\npeople in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries as of 2007, fewer than \\n50 researchers for every 1\\n million persons were accounted for in sub-Saharan Africa.\\n29Refugee Survey Quarterly\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n \\n\\n\\nA geographic comparison of the primary af˚liations of authors as reported in the articles they published in \\nthe selected journals in 2017 and 2018 con˚rms that a disproportionately high number of contributors are \\nfrom institutions in developed countries (see ˚gure 3). Of the 917 authors, 84 per cent were af˚liated with \\ninstitutions in developed countries. Almost 43 per cent were af˚liated with institutions based in Europe, and \\n36 per cent in Northern America.

Accordingly, special attention was paid by IJMBS to the concept of \\ntransit as a space constructed through mobility restrictions regimes and the above-mentioned \\nsystems of reciprocal conditionalities.Source:\\n\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n141Plan S: The future of open access for scientific research? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond the selected journals, it is likely that this uneven distribution re˜ects the broader state of migration \\nresearch. In 2015, professor Jørgen Carling compiled a list of ﬁtopﬂ migration researchers who have published \\nextensively in leading migration journals, concluding: ﬁIt™s striking that there™s not a single person on the list \\nbased in Africa or Latin America. And the six people based in Asia are all working in countries of immigration. \\nThis geographical bias continues to be a major challenge for migration research.ﬂ\\n31 As the interest in migration has increased, and the amount of migration research and analysis material \\nhas grown, it would be reasonable to expect that the reach (through expanding readerships, for example) \\n31\\n142has also increased. One indicator Œ though extensively criticized Œ in academic publishing is a journal™s \\nImpact Factor.\\n32 However, Impact Factors were available for only three of the selected journals (\\nInternational \\nMigration\\n, International Migration Review\\n and \\nMigration Studies\\n). Taking into consideration these three \\njournals, together with those examined in the \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n, there appears to have been an \\nincrease (see ˚gure 4). The recent average Impact Factor increase suggests that the articles published in these \\njournals are receiving more attention: citing a paper reasonably implies that it has been read, and that some \\nof its content was helpful in adding to the evidence base and/or generating debates, building knowledge, or \\ninforming migration policy and practice. \\n\\n\\n\\n 0.00.51.01.52.02.5Average\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n201820172016201520142013201220112010\\nSource: \\n \\n Note:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublication metrics based on citation counts (including the Impact Factor) clearly have various limitations \\nand downsides.\\n33 First, citations tend to accumulate slowly, given academic publishing timelines and the \\ntime it takes to compile/release statistics. Second, citations are a matter almost solely within the academic \\ncontext, which is one reason alternative measures (discussed below) have been developed. Third, citations \\ndo not measure quality of material, but are a way of quantifying impact (see the discussion on this point in \\n32\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n33\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n143appendix A). While citation metrics have become a priority for academic publishers and scholars, they are \\nlikely to be less relevant to people outside academia. \\nNew metrics are being developed for scholarly publications to assess their impact outside of academia. One \\nsuch metric is the Altmetric Attention Score,\\n34 indicating ﬁhow many people have been exposed to and \\nengaged with a scholarly outputﬂ.\\n35 For any research output, the Attention Score ﬁprovides an indicator of the \\namount of attention that it has receivedﬂ,\\n36 with some sources having more weight than others. For instance, \\ncoverage in the news has the highest weight of 8, since ﬁit™s easy to imagine that the average newspaper \\nstory is more likely to bring attention to the research output than the average tweetﬂ.\\n37 Other high-weight \\nsources include blogs (5), Wikipedia (3), policy documents (3) and Twitter (1). Altmetrics are relatively \\nnew, having commenced in 2012. They have been recognized as ﬁtools that aim to measure the real-time \\nreach and in˜uence of an academic articleﬂ.\\n38 Academics found ﬁpositive but relatively weak correlation with \\ncitationsﬂ,\\n39 supporting the idea that ﬁcitation and altmetrics indicators track related but distinct impactsﬂ.\\n40 Mentions in blogs are particularly ﬁable to identify highly cited publicationsﬂ\\n41 Œ an empirical ˚nding that \\nsupports the important weight assigned to blogs within the altmetric algorithm, further highlighting the \\nincreasing importance of this form of dissemination of scienti˚c material. \\nWe have analysed views/downloads and the Altmetric Attention Score of 410 peer-reviewed articles published \\nin 2017 and 2018 by six of the eight journals under consideration in this chapter (\\nInternational Journal of \\nMigration and Border Studies\\n and \\nRevue européenne des migrations internationales\\n were not publishing these \\ndata at the time of writing). The Attention Score was chosen for two main reasons: (a) ˚rst, it was freely \\navailable on all the journal publishers™ websites; (b) second, the available evidence supports its use, especially \\nfor tracking recent research output.\\n42 The analysis allowed us to unveil quantitative aspects of academic \\npublications on migration, such as how many were mentioned, viewed and/or downloaded. Table\\n 2 shows the \\ntop 10 articles with the highest Altmetric Attention Score for the selected journals in April 2019. The high \\nscores obtained by these articles, however, does not re˜ect the Altmetric Score of the 410 sampled articles. \\nOnly 21 articles (5%) scored higher than 20 Œ roughly the equivalent of one mention in the news and one in \\na blog plus ˚ve tweets. The largest share of scholarly articles (172 or 42%) had a score from 2 to 20. However, \\n75 articles (18%) had a score of 2 or lower Œ meaning that they attracted, at most, the equivalent of a couple \\nof tweets Œ and 142 articles (35%) scored zero, as they were not mentioned online by any source. This relates \\nin part to the fact that they are recently published, and we would expect to see some articles attract more \\nattention over time. \\n34 See \\n35 See \\n36\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\n41\\n\\n\\n\\n42\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n144\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n139\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n125\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n101\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n50\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n45\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n35\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n34Note: \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConcerning article views and downloads, not all journals provide such data on their websites.

Four journals (\\nInternational Journal of Migration and Border Studies, \\nInternational Migration\\n, International Migration Review\\n, and \\nRevue européenne des migrations internationales\\n) were not showing any data on article views or downloads. To overcome this lack of standardization, we \\naggregated views and downloads. Figure 5 shows the distribution of views/downloads of 181 articles from the \\nfour available sources, grouped by hundreds. As for the articles of the seven journals examined in the \\nWorld \\nMigration Report 2018\\n,43 the skewed shape of the distribution Œ similar to the Attention Score Œ highlights \\na relatively low level of reach. Only 24 articles (13%) were viewed/downloaded more than 1,000 times. The \\nviews/downloads data indicate that most academic writings have fairly limited readership.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n051015202530353400-35002900-30002400-25001900-20001400-1500900-1000400-5000-100\\n3,400Œ3,500\\n2,900Œ3,000\\n2,400Œ2,500\\n1,900Œ2,000\\n1,400Œ1,500900Œ1,000400Œ5000Œ100Source:\\n \\n\\n\\nNote: \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn summary, our quantitative analysis shows that migration as a topic is receiving increasing attention: the \\ngrowing number of publications and citations are a sign of heightened interest, at least within the academic \\ncommunity. Measures of views/downloads and Altmetrics suggest that there is room for improving the reach \\nand readership of scholarly production on migration. One of the main obstacles to this is the fact that \\nacademic publications tend to be behind paywalls, signi˚cantly limiting access to material beyond academia. \\nJournal subscribers, for example, are often academic institutions, and the cost of downloading single articles \\n43\\n146for non-subscribers can be prohibitive. Open access for academic publications enables free downloads, but \\nusually requires publisher fees to be paid by the author or their institution. More open-access journals (such \\nas Comparative Migration Studies\\n and \\nAnti-Traf˜cking Review\\n) have, however, been publishing on migration.\\n44 In addition, academic language and writing style tend to be more technical than in other areas of publishing, \\nand the topics tend to be narrower. Dissemination of ˚ndings, however, through both traditional and newer \\nforms of media, offer opportunities for academic research on migration to inform public and policy discourses. \\nThe potential reach of blogs on migration, for example, is discussed further below.\\nJournal on Migration and Human Security \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n \\n\\n\\n Intergovernmental organizations \\nThe contributions of key United Nations organizations working on migration re˜ect mandates as well as \\ncurrent trends and issues in migration.

The Population Division maintains the United Nations Global \\nMigration Database Œ the most complete set of statistics on international migrants enumerated in countries \\nor areas, and classi˚ed by age, sex and country or area of birth or citizenship Œ as well as a smaller data set \\nwith annual data on international migration ˜ows for 45 countries. \\nAs a United Nations agency with a mandate to pursue protection, assistance and solutions for refugees, \\nUNHCR produces a wealth of publications and has a dedicated research repository Œ refworld. Released \\nannually in June, \\nGlobal Trends\\n47 is one of UNHCR™s ˜agship publications. It presents and analyses annual \\ntrends worldwide in relation to refugee and other populations of concern to UNHCR. UNHCR is also the key \\nsource of global statistics on refugees and other populations of concern, as reported in its online Population \\nStatistics Database.\\nILO is a standard-setting body responsible for coordinating the development and supervising the \\nimplementation of international labour standards. In the context of its efforts to improve the collection \\nand production of labour migration statistics, \\nILO Global Estimates on International Migrant Workers\\n48 provides estimates of the proportion of labour migrant workers among the total number of migrants worldwide. \\nIn 2017, it also published a report entitled \\nAddressing Governance Challenges in a Changing Labour Migration \\nLandscape\\n49 to inform the development of just and effective governance of labour migration. In addition to \\nlabour migration data, the ILOSTAT database contains diverse statistics related to the labour market which \\nare also relevant to labour migration.\\nPart of the United Nations Secretariat, OHCHR is the principal United Nations of˚ce mandated to promote \\nand protect the human rights of all persons, including migrants. In addition to supporting United Nations \\nhuman rights mechanisms, such as treaty bodies and Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council, OHCHR \\nproduces a wealth of relevant materials. As co-chair of the former GMG Working Group on Migration, Human \\nRights and Gender, it led the development of the \\nPrinciples and Guidelines, Supported by Practical Guidance, \\non the Human Rights Protection of Migrants in Vulnerable Situations\\n.50 These \\nPrinciples and Guidelines\\n offer \\nguidance to States on the operationalization of international human rights law to protect migrants who ˚nd \\nthemselves in vulnerable situations but do not fall into the legal category of ﬁrefugeeﬂ. They are explicitly \\nreferred to in the Global Compact for Migration to ﬁ[d]evelop national policies and programmes to improve \\nnational responses that address the needs of migrants in situations of vulnerabilityﬂ.\\n51Although UNICEF™s ˜agship publication Œ the \\nState of the World™s Children\\n52 Œ does not necessarily single out \\nmigrant children, in 2017 UNICEF published \\nA Child Is a Child: Protecting Children on the Move from Violence, \\n45\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\n\\n49\\n50\\n51\\n\\n52\\n149Abuse and Exploitation\\n.53 It examines the risks faced by migrant children because of the lack of safe and legal \\nmigration pathways, and sets out some policy recommendations to better protect them. \\nWithin its mandate to assist States in addressing international crimes, UNODC undertakes efforts to combat \\ntransnational organized crime, including human traf˚cking and migrant smuggling, and produces a variety of \\nreports on these themes. The fourth \\nGlobal Report on Traf˜cking in Persons\\n,54 published in 2018, provides an \\noverview of patterns and ˜ows of traf˚cking in persons, and is based primarily on traf˚cking cases detected \\nfrom 2014 to 2016. In 2018, UNDOC released its ˚rst \\nGlobal Study on Smuggling of Migrants\\n,55 which gives an \\naccount of the magnitude and functioning of migrants™ smuggling, the pro˚les of the people involved, and the \\nrisks faced by migrants. UNODC also maintains a Smuggling of Migrants Knowledge Portal on information to \\nsupport the implementation of the 2000 United Nations Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, \\nSea and Air, Supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime\\n56 (such as \\ncase law, annotated bibliography and legislation). \\nAs the United Nations global development agency, UNDP™s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals \\ntranslates into a broad range of programmes, including for building long-term development responses to \\nmigration and displacement. In 2017, UNDP issued a report, together with the Overseas Development Institute \\n(ODI), entitled \\nClimate Change, Migration and Displacement\\n,57 which seeks to shed light on the complex \\nconnections between climate change and human mobility. \\nUNESCO™s mandate is focused on building peace by means of education, culture and science. The 2019 edition \\nof its annual \\nGlobal Education Monitoring Report\\n58 series focuses on migration and displacement. It analyses \\nthe impact of human mobility on the education systems and the way these systems can help address the \\nchallenges posed by human mobility, offering examples of successful policies. \\nAs a United Nations specialized agency and a major international ˚nancial institution, the World Bank \\npublishes a variety of books, reports and working papers on the importance of migration for growth and \\neconomic prosperity, and monitors data on migration and remittances, such as remittances in˜ows and \\nout˜ows. It issues regular Migration and Development Briefs on topical issues, the two most recent ones \\ndealing with transit and return migration. The Policy Research Report entitled \\nMoving for Prosperity: Global \\nMigration and Labor Markets\\n,59 released in 2018, analyses the apparent tension between academic ˚ndings on \\nthe social and economic bene˚ts of migration, and the antimigration public discourse. \\nKey global material was also published in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inter-agency collaboration. Prior to \\nits transition into the United Nations Network on Migration, GMG produced publications covering various \\ntopics relating to migration, often taking the form of handbooks and guidelines.\\n60 In 2017, it published a \\nhandbook to support Member States in the production and use of data on migration for development purposes \\n(produced by UN-Women). It also released a report examining the question of remittances and migrant \\n53\\n54\\n55\\n56\\n\\n\\n59\\n60\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n150women™s ˚nancial inclusion (produced by KNOMAD, World Bank). Another key publication resulting from \\ninter-agency collaboration is the \\nG20 International Migration and Displacement Trends Report 2018\\n61 produced \\nby OECD,\\n62 jointly with ILO, IOM and UNHCR. The report presents migration trends and policy challenges in \\nG20 countries and Member States of the European Union.\\n63IOMIOM published a wide range of research and analysis materials in 2017 and 2018 Œ most notably in the form of \\nstand-alone studies and reports, many of which stemmed directly from speci˚c projects and often produced \\nlocally by IOM missions. For example, the report \\nMaking Mobility Work for Adaptation to Environmental \\nChanges: Results from the MECLEP Global Research\\n64 is the ˚nal publication of the European Union-funded \\nMigration, Environment and Climate Change: Evidence for Policy (MECLEP) project assessing the evidence base \\non migration and climate change in the six countries involved in the project: the Dominican Republic, Haiti, \\nKenya, Mauritius, Papua New Guinea and Viet Nam.\\nThe text box below lists key publications produced by IOM in 2017 and 2018. In 2017, IOM released its \\nbiennial ˜agship publication, the \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n.65 In 2018, the Organization also revitalized \\nits \\nMigration Research Series\\n, which publishes policy-relevant research and analysis on diverse and complex \\nmigration issues. Calls for abstracts were circulated in 2018 on topics addressed in the \\nWorld Migration \\nReport 2018 to further stimulate research and analysis, and three papers were published. Additionally, three \\nMigration Pro˚les were issued in 2017 and ˚ve in 2018. They provide country-speci˚c migration overviews \\n(largely funded by IOM™s Development Fund) to support, among other things, capacity-building on migration \\ndata, and research and analysis in Member States.

We found that the long-term trend of increased output of migration research was further extended \\nin 2017 and 2018, which saw the largest amount ever of academic output on migration published  in 2017 \\nand equalled in 2018 (see ˚gure 1). Further, these two years saw tremendous activity by intergovernmental \\norganizations, with a large number of global reports on aspects of migration having been published (see \\ntable\\n 3 for examples).  \\nThe increase in material published is undoubtedly related to the salience of migration in policy, political \\nas well as public spheres. We have witnessed the increasing use of migration Œ or more correctly at times, \\nanti-immigration Œ as a political tool, despite the existing evidence base showing that there has not been \\nsubstantive changes in migration (levels or processes) to warrant such signi˚cant shifts in the public debate \\n(see chapter 5 of this report for discussion). It is understandable that researchers, working on academic or \\napplied research, or in white or grey literature, have been inspired to seek and report the truth during a \\nperiod in which we witnessed ﬁfake newsﬂ and ﬁdisinformationﬂ increasingly take hold in public debates on \\nmigration globally. \\n156Consistent with the ˚ndings of \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n, there is certainly a strong case to be made \\nfor playing to the strengths of the different types of research published on migration. Some of the highest \\nquality blogs on migration, for example, are based on carefully elaborated and conducted studies, and \\ninsightful analysis drawing on years of research. They also are able to garner signi˚cant interest, with data \\nclearly showing extended reach to wider audiences that lay beyond the scienti˚c. The use of blog platforms \\nby in˜uential migration academics to communicate their empirical and theoretical research ˚ndings to policy \\nand general audiences demonstrates the relevance of the form. We are also seeing recognition of this in the \\ncalculation of how research impact is measured.  The growing use of altmetrics, for example, which measure a \\njournal article™s reach in non-academic publishing, points to the increasing need to extend knowledge based \\non rigorous research and analysis into wider audiences. However, this should not be at the expense of the \\nbedrock provided by scienti˚c research, with its focus on meeting high quality standards. \\nIn this chapter we examined research and analysis output from a geographic perspective for the ˚rst time. \\nPrevious IOM research projects conducted in partnership with academic and applied researchers around \\nthe world had brought disparities into sharp relief.\\n68 Our examination of the selected journals and IOM \\npublications for 2017 and 2018 showed that there are indeed signi˚cant differences in focus, volume and \\nauthor af˚liation when published material is analysed by geographic region. As we have commented elsewhere, \\nthis is undoubtedly related to research funding sources (direct and indirect), with most sources emanating \\nfrom wealthier countries. More effort, on a sustained basis, is needed to better support research institutions \\nand researchers in developing countries, including by confronting some of the structural impediments that \\nexists to funding and capacity. Analysis of IOM™s own research publications con˚rmed anecdotal evidence that \\nan important part of IOM™s role is its focus on research concerning parts of the developing world, especially \\nin Africa.  Even greater effort to support research in developing States, however, is warranted as the vast \\nmajority of countries around the world work toward the implementation of the Global Compact for Migration \\nŒ endeavours that would greatly bene˚t from the input of academic and applied researchers.\\nFinally, we again encourage policymakers, practitioners, researchers and others to access and digest the great \\nwealth of written material on migration with a critical eye. We also underscore the importance of activities \\nand initiatives that bring together migration scholars, practitioners and policymakers, including through \\nworkshops, conferences, brie˚ng sessions and related consultations. While it may be dif˚cult at times to \\ndo so, bridging the gaps that exist between policy, practice and research when done thoughtfully can reap \\nenormous dividends for all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPART II\\nCOMPLEX AND EMERGING MIGRATION ISSUES\\nCOMPLEX AND EMERGING MIGRATION ISSUES\\n160MARIE MCAULIFFE\\nBINOD KHADRIA\\n161MARIE MCAULIFFE\\nBINOD KHADRIA\\n5REFLECTIONS ON MIGRANTS™ CONTRIBUTIONS \\nIN AN ERA OF INCREASING DISRUPTION AND \\nDISINFORMATION\\n1IntroductionA glance through previous World Migration Reports, and other policy and scienti˚c publications on international \\nmigration, shows that at least two observations have been prevalent over time: i) recognition that migration, \\nparticularly immigration, has emerged as a prominent international and national policy issue; and ii) that the \\npublic discourse on migration has increasingly become polarized with the space for balanced, rigorous, and \\nevidence-based analyses having diminished over time.\\n2 While the nature of the public discourse has changed \\nover time, there is widespread recognition that the ﬁtoxicityﬂ of the migration debate has further intensi˚ed \\nover the last few years, with the politics of fear and division increasingly framing discussions.\\n3 Disruption and \\ndisinformation are increasingly being deployed as part of tactical pursuits of power, with negative impacts on \\npublic, political and social media discourse, on societal values, and on public policy issues such as migration, \\ndisplacement and migrants (including refugees).\\n4In the face of often negatively skewed discussions on migration and migrants, one can lose sight of the fact \\nthat human endeavours to improve peace and prosperity in modern times that are underpinned by migration \\nhave been on the whole successful, and in speci˚c key areas \\nvery\\n successful (such as the eradication or \\ncontrol of speci˚c, deadly diseases and the dramatic decline in infant mortality following the efforts of \\nNations under the 2000Œ2015 Millennium Development Goals).\\n5 Migrants provide a source of dynamism \\nglobally, and are overrepresented in innovation and patents, arts and sciences awards, start-ups and successful \\ncompanies. Such historical and contemporary contributions have become increasingly overlooked or ignored \\nin recent discussions on international migration, with many contributions being ﬁnormalizedﬂ over time but \\nnevertheless evident (at times conspicuously so).\\nIt is also easy to lose sight of the fact that international migration remains a relatively uncommon phenomenon, \\nwith a mere 3.5\\n per cent of the world™s population being international migrants (see chapter 2 of this \\nreport for details). Notwithstanding this small proportion, the total number of international migrants has \\nincreased in recent decades to reach as high as 272 million, or close to the national population of Indonesia \\n(269 million).6 What we currently know is that mobility, as opposed to migration, is becoming much more \\nprevalent, making some argue that now is the time to rethink how we conceptualize and discuss these issues.\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 5 Œ \\n162In this context, revisiting the many ways in which migrants have contributed Œ at the transnational, \\nnational and local levels Œ is important in presenting a balanced discussion on migration. This is not to \\nsuggest that international migration and displacement do not pose challenges for communities in origin, \\ntransit and destination countries (as well as migrants) Œ many other chapters in this report are focused on \\nsuch challenges. However, in writing this chapter, we acknowledge that the many ways in which migrants \\ncontribute to societies are currently being overlooked, downplayed or taken for granted, and it is the purpose \\nof this chapter to bring these contributions of migrants to the forefront.\\nThe next section describes key concepts related to contributions, providing an analytical framework for this \\nchapter in the context of a rich body of academic and policy work on the topic. We then go on to describe \\nand analyse migrants™ contributions globally, with reference to sociocultural, civicŒpolitical and economic \\naspects. The chapter then discusses emerging impediments to the recognition of migrants™ contributions \\nglobally, before outlining the implications for policy deliberations and for further research. \\nWhat are ﬁcontributionsﬂ?To contribute means to give something Œ money, time, ideas, labour, material goods Œ in order to achieve \\nsomething with other people.\\n8 Outside of personal relationships, such as those with family and friends, and \\nin the context of sociology and social change theory, ﬁcontributionsﬂ are part of broader interactions and \\nengagement with individuals, groups and institutions in society. In other words, contributions occur as part \\nof broader structural settings and social processes that support and shape societies. They can be broadly \\ncategorized as being in sociocultural, civicŒpolitical or economic domains (see text box for de˚nitions). \\nSociocultural\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSources\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the salience of migration has risen in public policy and research spheres, there has been a new and greater \\nfocus on migrants per se Œ as distinct subpopulations within larger national populations, with reference to \\nthe structural settings they encounter, especially in the destination countries.\\n9  The way in which people \\nenter, stay and settle in a new country occupies the time of an increasing number of researchers, policymakers \\nand those in the media:\\n10 the ˚rst focusing on understanding the demographic, geographic, economic, legal/\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n163policy and other factors;\\n11 the second on how best to meet policy objectives (however de˚ned); and the third \\nscrutinizing and commenting on both. Research continues to explore the dynamic relationships that exist \\nbetween migrants (including potential migrants) and migration processes and related factors. We know from \\nexisting evidence and analysis, for example, that the contributions migrants are able to make in destination \\nas well as origin settings do partly depend on legalŒpolicy frameworks, such as those impacting the ability of \\nboth regular and irregular migrants to stay, participate in civic activities, work lawfully and send remittances, \\nas well as to return home (see chapter 6 of this report).\\n12 Contributions are also related to demographic \\nand socioeconomic characteristics, with those who choose to migrate having higher skills, education and \\nopportunity, ultimately also re˜ecting a greater likelihood of contributing in origin and destination countries \\nin a variety of ways.\\n13Consistent with migration research more generally (see chapter 4 of this report), there is recognition that much \\nof the analysis on migrants has been undertaken from a destination country perspective,\\n14 with some arguing \\nthat the most signi˚cant immigration country in the world Œ the United States Œ has disproportionately \\nin˜uenced the study of migrants globally.\\n15 With this in mind, this chapter attempts to re˜ect broader \\nexperiences of international migrants™ contributions by incorporating recent research and analysis focusing \\non destination \\nand\\n origin.\\n16 In scoping and presenting the chapter in this way, we acknowledge that we are \\nnot seeking to summarize all existing literature, nor are we suggesting that the ˚ndings highlighted in the \\nchapter are representative. What we do recognize, however, is the importance of encapsulating a reasonable \\ngeographic and thematic \\ndiversity\\n of research and analysis on the topic in what, after all, would make a \\nmigration report truly a \\nWorld \\nMigration Report.\\nImportantly, this chapter does not assess the overall impacts of migration in these settings. Studies on \\nthe impacts of migration are numerous and well documented (see examples in the text box below);\\n17 they \\nprovide important insights and analyses. This body of work is focused mainly on economic impacts rather \\nthan sociocultural or civicŒpolitical impacts, including because economic variables are to a greater extent \\nstandardized, thereby supporting comparative analysis. Some examples of recent publications on the economic \\nimpacts of migration, including some empirical estimates, are included in the text box below. \\n11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n164Assessing the economic impacts of migration\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na Ł \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Ł \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc Ł \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Ł \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n165The next section of this chapter discusses sociocultural contributions, and is followed by sections covering \\ncivicŒpolitical and then economic contributions. The chapter then examines recent evidence on how public \\nmigration debates are changing, including through the (mis)use of social media platforms for misinformation \\nand disruption with transnational reach. The ˚nal concluding section summarizes the implications of current \\nevidence for policy, practice and research.\\nMigrants™ sociocultural contributionsThe sociocultural contributions of migrants are felt by many of us on a daily basis, even though we may \\nnot be conscious of it. Simple activities Œ such as shopping for groceries at our local market, eating out at \\na restaurant or ordering take-away food, visiting a place of worship, attending a musical performance or \\nwatching a sporting match Œ are likely to have been in˜uenced or enriched (or, in some cases, made possible) \\nby migrants who have brought with them customs and traditions.\\nPerhaps one of the most signi˚cant and highly visible contributions of migrants to the sociocultural \\ndimensions of societies throughout the world has been the sharing of food and culinary traditions, resulting \\nin the tremendous increase in food diversity in modern times. The highly social aspect of sharing food is \\na distinctly human trait of considerable cultural importance, and it has provided an opportunity for social \\nbonding in private and public settings.\\n18 The power of sharing and valuing such intimate and historical \\ncultural conditions as the preparation of food allows for migrants™ contributions to be understood as more \\nprofound than the super˚cial so-called ﬁsushiologyﬂ of migration.\\n19 Food can lie at the heart of integration \\nexperiences, which are often depicted as two-way processes:\\nImmigrants travel with their culinary practices and habits, while acquiring new food customs \\nthat they adapt naturally to their new life and, occasionally, import to their countries of origin. \\nThis mixing takes place, therefore, in both directions, as a re˚ection of human beings™ need to share and dialogue, expressed through food.20Food also acts as a catalyst for cultural fusion and new experience, as many of the world™s so-called ﬁglobal \\ncitiesﬂ can show.\\n21 Recent research shows that, globally, we are now more connected in culinary terms than ever \\nbefore. A study of crop origins has found that the most important primary regions of diversity contributing to \\na country™s modern food system are more often located elsewhere around the planet.\\n22 Immigration, mobility \\nand trade links have helped facilitate the development of the modern food system. Cuisines such as ﬁIndian \\ncurryﬂ or the ﬁchicken tikka masalaﬂ (which rose to the status of being called Britain™s national dish) have \\nbeen a widely acknowledged aspect of the IndianŒPakistaniŒBangladeshi diaspora™s contribution to bringing \\ndiverse people together both ﬁon the tableﬂ and ﬁinside the kitchenﬂ.\\n23Food culture can also be enriched by migrants returning home. In Belize, for example, its diversity and \\nemigration patterns have allowed for the development of a rich food culture that draws on a variety of \\n\\n19\\n20\\n\\n21\\n22\\n\\n23\\n\\n166cuisines and ingredients that are brought home to the country by migrant workers.\\n24 There are many countries \\nthroughout the world that can claim their cuisines have been enriched by international migration and the \\ntransfer of related cultural practices, especially those situated along sea and land trade routes or part of \\nlong-term migration corridors, such as Malta and Singapore. Recent studies have found a strong relationship \\nbetween diversity of modern cuisines and migration.\\n25In recent years, the arenas of professional and representational sport at the international level have become \\nimportant in anti-racism and counter-xenophobia campaigns. The highly competitive and elite nature of this \\nsector, as well as its high pro˚le, has meant that migrants are often centre-stage for predominantly positive \\nreasons.\\n26 In many ways, elite sports allow migrants to ﬁtranscendﬂ discrimination and other negative issues \\nbecause of the extraordinary talent they display and the admiration they may invoke. Programmes such as \\nthe European Sport Inclusion Network, the Social Inclusion and Volunteering in Sports Clubs in Europe, and \\nﬁWelcome Footballﬂ (Australia) have sought to acknowledge and utilize migrant sports stars as positive role \\nmodels, including to encourage integration through sports activities.\\n27 And yet, research has pointed to issues \\nof inequality in the international sphere of elite sports, whereby migrants from countries of considerable, \\nlong-standing talent at the representative level have not necessarily been able to support vibrant sporting \\nsystems. Or, put another way, ﬁduring the 2002 soccer World Cup, 21 out of 23 players on the team from \\nSenegal– played in the French league– real Senegalese football is not therefore played within Senegal, \\nbut in the clubs of Europeﬂ.\\n28 At the local level in Australia, Sudanese migrants have established basketball \\nteams at local sports clubs as a way of encouraging teenagers from the community Œ African-Australian and \\nothers Œ to leave street culture behind.\\n29 Australia is a sporting country, and the discourse on sports and \\nmigration has been reasonably strong, with policy and programming including sporting activities as a means \\nof integration. However, recent research has found that migrants™ cultural contributions can be both an asset \\nto, and a source of exclusion from, sport participation.\\n30 This depends, in part, on the majorityŒminority \\naspects of the sports activity and the extent to which the speci˚c cultural capital of migrants can be ˜exibly \\nincorporated into sporting systems.\\n31 Nevertheless, there is no doubt that, overall, migrants have made \\nsigni˚cant positive contributions in sports at local, national and global levels. See, for example, the text box \\nbelow on the ﬁSalah effectﬂ.\\n24\\n25\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n30\\n\\n31\\n167The Salah effect\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n168Just as extraordinary sporting talent has been found to enable individuals to transcend aspects of racism, \\nmigrants possessing exceptional artistic ability have been able to gain popularity and achieve success, \\nthereby providing diverse role models for others in their communities. This is not to say that discrimination \\nis overcome, but that social norms are able to be shaped over time in positive and constructive ways through \\nadmiration and respect (as highlighted in the text box above). In popular culture, difference is an asset, \\nproviding an ﬁedgeﬂ in highly competitive talent and consumer-driven markets, making migrants from diverse \\nbackgrounds often overrepresented in entertainment sectors.\\n32 In the creation of pop music, migrants can \\ncontribute fresh ideas:\\nArtistic production is an endeavour in which innovation is highly prized. This may give migrants and their ambivalently native born yet not-quite-native children some ironic advantages... Bringing different frames, tastes and repertoires from their cultures of origin may give migrants something new to add to the creative mix.33Cultural traditions can also be shared experiences as well as form the basis of resilience and strength in \\nforeign (sometimes hostile) environments. A recent line of analysis has focused on ﬁsuper-diversityﬂ and the \\nbene˚ts as well as challenges highly diverse communities can present as a result of international migration, \\nincluding in relation to cultural fusion and social cohesion, but also social tensions and xenophobia.\\n34 The \\nnotion of ﬁsuper-diversityﬂ often relates to cities as the main site of increasingly diverse populations\\n35 and, \\nrelatedly, of diversity of sociocultural settings and experiences.\\nMigrants have also made signi˚cant sociocultural contributions to countries of origin. It has long been \\nobserved that migrants bring with them new ideas, values and practices, sometimes referred to as ﬁsocial \\nremittancesﬂ.\\n36 These types of remittances are transferred or exchanged in various ways, including ﬁwhen \\nmigrants return to live in or visit their communities of origin, when non-migrants visit those in the receiving \\ncountry, or through the exchange of letters, videos, cassettes, emails, blog posts and telephone callsﬂ.\\n37 Importantly, not all social remittances are positive. The ideas and practices that migrants bring with them \\ncan have both positive and negative effects.\\n38 For example, migrants have helped to shape gender norms \\nin countries of origin by supporting and arguing for greater gender equity after experiencing it in other \\ncountries. Returning migrants have been found to have contributed positively to the empowerment of women \\nand girls in their home countries.\\n39 One recent migration study found migrants in countries with gender \\nparity are likely to promote gender equality in the social institutions in countries of origin, with women \\nbeing greater agents of change than men.\\n40 However, those who migrated to countries with lower ratings of \\ngender equality tend to bring back more conservative gender norms.\\n41 A similar trend has been observed in \\nrelation to fertility rates. A 2013 study examining the relationship between international migration and the \\nfertility rates of countries of origin at the macroeconomic level found that migration to countries with lower \\n32\\n\\n33\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n35\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n40\\n\\n41\\n169fertility rates is associated with a reduction in fertility rates at home, while migration to destinations with \\nhigh fertility rates tends to result in the reverse.\\n42 Migrants™ contributions in civicŒpolitical termsMigrants can be important contributors to civicŒpolitical life. In destination countries, for example, migrants \\ncan be involved in governance and politics at different levels (such as community/local areas, national \\nlevels), undertake volunteer work, and support fellow migrants (especially those who are newly arrived) \\nas they integrate into new communities. Chapter 6 of this report discusses aspects of these issues from an \\nintegration and social cohesion perspective, including the extent to which migrants are able to wholly engage \\nin political processes (such as democratic elections). \\nPerhaps more than sociocultural and economic contributions, the extent to which migrants are able to make \\ncivicŒpolitical contributions depends on policy settings of the country, including at the national, subnational \\nand local levels; this topic is discussed in chapter 6 of this report and is not repeated here. However, the key \\nfactors in˜uencing migrants™ contributions have been neatly summarized in a publication on migrants™ civicŒ\\npolitical contributions (see table 1). This summary table shows the complexity of factors affecting the extent \\nto which migrants are able to contribute in the civicŒpolitical sphere, which include structural settings but \\nextend to other factors, including cultural and demographic aspects.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\nŁ \\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\nSource:\\n \\n\\n\\n42\\n\\n170As can be seen from table 1, normative or policy settings at all three governance levels (global, national \\nand local) are important in circumscribing migrants™ civicŒpolitical contributions. For example, the right to \\nvote, hold public of˚ce, or join a political party or a trade union may be set by (or rely upon) regulations \\nat different levels, determining the extent and nature of related engagement. In some places, for example, \\nmigrants are able (and expected) to contribute actively, including through voting in democratic elections \\n(e.g. New Zealand), although this is still relatively uncommon for national elections. (See the text box on \\nﬁCountries where migrants can vote in national electionsﬂ in chapter 6 of this report.) The ability to vote \\nin democratic elections is often linked to naturalization, so that migrants who become citizens are able to \\nvote as well as stand for public of˚ce. In the United States, for example, the November 2018 elections for \\nthe 116th Congress delivered the most racially and ethnically diverse Congress in the country™s history, and \\n13 per cent of its members are ˚rst- or second-generation migrants.\\n43 In other locations, such as Gulf States, \\nmigrant workers make up very signi˚cant proportions of workforces and yet are banned from contributing to \\nthe protection of workers™ rights through collective/trade unionism, let alone able to naturalize (see chapter \\n6 of this report).\\n44The role of diaspora has received signi˚cant attention in research and policy communities, and the extent to \\nwhich diaspora groups are able to engage in the political processes of origin countries varies widely, and can \\nbe contested and sensitive.\\n45 Recent Turkish elections (Parliamentary, and a referendum on the Constitution), \\nfor example, showed a high rate of participation by the Turkish diaspora and were also the subject of \\ncontroversy, namely the extent of election campaigning by political parties targeting Turks living in Europe.\\n46  There are also some speci˚c limitations on diaspora engagement that are set at the international level, such \\nas limits on the most extreme forms of political insurgency conducted by banned organizations operating \\ntransnationally.\\n47 Experiences in destination countries can also shape the political ideals of migrants as \\nthey witness different systems in action and become integrated into host societies. Migrants can bring back \\npolitical ideologies to origin countries when they return, temporarily or permanently. Research has found \\nthat returning Filipino migrants from Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, for example, showed \\na higher commitment to democracy, while returnees from Saudi Arabia expressed more ambivalence towards \\nit.48 Migrants, including refugees, can also be important agents of change in peacebuilding and reconstruction \\nprocesses, bringing their experiences, skills and resources to the rebuilding of infrastructure, social cohesion \\nand political processes in post-con˜ict settings, as shown in the text box below.\\n4943\\n\\n\\n44\\n\\n45\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n171Diaspora building peace\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n172\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe economic contributions of migrantsIn terms of economic contributions, there is a very substantial and growing body of evidence on the centrality \\nof migrants™ remittances to support families and local communities in origin countries.\\n50 International \\nremittances Œ in contrast to overseas development assistance and, to a lesser extent, direct foreign \\ninvestment\\n Œ are localized contributions made through personal transactions, typically helping families to \\nmeet basic household needs (such as food and shelter) and alleviate poverty.\\n51 The money that migrants \\nsend home can be important buffers against unexpected costs, supporting household ˚nancial stability and \\nresilience.\\n52 Money can also support access to health services and investment in education of immediate and \\nextended family members, as well as provide the ability to invest in businesses, property and other assets.\\n53 The introduction and expansion of ﬁmobile moneyﬂ apps over the last decade has allowed for migrants™ \\ncontributions in the form of remittances to better support their families and friends. An example from Kenya \\nillustrates:\\nAs of 2013, 93 per cent of the adult population in Kenya is registered for M-Pesa, and 60 per cent actively use the service. The impact of the M-Pesa is much broader as it has \\nfacilitated the creation of thousands of small businesses and gave nearly 20 million Kenyans access to ˜nancial services, particularly low-income Kenyans. The percentage of people \\nliving on less than $1.25 a day using M-Pesa grew from less than 20 per cent in 2008 to 72 per cent in three years.54In addition to enhanced ˚nancial inclusion, ﬁmobile moneyﬂ also provides lower money transfer costs and \\nreduces the risk of exploitative practices. There is, however, recognition that both access rates and usage differ \\nsocioeconomically and demographically within local communities. Recent research in Ghana, for example, has \\nfound that women display different ˚nancial behaviours and are more likely to save in household settings \\nusing mobile money, and yet have more limited access to information and communication technology (ICT). \\n50\\n\\n\\n\\n51\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\n53\\n54\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n173The researchers subsequently recommended that ﬁefforts should be geared towards the provision of mobile \\nphones (and other ICTs) to women to help them to be ˚nancially included to achieve developmentﬂ.\\n55 A similar \\nstudy in Uganda found that poor households would bene˚t from tailored programmes and additional assistance \\nto support greater access to mobile money services.\\n56 In some countries, various laws and regulations have \\nlimited ICTs for cross-border ˚nancial ˜ows. While it is important to ensure digital security and prevent \\nillicit ˚nancial transfers, overly cumbersome and rigid regulations have often driven up the cost of sending \\nremittances, for example, and slowed the uptake of new technologies needed to enhance ˚nancial inclusion.\\n57Legal status can have a profound effect on the ability to contribute economically to families and communities \\nback home. Irregularity and precariousness are linked to more limited options to remit, and higher costs in \\ndoing so. Irregularity in destination also often translates into lower wages with greater risk of exploitation, \\nhigher relative living costs and reduced choice, which can in turn translate into a lower capacity to remit.\\n58 In addition, studies have found that greater precariousness associated with working as an irregular migrant \\nin informal settings results in workers ensuring they have enough money to deal with uncertainties, which \\nagain negatively affects their ability to remit.\\n59 This is in the context of recognition that irregular migrants \\nŒ even more so than other migrants Œ will be key contributors to societies of the type of labour least favoured \\nby the native-born: the so-called 3D (dirty, dangerous, demanding) jobs.\\n60 The ﬁwinnersﬂ in all this, some \\nargue, are the receiving countries, who are able to bene˚t from a steady supply of workers in the informal \\neconomy and so keep wage costs down,\\n61 while also not bene˚ting from income tax revenues. This is not \\nuniform, however, and certain sectors in many economies (such as the agricultural, ˚shery and care sectors) \\nrely more heavily on irregular migrant workers, resulting in labour market segmentation. Employers in these \\nsectors may operate as ﬁbad actorsﬂ by exploiting irregular migrant workers, who are more likely to accept \\nlower pay and bad working conditions out of desperation.\\n62 As one means of addressing these issues, some \\ncountries implement regularization programmes periodically so that those who are in irregular situations \\ncan gain lawful status and (re)enter the formal economy.\\n63 However, more systematic responses focusing on \\ndecent work for native-born and migrants alike will ensure people performing low-/semi-skilled work are able \\nto improve their ability to contribute.\\n55\\n\\n56\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n59\\n\\n60\\n\\n61\\n62\\n63\\n\\n174More than a worker–\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMigrants have made and continue to make signi˚cant economic contributions, in both countries of origin \\nand destination. Migrants™ monetary remittances to their countries of origin are among the most widely \\nresearched and scrutinized economic contributions. As the amount of money sent in the form of remittances \\nhas sharply increased over the years, so has the interest from policymakers and academics in understanding \\nhow remittances contribute, both positively and negatively, to recipient countries. In 2018, global remittances \\namounted to USD 689 billion, whereas ˜ows to low- and middle-income countries alone rose to a record \\nUSD 529 billion, up from USD 483 billion in 2017.\\n64 The signi˚cance of remittances to countries of origin \\ncannot be overstated; remittances to low- and middle-income countries, except for China, exceeded foreign \\ndirect investment (FDI) ˜ows in 2018,\\n65 a re˜ection of increased international migration, as well as new \\nand relatively lower cost channels for international money transfers.\\n66 More information on remittances is \\nprovided in chapters 2 (global overview) and 3 (regional developments) of this report.\\nWhile migrants™ other aggregate contributions to countries of origin are not as well documented as remittances, \\na growing body of evidence is providing a sharper focus on these bene˚ts. One such contribution is ˚nancing \\n64\\n\\n65\\n66\\n\\n175through instruments such as diaspora bonds. For struggling and cash-strapped countries, diaspora bonds \\nare a relatively inexpensive way to raise funds, including during periods of ˚nancial stress\\n67 and after \\ndisasters; they have been a key alternative to borrowing funds from more expensive lenders such as other \\ngovernments, ˚nancial institutions or capital markets. Borrowing at an attractive rate from their citizens \\nabroad, governments have also been able to pursue large development projects. Meanwhile, diaspora bonds \\nhave provided citizens and former citizens abroad with the opportunity to be development actors back home \\nŒ to tangibly contribute to their origin countries™ economies, particularly as disaster management initiatives \\nafter calamities such as earthquakes and ˜oods have struck their ﬁhomelandsﬂ. In 2017, for example, Nigeria \\nissued its ˚rst diaspora bond, raising USD 300 million to fund infrastructure projects.\\n68 Armenia, a country \\nwith a large diaspora, also established government-issued diaspora bonds in 2018.\\n69 But India and Israel are \\nperhaps the most successful examples of countries that have reaped bene˚ts from diaspora bonds, with both \\ncountries raising billions of dollars over the decades.\\n70 India has also been offering differential and tax-free \\ninterest rates on ˚xed deposits in Indian banks made by non-resident Indians.\\n71 Since 1951, Israel has raised \\nmore than USD\\n 40 billion through this ˚nancing mechanism.\\n72In addition to diaspora bonds, migrants have contributed to their home countries™ economies by directly \\ninvesting in or starting new businesses. Several studies have demonstrated that returned migrants are more \\nlikely to start businesses than are people who never left their countries.\\n73 Indeed, in some countries, diaspora-\\nowned companies make up a signi˚cant share of FDI. In Georgia, for example, an estimated 17\\n per cent of \\nprivate sector ˚rms belong to the country™s diaspora.\\n74 Diaspora entrepreneurship has not only helped to \\nbuild physical capital in countries of origin, but also continues to enhance economic productivity as well \\nas contribute to job creation. But the economic contributions migrants make to countries of origin extend \\nbeyond ˚nancing and entrepreneurship; by establishing migration networks across countries, migrants have \\nreduced information barriers and have helped to boost trade and investment ˜ows between countries of origin \\nand destination.\\n75 A recent study, exploring if the presence of migrants has an impact on FDI investment \\ndecisions, found that immigration does indeed reduce information asymmetries and positively affects \\noutgoing FDI stocks from destination to countries of origin.\\n76 The presence of a large number of migrants \\ncan also establish a market for products manufactured in their countries of origin and thus enhance trade \\n˜ows between economies.\\n77 Offshore business process outsourcing and back-of˚ce operations are signi˚cant \\nventures in India, started by returnees by raising venture capital at times of economic downturns in the \\ndeveloped countries, particularly the United States, that drove them back home in the ˚rst place.\\n78 Among \\nthe most important contributions that migrants make to their countries of origin is their in˜uence on human \\ncapital stocks. This is done either directly when they return with new knowledge and skills, or indirectly \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n69\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n176by incentivizing citizens to acquire or enhance their human capital, bolstering a country™s overall skills.\\n79 Innovative engagement of expatriate doctors and nurses in a perceived ﬁUnited Nations Healthkeeping Forceﬂ \\n(emulating the United Nations Peacekeeping Force) to provide free or low-cost medical care to unskilled and \\nirregular immigrants among their own diaspora, as well as in low-Human Development Index third countries, \\nhas been suggested.\\n80 However, a recurring concern among policymakers is that emigration, particularly of \\nhigh-skilled migrants, can come at a cost. ﬁBrain drainﬂ and ﬁbrain wasteﬂ, or the loss/under-utilization of \\nhigh-skilled human capital, are commonly raised and widely debated issues.\\n81The economic contributions of migrants in destination countries have been examined in depth over time. A \\nlarge body of evidence exists on how both low- and high-skilled migrants have recti˚ed labour shortages, which \\nmay relate to particular occupation groups, sectors or speci˚c professions.\\n82 In countries with large shares of \\nhigh-skilled natives, low-skilled migrant workers have complemented the skills of natives by occupying jobs in \\nsectors where citizens are in short supply; in many cases, these are also sectors that native workers consider \\nunattractive.\\n83 This not only addresses labour gaps in industries such as construction and agriculture,\\n84 but also \\nallows native workers in high-skilled sectors to further specialize in their work. This complementarity of skills \\nhas been signi˚cant for native, high-skilled women. As migrants have ˚lled jobs in childcare and housekeeping, \\nfemale native workers have been able to increase their workplace participation and productivity. For example, \\na study conducted in Italy found that, when there was a large supply of immigrants who provided household \\nservices, native Italian women spent more time at work.\\n85 A 2011 study in the United States drew the same \\nconclusion, suggesting that by lowering the costs of household services, low-skilled immigration increases the \\nlabour supply and average hours of market work of high-skilled native women.\\n86Some countries are almost entirely dependent on migrant workers, especially in industries such as \\nconstruction, hospitality and retail. In the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, for example, international \\nmigrants make up signi˚cant proportions of their national populations (88% and 76%, respectively).\\n87 And \\nfor countries undergoing population decline, migrants can be essential in offsetting some of the negative \\neconomic consequences associated with a shrinking population, which can stymie a country™s overall \\neconomic productivity and growth. As fertility rates tumble across regions such as Europe, migrants remain \\nsigni˚cant contributors to population growth and labour supply.\\n88 In the European Union, natural population \\nchange (births and deaths) only contributed 20\\n per cent to population growth from 2012 to 2016, while net \\nmigration added 80\\n per cent to total population increase.\\n89In terms of their broader economic contributions with large-scale and long-term externalities to societies, \\nmigrants have long been drivers of entrepreneurship and innovation. Migrants, unlike people who have never \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n177lived outside of their home countries, are much more willing to take business risks. This, as some researchers \\nhave observed, may be because migrants have already taken the risk of leaving their countries of origin to \\npursue opportunities in new places and are thus well-primed to be risk takers.\\n90 By overcoming obstacles \\nand the challenges that come with moving to a new country, they develop the so-called ﬁgrowth mindsetﬂ, \\nwhich allows them to be adaptable, more con˚dent and to have a higher tolerance for uncertainty.\\n91 Recent \\nstudies, however, have cautioned against seeing migrants as ﬁsuper-entrepreneursﬂ compared with natives \\nwhen aggregate data are patchy at best.\\n92 Additionally, migrant entrepreneurs continue to face signi˚cant \\nchallenges, which can result in the collapse of their enterprises. The failure to access credit is among the \\nmost important constraints on migrant entrepreneurship, and while this is not unique to migrants, they have \\ngreater dif˚culty acquiring business loans than those who are native born.\\n93 Factors such as lack of collateral, \\nshorter credit histories, possible discrimination and credit institutions™ unfamiliarity with migrants all make \\nthem less likely to receive credit from lending institutions.\\n94 Other obstacles Œ including limited rights to \\nstart a business, lack of local networks, unfamiliarity with the local business environment and language and \\ncultural barriers Œ remain signi˚cant constraints on migrant entrepreneurship.\\n95Perhaps more than in any other developed country, immigrants have signi˚cantly contributed to driving \\ninnovation and entrepreneurship in the United States. While immigrants represented only 13\\n per cent of \\nthe population in a country of more than 300 million people, they comprised nearly 30\\n per cent of all \\nentrepreneurs.\\n96 In addition to their disproportionate contribution toward entrepreneurship, recent research \\nsuggests that businesses founded by immigrants in the United States were not only more likely to survive, \\nbut also tended to outperform those started by native citizens when it came to employment growth over \\nthree- and six-year periods.\\n97 However, the same study did ˚nd that, in terms of growth in wages, immigrant-\\nfounded companies did not perform any better than those started by natives and may in fact underperform \\ntheir native peers.\\n98 The success and contribution to innovation is most visible in the engineering and \\ntechnology industries; in about one quarter of engineering and technology ˚rms founded in the United States \\nfrom 2006 to 2012, for example, at least one main founder was an immigrant.\\n99 Silicon Valley is often cited as \\nthe hub of such successful migrant innovators and entrepreneurs.\\n100 Yet this trend is not limited to the United \\nStates. Globally, migrants continue to help create jobs as well as contribute to destination countries™ economic \\ngrowth through entrepreneurship. A 2012 survey of 69 economies by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor \\ndemonstrated that immigrants had higher entrepreneurial activity compared with natives.\\n101 Moreover, while \\nthere is a dearth of research on the contributions of migrants to entrepreneurship in low-income countries, \\nemerging studies, particularly those focused on refugees, show that where they are given the opportunity to \\nwork, refugees make positive contributions to destination economies. In Uganda, a country that hosts one \\n90\\n\\n91\\n92\\n\\n\\n93\\n\\n94\\n95\\n96\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n99\\n\\n\\n100\\n\\n101\\n\\n\\n178of the largest refugee populations in the world, refugees Œ those residing in both cities and in rural areas Œ \\nare highly entrepreneurial and have created jobs not just for themselves but also for Ugandan nationals.\\n102 Research conducted on refugee entrepreneurs in Kampala, showed that refugees employ 2.4 people on average \\nin the city.\\n103 A similar trend has been observed in South Africa, whose self-settlement approach to refugees \\nallows them not only to move freely, but also to ˚nd work and to be self-employed. However, because many \\nrefugees struggle to ˚nd employment in the formal economy, many choose to start their own enterprises in \\nthe informal sector. A recent report on ﬁrefugee entrepreneurial economies in urban South Africaﬂ found that \\nrefugee enterprises have contributed to the country™s economy by creating jobs;\\n104 an estimated 52\\n per cent \\nand 45\\n per cent of businesses in the provinces of Cape Town and Limpopo, respectively, employ people in their \\nenterprises, with around 50\\n per cent of these businesses more likely to employ South Africans.\\n105Migrants as innovators\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni 102\\n\\n103\\n104\\n\\n105\\n179\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew impediments to the recognition of migrants™ contributionsIn previous sections, we have seen that there have always existed obstacles, major and minor, to migrants \\nbeing able to contribute in origin and destination settings, typically related to policy settings stemming \\nfrom a range of legal contexts. Many obstacles, for example, are based on the application of laws regulating \\nsocieties more broadly, such as those related to labour law, property law, criminal law, tax law and such. \\nLikewise, we have seen that changes in structural/policy settings and new technology (such as mobile money) \\nhave been successfully adopted to facilitate migrants™ contributions in speci˚c ways. The issue of maximizing \\nor optimizing contributions and creating the right conditions for opportunities to be realized in the pursuit \\nof peace and prosperity is, of course, not speci˚c to migrants, but remains at the heart of policymaking in \\nmost countries throughout the world as it relates to all residents (citizen and non-citizens). However, the \\nrelationships between policymaking and politics have also evolved, bringing them much closer together \\nover time for a range of reasons, including the 24/7 media cycle, the shift from ﬁexpertise and analysisﬂ to \\nﬁopinionﬂ, the very signi˚cant changes in expediency and delivery at the expense of critical re˜ection and \\nadjustment, among others.\\n106Combined with seismic geopolitical events Œ such as the end of the Cold War, the 9/11 attacks, the 2015/16 \\nlarge-scale movements of people to and through Europe Œ more recent policy environments have had to \\nincreasingly accommodate a more brutal form of politics and respond to the pressing issue of migration. \\nThis is most apparent in Western democratic countries, but is by no means limited to them. In a 2014 big \\ndata study on media depictions of migration and migrants in 10 countries,\\n107 one of the key ˚ndings was \\nthat politicians were by far the most dominant voices in the media in all countries. This was the case in \\nAfghanistan, just as it was in Sri Lanka, Canada and the United Kingdom.\\n108 Immigration is increasingly \\nbeing used as a political reference point, and as a way of de˚ning values (and in democratic systems, as a \\nmeans of appealing to the electorate). Some studies have found that ﬁpolitical con˜ict over immigration \\nfollows a political logic and must be attributed to parties and party competition rather than to ‚objective \\n106\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n180pressures™ﬂ.\\n109 The role of far-right parties in politicizing immigration for political expediency is a recurring \\ntheme in recent studies.\\n110 In other words, in many countries ﬁanti-immigrationﬂ rhetoric has become a \\ncentral plank of political branding in the quest for market share, regardless of the signi˚cance (or otherwise) \\nof the substantive issue itself. What was once ﬁdog-whistlingﬂ on anti-immigration has become a central \\ntheme in political messaging. Politics itself is becoming a signi˚cant impediment to balanced policy on \\nimmigration and the contributions of migrants.\\nPolitics and migration\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n109\\n\\n\\n110\\n\\n181We must also recognize that the fundamental ways in which public debates occur has changed. By this we \\nmean that the ﬁwho, what, where and howﬂ of public discourse are manifestly different in a world that has \\nrecently experienced a rapid transformation in transnational connectivity. The ability to access information \\nand opinion from different locations globally has massively expanded. We are also able to (self) publish our \\nown views largely without restraint, a development made possible by relatively new social media platforms. \\nBy using these platforms, organized groups, regardless of their numeric size, are increasingly able to utilize \\nopen, real-time (un-curated) publishing to distort narratives in attempts to realize changes in political (and \\npolicy) decisions.\\n111 Overall, the way we Œ as countries, as communities, and increasingly as transnational \\nvalue-based groups Œ describe and discuss migration to ourselves and to others is being shaped by the massive \\nchanges in the media landscape. Recent research on these changes has been undertaken utilizing big data \\nanalysis on Twitter, for example, ˚nding that some groups are engaging in ﬁentanglementﬂ of messaging in \\norder to portray refugees and other migrants as negative, regardless of the facts (see text box below). \\nTransnational tribalism, immigration and social media platforms \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne 111\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n182\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConcluding observations on the challenge ahead \\nIn an ideal world, there would be no need for this chapter to be written. The topic itself would be so obvious \\nand uncontroversial as to render it irrelevant. And yet, it is more important now than at any other time in \\nmodern, post-war history to re˜ect on migrants™ contributions to countries and communities around the \\nworld. Simply put, this is because it is becoming increasingly dif˚cult to hear balanced perspectives in public \\ndebates on important policy issues, such as international migration. \\nGiven this context, this chapter is not about quantitative costŒbene˚t analyses of migration. Instead, \\nthe chapter has looked at the often neglected but core determinant of the migrant(s) as contributors to \\ncommunities of destination as well as those back in their places of origin.\\nWith this perspective, we have focused on three central domains of what makes a good society: sociocultural, \\ncivicŒpolitical and economic contributions. Today in the twenty-˚rst century, migrants may be better able \\nto make contributions to these domains than they were in the last century (or prior) largely because of \\nthe phenomenal improvements in development that have taken place in most countries, as well as strong \\nrecognition of the need to ensure that global development and stability are underpinned by human rights.\\n112 Yet, this chapter also drives home the point that the contributions of migrants to societies, polities and \\nthe economies globally have not only been largely overlooked, downplayed and taken for granted, but \\nalso hindered, through proliferation of disruption and disinformation against migrants. Recent research and \\nanalysis show that some forms of technology are impacting our media, social and political interactions, and \\nare becoming more pressing for governance, both in relation to the regulation of newer forms of technology \\nand how they are shaping democratic processes.\\n113The question therefore remains as to what would be a balanced strategy to make the contributions optimally, \\nif not maximally, visible, acknowledged and accepted on the global and national policy agendas. \\nWhile some activists and advocates argue for adopting political responses,\\n114 and others engage in countering \\nnegative images only by putting forward positive ﬁidealizedﬂ representations of migrants, others argue that we \\nneed to be cautious, as these approaches risk further polarization in public discussions that are increasingly \\nin˜uenced by in˜ammatory (and sometimes inaccurate) social media commentary.\\n115 With this context in \\nmind, the following implications for policy, practice and research are offered:\\n112\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n113\\n114\\n\\n\\n\\n115\\n\\n183Ł Balanced public discussions require greater scrutiny of ﬁfakeﬂ social media content, including by \\npromoting a better understanding of the responsibilities that go hand-in-hand with free speech. This \\nis currently a ﬁhotﬂ issue in many parts of the world, with stricter regulatory regimes being actively \\nconsidered, or having been put in place.\\n116Ł There is clearly a place for greater emphasis on migrant-centric research and analyses, as well as research \\non the social media activists™ in˜uence on bolstering unbalanced political discourse (and ultimately \\npolitical decisions). Ideally, this research would examine the impacts of a wide range of distorted \\nmessaging, noting that existing studies outlined in this chapter indicate that the negative, anti-migrant \\ninterest groups appear to be increasingly using social media platforms to great effect, at times regardless \\nof accuracy or truthful representations.\\nŁ Both historically and contemporarily, there is strong evidence that migrants have made substantial \\ncontributions in a variety of settings and in a variety of important ways. However, it is also clear \\nthat there are structural limits that act to circumscribe migrants™ contributions in ways that are \\ncounterproductive for communities, States and migrants. The most obvious examples exist with respect \\nto irregular or undocumented migrants who may be doing low-prestige, underpaid work that is, in many \\ncases, nevertheless much needed. Structural reforms combined with migration policy initiatives (such as \\nregularization and enhanced regular pathways) offer the opportunity to optimize migrants™ contributions \\nand support sectors and communities.\\n117Ł There is room to build on innovations delivered by new technology Œ such as mobile money apps Œ to \\nhelp facilitate migrants™ contributions in origin and destination settings. Migrant tech has the ability \\nto support migrants all the way through the migration cycle, including as a means of supporting safe, \\nregular and orderly migration. Further support of migrant tech start-ups is one practical approach, \\nnoting the work already underway in this area.\\n118Ł There is considerable room to improve recognition of the enormous value of sociocultural and civicŒpolitical \\ncontributions of migrants in societies and globally, including in political, media and research spheres. \\nWhile this can be challenging, the tendency to focus on economic issues without fully acknowledging \\nthe importance of other aspects leads to a transactional view of societies and nation States. Expanding \\nresearch, for example, on the in˜uence migrants can have as positive leaders (for example, the ﬁSalah \\neffectﬂ), as well as on the relationship between culinary knowledge transfer and health and well-being, \\nwould enable policymakers and general audiences to better appreciate the important contributions \\nmigrants have already made to modern life globally, as well as what further contributions they will offer.\\n116\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n185MIGRATION, INCLUSION AND SOCIAL COHESION: \\nCHALLENGES, RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND \\nOPPORTUNITIES1 Introduction \\nThe relationship between migrants and the communities in which they reside forms an integral and important \\npart of the migration cycle.\\n2 This relationship takes the form of psychological and sociological processes \\nof adaptation between migrants and receiving communities, which affect the degree of inclusion migrants \\nwill experience, including their sense of belonging. Settling in a new community Œ either temporarily or \\npermanently Œ may require migrants to adapt to a new culture, customs, social values and language. The \\nextent to which migrants will in turn be progressively included in their destination country also depends on \\nthe attitudes of receiving communities, including their openness to migration and migrants.\\nMigrants™ inclusion has always been an important part of the migration phenomenon; however, it is today \\na particularly complex issue. In an increasingly globalized world, the growth in the absolute number of \\nmigrants over the past 50 years and the diversi˚cation of migrants™ origins, socioeconomic backgrounds and \\nreasons for migrating have led to more social, cultural, ethnic and religious diversity in receiving societies.\\n3 As a result, the impact of migration and diversity on social cohesion has become an important concern.\\n4 This \\nis illustrated by inclusion policies adopted by some States to frame the relationship between migrants and \\nreceiving communities and preserve social cohesion. These inclusion policies have taken multiple forms over \\ntime in different countries, re˜ecting societal values, including attitudes on immigration and diversity. \\nWhile the question of how to live together in increasingly diverse communities has become central, the \\nchallenges in addressing migrants™ inclusion have been compounded by the many opinions and voices on the \\ntopic. Alongside migrants and States, a wide array of actors Œ such as civil society organizations, communities \\nand local authorities Œ now play increasingly important roles in migrants™ inclusion. In addition, virtually \\neveryone today has the ability to express publicly their opinions on immigration and migrants™ inclusion.\\n5 The politicization of migration for electioneering purposes has elevated the issues to become a matter of \\npublic concern. Due in part to negative portrayals made by political parties and reported by the media,\\n6 migrants have in some countries been presented as a challenge to national identity, values, economic stability \\nand security, as well as, more broadly, a threat to social cohesion.\\n7 Despite migrants™ important social and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6Chapter 6 Œ \\n186economic contributions (see chapter 5 of this report), anti-immigration sentiment has resulted in instances \\nof intolerance, discrimination, racism, xenophobia and even acts of violent extremism towards migrants, \\nespecially in countries where nationalism, patriotism and populism have been on the rise. \\nDespite these challenges, States have recently reaf˚rmed the centrality of migrants™ inclusion and social \\ncohesion by making them a stand-alone objective in the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular \\nMigration.\\n8 The Global Compact on Refugees likewise promotes the inclusion of refugees in the receiving \\ncountry through durable solutions, such as local integration.\\n9In order to better understand what migrants™ inclusion entails and the challenges and opportunities it may \\nbring, the remainder of this chapter is organized into three main parts. The ˚rst part introduces the notions \\nof inclusion and social cohesion, before turning, in the second part, to inclusion outcomes and obstacles. The \\nthird part then explores what ﬁthe situation on the groundﬂ is, most notably through the role played by local \\nactors and by migrants themselves. The conclusion discusses some implications for policy responses that may \\nhelp further foster migrants™ inclusion and social cohesion.\\nInclusion and social cohesion: Key concepts and definitions \\nDe˚ning ﬁmigrants™ inclusionﬂ and ﬁsocial cohesionﬂ is a dif˚cult task, as there are no universally recognized \\nde˚nitions. The ambiguity of these notions is exacerbated by the frequent use of various closely related terms, \\nand the dif˚culty in distinguishing them (see appendix A for an illustrative list and suggested de˚nitions of \\nthese concepts).\\n10In broad terms, social cohesion can be de˚ned through the notions of ﬁsolidarityﬂ, ﬁtogethernessﬂ, ﬁtoleranceﬂ \\nand ﬁharmonious co-existenceﬂ.\\n11 It is not necessarily related to migration and migrants, but is more generally \\nabout the bonds tying a community together through trust and common social norms. While these bonds can \\nbe undermined by disparities in wealth and income, poverty, or intercommunal, ethnic or racial tensions, \\nthe impact of migration, and especially of diversity, on social cohesion has been increasingly questioned.\\n12 However, empirical evidence has so far not been conclusive. If some studies suggest a negative impact of \\ndiversity in countries such as the United States of America, research in the United Kingdom and, more \\ngenerally, in Europe, ˚nds that income inequality and deprivation have a greater impact on social cohesion \\nthan does diversity.\\n13 While the impact of migration and diversity on social cohesion is not clear-cut, social cohesion and migrants™ \\ninclusion are closely related. Social cohesion cannot be achieved if part of the population, including migrants, \\nis excluded in a given neighbourhood, community, city and/or country.\\n14 As a result, and despite the lack of a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n187universal de˚nition, inclusion can be summarized as consisting of social cohesion and migrants™ incorporation \\nin the various societal areas, such as education, health, employment, housing, and civic and political \\ninvolvement.\\n15 Who is a migrant?

Being a child of immigrants, it means balancing two different cultures. Growing up I had a hard time accepting that I was part of these two different worlds that are so con˚icting.c\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgainst this background, inclusion entails a process of mutual adaptation between migrants and receiving \\ncommunities. The degree of migrants™ inclusion depends on the individual concerned and the context in \\nwhich adaptation takes place. Factors affecting migrants™ process of inclusion include their demographic and \\npersonal characteristics (such as age, gender, level of education and language ability), social networks, and \\nability to exercise agency.\\n16 Inclusion remains a highly personal and individualized experience, as it differs \\namong migrants and family members, and can be different for various ﬁgroupsﬂ of migrants, such as refugees, \\nhigh- or low-skilled migrant workers, victims of traf˚cking or migrants™ descendants.\\n17 Likewise, the context \\nin˜uences one™s degree of inclusion, in terms of both geographical location and timing. Each country, society \\nand community will necessarily approach inclusion differently, as it depends on their respective historical, \\n15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n188economic, sociocultural and political contexts. Their resulting attitudes towards migration and diversity can \\nchange over time, determining in turn the type of migration and inclusion policies States will adopt.\\n18As a psychosociological process, inclusion is inherent to the migration experience.\\n19 Although research \\nfocuses primarily on the ﬁGlobal Northﬂ, inclusion transcends any NorthŒSouth divide because it concerns all \\ncountries. The fact that some countries have not adopted inclusion policies, as seen mostly in the ﬁGlobal \\nSouthﬂ, does not necessarily imply that migrants™ inclusion Œ or exclusion Œ does not occur in practice. It \\nsimply means that the State has not set a nationwide strategy for migrants™ inclusion. This may be because \\ninclusion is not among the priorities of policymakers. For example, this is the case in West African countries, \\nwhere other socioeconomic challenges are more pressing or resources are insuf˚cient.\\n20 Nonetheless, as acknowledged in the Global Compact for Migration, inclusion policies can constitute important \\ntools for countries to support migrants™ inclusion and foster social cohesion.\\n21 By contrast, the absence of \\ninclusion policies may be costly, not only for migrants who may face discrimination and be marginalized, but \\nalso more broadly for social cohesion, with a heightened risk of tensions, riots and civil unrest.\\n22 As part of \\n(im)migration or stand-alone policies, migrants™ inclusion can take different forms to frame how it should \\ntake place in a particular country according to its own values. The most prevalent national policy models of \\ninclusion have been those of assimilation, multiculturalism and integration which, as summarized in table\\n 1, \\ncan be differentiated according to the expected degrees of adaptation by migrants and of accommodation by \\nthe society. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n21\\n\\n22\\n\\n189\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1966a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssimilation considers diversity as a risk for social cohesion and requires the highest degree of adaptation \\nby migrants and a low degree of accommodation by the receiving society. It consists of a one-way policy \\nwhere migrants must fully embrace the receiving society™s national identity and values, to the detriment of \\ntheir original ones.\\n24 By contrast, multiculturalism values diversity and expects a low degree of adaptation \\nby migrants Œ who can retain their cultural identities Œ and a high degree of accommodation by the receiving \\nsociety.\\n25While assimilation has been referred to as a ﬁmelting potﬂ, multiculturalism has often been associated with \\na ﬁsalad bowlﬂ: a melting pot contains ingredients that melt together and become indistinguishable, whereas \\na salad bowl is made of diverse ingredients which co-exist side by side harmoniously. While assimilation was \\nalready the rule in Latin American countries, such as Argentina, during the mass migration of Europeans \\nin the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth century,\\n26 these two models were particularly \\nprevalent in traditional immigration countries during the twentieth century. In broad terms, the focus was \\nplaced on assimilation from the 1920s to the 1960s, and shifted to multiculturalism in the 1970s due to the \\n23\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\n25\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n190inability of the assimilationist model to accommodate increasingly diverse societies.\\n27 Although it is still \\nfollowed by some States, including Canada,\\n28 some have disavowed multiculturalism since the mid-1990s \\nbecause it has been considered unable to counter migrants™ exclusion and perceived as a threat to national \\nidentity and values.\\n29 As a result, different models have been embraced to restore a balance between diversity and unity, claimed \\nby some to have been lost because of multiculturalism.\\n30 At the national level, the model predominantly \\nrelied on today is that of integration, which stands in between assimilation and multiculturalism. It expects \\nmedium degrees of adaptation by migrants and accommodation by the receiving society.\\n31 Although no \\ncommonly agreed de˚nition exists, it is generally accepted to be a two-way process of mutual adaptation \\nbetween migrants and the societies in which they live.\\n32 At the local level, an interculturalist approach to \\ninclusion has developed, which emphasizes the importance of contacts and bonds between individuals of \\ndifferent backgrounds, both migrants and nationals. It relies on the idea that diversity is an advantage and \\naims to create mutual understanding and a culture of diversity to combat discrimination and inequalities.\\n33 This policy narrative ˚nds its origins in Quebec in the 1980s in response to the Canadian multicultural policy, \\nand has since been taken up in an increasing number of cities and neighbourhoods, in countries such as \\nSpain or Italy.\\n34 Inclusion outcomes: Challenges and policy responsesMeasuring the level of migrants™ inclusion in receiving societies (so-called ﬁinclusion outcomesﬂ) is complex \\ngiven the various individual and contextual factors in˜uencing inclusion (see text box below). It is nevertheless \\nimportant to identify potential obstacles and design and/or re-evaluate policy responses to more effectively \\nsupport migrants™ inclusion. \\nMeasuring migrants™ level of inclusion through indicators \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n\\n30\\n31\\n\\n\\n\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n191Ł \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne  See \\nThis section explores migrants™ inclusion outcomes and challenges in some key policy areas of inclusion,  \\nnamely, language, education, labour market inclusion, family reuni˚cation, political participation and \\nnaturalization. The focus on these speci˚c policy areas is without prejudice to the importance of others, such \\nas health or housing. While health is subject to a speci˚c chapter in this report (see chapter 7), housing is \\nalso an important aspect of migrant inclusion because its affordability and quality in˜uence migrants™ well-\\nbeing and social inclusion.\\n35 If housing inclusion can be assessed on the basis of access to homeownership for \\nsome migrants,\\n36 for others, such as refugees, mere access to decent housing is already an issue, as illustrated \\nby the so-called migrant ﬁcrisisﬂ in Europe in 2015Œ2016, which has been considered by some as a ﬁhousing \\ncrisisﬂ.\\n3735\\n36\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n192As detailed in appendix B, all the policy areas examined in this section re˜ect human rights to which all \\nindividuals are entitled, including migrants, with the principle of non-discrimination constituting a central \\npillar of migrants™ inclusion. However, migrants™ inclusion outcomes in these different policy areas remain \\ndependent on their immigration status. While legal residence is a major ˚rst step towards inclusion, the type \\nof permit dictates additional rights and entitlements, such as access to work and study. As it will appear, and \\nsimilarly to human rights, all these policy areas are also interrelated, as each may impact on one another. \\nDespite the emphasis sometimes placed on labour market inclusion,\\n38 this re˜ects the need for holistic \\ninclusion policies, covering all dimensions of migrants™ inclusion. \\nLanguageLanguage is considered one of the most central aspects for migrants™ inclusion by both the receiving society \\nand migrants themselves. In Europe, for instance, 95\\n per cent of Europeans are of the opinion that a certain \\ncommand of the national language is important for migrants to integrate.\\n39 While language can facilitate \\ninclusion prior to departure, without or with insuf˚cient knowledge of the language upon arrival, migrants \\noften identify language barriers as one of the ˚rst challenges they face. For instance, after migrating from \\nCambodia to Thailand for a work opportunity, Sophal notes: ﬁThe ˚rst three months proved to be very dif˚cult \\ndue to the language barrier. I couldn™t communicate with people and I was not familiar with the food.ﬂ\\n40 In addition to facilitating social interactions, language is important for helping migrants navigate a new \\nenvironment, including access to health care, housing and other services. It also improves their access to \\neducation, increases their likelihood of being employed, and leads to better self-reported health outcomes.\\n41 With such a pivotal role for migrants™ inclusion, language often constitutes an important area of government \\npolicy. National or local authorities sometimes support language acquisition through language courses, which \\ncan be mandatory for migrants. These language courses are at times freely available to migrants together with \\ncivic/social orientation courses (for example, in Sweden and Canada).\\n42 In addition, language pro˚ciency can \\nbe a requirement for entry or stay depending on the residence permit sought (such as family reuni˚cation) \\nand for naturalization. For instance, as reported by the MIPEX 2015, countries with language requirements \\nfor permanent residence increased from one EU country in 1990 to 18 in 2014.\\n43While States™ support to language acquisition is key, language requirements Œ on which are conditioned entry, \\nstay or naturalization in a country Œ may be counterproductive for migrants™ inclusion. In fact, countries \\nwith lower language requirements turn out to be the most favourable for migrants™ inclusion. Language tests \\ncan indeed deter migrants from applying for a particular status, rather than motivating them to master the \\nlanguage.\\n44 These tests can also exacerbate vulnerability faced by some migrants who are unable to pass them \\n\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n40 See \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n41\\n\\n42\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n43\\n\\n44\\n193due to different factors, such as age, literacy, as well as health, family or economic reasons. For instance, \\nevidence supports that age is negatively correlated with one™s ability to learn a new language.\\n45 Research highlights a paradox in focusing on national language acquisition in societies that increasingly \\npromote multilingualism.\\n46 In certain cities of the United States, for instance, such as Miami, Spanish may \\nbe more important than English to work in some sectors.\\n47 In some communities, research has found that \\nmoving away from language assimilation to a multilinguistic approach in schools supports migrant students™ \\neducational outcomes and, ultimately, decreases the likelihood of discrimination and improves their sense of \\ninclusion.\\n48 Education \\nAlong with work prospects, migration can be motivated by migrants™ willingness to access higher quality \\neducation in another country.\\n49 Education has a positive in˜uence on migrants™ employment and social \\nparticipation in the receiving society, which tends to view migrants more positively when they have attained \\nhigher educational quali˚cations.\\n50 For migrant children, access to primary education is a fundamental human \\nright, regardless of their migration status (see appendix B). However, migrants™ educational outcomes are \\nstill lower than those of their native counterparts, especially for ˚rst-generation migrants. The educational \\nperformance of migrants depends on a range of factors, including their language skills, socioeconomic and \\ncultural backgrounds, and age at migration.\\n51 While policy responses are important in improving migrants™ education levels, the MIPEX 2015 notes that \\n ﬁ[e]ducation emerges as the greatest weakness in integration policies in most countriesﬂ.\\n52 Beyond countries \\ncovered in MIPEX 2015, there more generally remain issues in migrants™ access to education. This is especially \\nstriking for refugee children. Four million refugee children were out of school in 2017 out of the 7.4 million \\nof school age under UNHCR mandate Œ more than half of all refugee children worldwide.\\n53 As for migrant \\nchildren, their full inclusion in national education systems is important, including for those whose education \\ntends to be left to the humanitarian sector in countries with high numbers of refugees. With 1 million \\nrefugees of school age in 2018, Turkey has committed to include all Syrian refugee children previously \\nattending temporary education centres into its national education system by 2020.\\n54 Challenges in accessing education also exist for other migrant children. Administrative formalities in some \\ncountries may pose obstacles for migrants to enrol their children at school, especially if they lack some \\ndocumentation or are in an irregular situation. Schools™ obligations to report irregular migrant children to \\nthe authorities or provide government authorities with access to children™s data may further deter migrant \\n45\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n50\\n\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n52\\n\\n53\\n54\\n194children from attending school due to fear of deportation.\\n55 To ensure migrant children™s enrolment and \\nattendance, some countries have established ˚rewalls between immigration authorities and schools.\\n56 In \\nGermany, for example, the obligation for schools to disclose pupils™ data to the police was abolished in 2011.\\n57 Simpli˚ed formalities for school enrolment, including for migrant children lacking certain identi˚cation \\ndocuments, have also been put in place in some countries, such as Thailand.\\n58 Challenges for migrant children™s education go beyond access to school. Other obstacles to improve their \\neducation outcomes include the lack of education tailored to their needs and, less commonly, their segregation \\nfrom natives in classrooms.\\n59 The composition of classrooms plays a role, as a high concentration of migrant \\nchildren negatively in˜uences their educational outcomes. Research also suggests that digital technologies \\ncould help reduce the gap in educational achievements between migrant and native children by supporting \\nmigrant children in doing their schoolwork at home, including through access to educational material in their \\nnative language.\\n60 More generally, migrant children may experience prejudice and discrimination at school. Schools can, \\nhowever, serve as spaces for promoting tolerance and social cohesion. An increasing number of countries are \\nintegrating diversity into their curricula, but teachers still need support and training to teach effectively in \\ndiverse classrooms,\\n61 including through induction or mentorship programmes.\\n62Labour market inclusion \\nWith 164 million migrant workers worldwide in 2017, representing 59.2\\n per cent of all international migrants \\nand 70.1\\n per cent of those of working age, labour market inclusion is a key policy area for States.\\n63 Its \\nimportance is increasingly emphasized in terms of migrants™ economic contributions to receiving and origin \\nsocieties (see chapter 5 of this report). It has, for instance, been estimated that, while migrants contributed \\n9.4 per cent of the global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015, better inclusion, including in terms of \\nemployment, could add an additional USD 1 trillion per year to the global GDP.\\n64 For migrants, just as it is for \\nnon-migrants, labour market inclusion brings greater economic security, and enhances their well-being and \\nsense of belonging in receiving societies.\\n65 Labour market inclusion consists of different dimensions, ranging from access to employment and general \\nor targeted support, to protection of migrant workers.\\n66 Among these, access to employment is an important \\nfactor. Migrants™ employment rates are commonly lower than those of non-migrants. In the European Union, \\n55\\n56\\n\\n\\n\\n59\\n\\n\\n60\\n\\n61\\n62\\n63\\n\\n\\n64\\n\\n\\n65\\n66\\n\\n195for instance, the unemployment rate of migrants was 13.3\\n per cent in 2017, compared with 6.9\\n per cent for \\nthe native-born.\\n67 Nevertheless, substantial differences exist between countries and groups, as labour market \\ninclusion depends on the socioeconomic situation and policies of each country, as well as on migrants™ \\ndemographic and individual characteristics (such as age, gender, language skills or quali˚cations) and \\nthe circumstances of their migration. Overall, for example, refugees and those who migrated for family \\nreuni˚cation have a lower likelihood of ˚nding a job than other migrants.\\n68 To improve the employment rate \\nof refugees, Switzerland launched a new Arti˚cial Intelligence pilot programme in 2018. This programme \\nrelies on an algorithm that determines in which area of the country a particular asylum seeker should be \\nplaced to maximize his/her employment likelihood.\\n69 General and targeted support for migrants is important for improving migrants™ access to employment. \\nIn addition to language training, vocational training has been found to be effective in improving access, \\nespecially if it encompasses a practical on-the-job training component.\\n70 Other tools considered effective \\ninclude job search assistance programmes and wage subsidy programmes (that is, subsidized employment in \\nthe private sector).\\n71 The inability to have quali˚cations recognized or skills validated also remains an issue, as it restricts access \\nto certain jobs and leads to overquali˚cation in lower-skilled positions.\\n72 Working below skill level may also \\nincrease the risk of distress for migrants and result in lower psychosocial well-being.\\n73 This issue is not only \\nlinked to the absence of recognition programmes, but also to the lack of awareness and information about \\nsuch programmes or to their cost and complexity.\\n74 The establishment of a one-stop shop for recognition in \\nsome countries, such as in Denmark, can be valuable to simplify and centralize recognition programmes under \\none roof.\\n75The feminization of migration: Calling for a gender-sensitive approach to inclusion \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n69\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n196\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nl  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFamily reunification \\nFamily reuni˚cation is a central component of the right to family life. On this basis, nationals and migrants, \\nincluding refugees, can act as ﬁsponsorsﬂ of family members living abroad in order for them to be reunited. \\nAlthough not all migrants want to be reunited with their families in the receiving country,\\n76 for those who \\nwish to do so, family reuni˚cation can play an important part in their inclusion. Family reuni˚cation is not \\nonly about improving family life, but also social inclusion (through engagement with schools or community-\\n\\n\\n197based associations) and political participation.\\n77 Evidence also indicates that family reunion enhances \\nmigrants™ labour market inclusion.\\n78 According to a longitudinal survey of immigrants in Canada, family \\nmembers play a particularly important role in supporting and facilitating migrants™ entry and inclusion into \\nthe labour market, especially during the ˚rst four years after arrival.\\n79 Family reuni˚cation has become an important component of many States™ policies, especially in Western \\ncountries. Family migration accounted for 38\\n per cent of all permanent migration in OECD countries in 2016, \\nrepresenting 1.8 million family migrants, of which 1.6 million were registered under family reuni˚cation and \\nthe remainder as accompanying migrant workers.\\n80 Family reuni˚cation is often limited to certain types of \\nfamily members and subject to speci˚c conditions.\\n81 It is usually restricted to the immediate family members \\n(such as spouses, children below the age of 18 and dependent relatives), which may not re˜ect the social \\ncon˚gurations of migrants™ families.\\n82 The sponsor is often required to provide proof of suf˚cient ˚nancial \\nmeans to support his/her family members.\\n83 As this income requirement may raise dif˚culties for refugees, \\nsome countries have exempted them or lowered the minimum salary required.\\n84 While these conditions typically relate to migration management, other requirements for family reuni˚cation \\nthat are adopted for the declared purpose of ensuring migrants™ inclusion can be counterproductive. Pre-\\nentry language tests that sponsored family members are sometimes required to pass to be able to reunite \\nwith migrants in the receiving country are a case in point.\\n85 These tests can be prepared with prior language \\ncourses, but they are usually expensive, not easily accessible in rural areas of the country of origin and have \\na disproportionate negative impact on some family members, such as the elderly or refugees, who are less \\nlikely to succeed due to their vulnerable situations.\\n86 Rather than improving the educational achievements \\nand labour market inclusion of sponsored migrants, they may discourage migrants from applying for family \\nreuni˚cation or delay family reunion. Delays can undermine the potential bene˚ts for migrants™ inclusion, \\nas family reunion will raise more dif˚culties for families when occurring after a long period of separation \\nbetween sponsors and their relatives.\\n87 Political participation \\nMigrants™ participation in the political life of their receiving countries can take different forms, ranging \\nfrom voting in local, national or regional elections and standing as candidates in local elections, to joining \\nassociations and political parties or being consulted through local, national or regional consultative bodies.\\n88 Compared with other policy areas of inclusion, such as language or employment, less attention has been \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n198devoted to political participation in policymaking and research.\\n89 However, migrants™ political participation \\ncan help States maintain the legitimacy of their democratic systems, realize migrants™ inclusion and promote \\nsocial cohesion.\\n90 It gives migrants the opportunity to have a say on policies that concern them and can \\nincrease their feeling of belonging in the receiving society.\\n91Migrants are not signi˚cantly less politically active than nationals. Their level of political participation \\ndepends on a range of factors, including contextual/structural and individual ones. The degree of political \\nparticipation that migrants can exercise depends ˚rst on the receiving country.\\n92 While most countries do \\nnot currently give migrants the right to vote (especially in Africa and Asia), some offer voting rights in \\nnational elections (see text box below), and an increasing number provide them with the right to vote in \\nlocal elections (for example, in Europe, the Americas, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea). By contrast, \\nthe right to stand in elections is more limited, even for countries offering the right to vote. In addition to \\ndiffering political opportunities across countries, migrants™ political participation is in˜uenced by the culture \\nof political participation in the receiving country and the level of participation and democratic tradition in \\nmigrants™ countries of origin.\\n93 Countries where migrants can vote in national elections\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIndividual factors that in˜uence migrants™ political participation include migrants™ demographic and personal \\ncharacteristics, especially as the level of participation increases with age and the level of education. The \\nduration of residence and naturalization also positively impact on migrants™ political participation, and \\nsecond-generation migrants are thus often more active than the ˚rst generation.\\n94While it is dif˚cult to measure the impact of policies on migrants™ political participation, MIPEX 2015 suggests \\nthat countries with inclusive naturalization policies tend to have stronger political participation policies.\\n95 \\n90\\n\\n91\\n\\n92\\n\\n93\\n\\n94\\n95\\n\\n199In general, however, there remains a clear discrepancy between the high diversity of receiving societies \\nand migrants™ representation at different political levels.\\n96 Beyond the State, political parties thus have a \\nparticular role to play in increasing migrants™ political representation and diversity. \\nNaturalizationNaturalization is the process and acquisition of nationality by a non-national. Migrants can become \\nnaturalized if they meet legal criteria and apply through appropriate channels. Although naturalization \\nis often considered a milestone for migrants™ inclusion in the receiving country, it is not an end in itself \\nbecause inclusion remains an ongoing process.\\n97 That said, naturalization often provides migrants™ full access \\nto entitlements in receiving countries (such as voting and candidacy rights). Evidence demonstrates that \\nnaturalization increases migrants™ labour market and social inclusion,\\n98 their level of political participation,\\n99 and their sense of belonging in the receiving country.\\n100 Given the importance of naturalization for migrants and their inclusion, it comes as no surprise that a large \\nshare of migrants are or want to become citizens of their receiving countries.\\n101 However, not all migrants \\nwant to be naturalized, as it depends on a range of individual and contextual factors. Most notably, migrants \\nfrom developing countries have a greater propensity to naturalize, because it ensures security to remain \\nand eliminates the risk of being forced to return to their countries of origin, especially when these are \\ncharacterized by a lower level of development, political instability or a non-democratic regime.\\n102The most signi˚cant factor in˜uencing migrants™ likelihood to naturalize remains the receiving country™s \\ncitizenship policies: the more inclusive such policies are, the higher the likelihood of naturalization will \\nbe.\\n103 In contrast to migration/inclusion policies, all countries have adopted nationality laws regulating the \\nacquisition of nationality by descent, birth and/or naturalization. As citizenship is closely linked to national \\nidentity, naturalization can be politically controversial in some countries.\\n104 In countries that do not allow \\nindividuals to hold dual nationality, migrants may have to relinquish their nationality of the country of \\norigin to obtain that of the receiving country, which may deter them from naturalizing.\\n105 Naturalization \\ncan be even more politically delicate with large ˜ows of migrants, including refugees, although the United \\nRepublic of Tanzania has succeeded in naturalizing more than 170,000 Burundian refugees since 2007.\\n106While a few countries grant citizenship to migrants in exchange for ˚nancial investments (such as Antigua and \\nBarbuda, and Malta),\\n107 in most countries, naturalization is subject to speci˚c conditions. These requirements \\n96\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n99\\n\\n\\n100\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n101\\n102\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n103\\n\\n\\n104\\n\\n105\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n106\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n200commonly include a minimum duration of legal residency, knowledge of national language(s) and, sometimes, \\nculture, evidence of good character and the payment of fees for the naturalization process. The length of \\nresidence required differs from one State to another. While it is on average of 7 years in countries covered \\nin MIPEX 2015, it goes as high as 35 years in the Central African Republic.\\n108 In addition to the high fees \\nsometimes required for naturalization, the most contentious requirement relates to mandatory language and \\ncivic tests that migrants must pass in some countries.\\n109 These tests sometimes require knowledge about the \\nreceiving country that even some nationals may not possess.\\n110 Situation on the ground: The role of local actors and migrants \\nWhile States can foster migrants™ inclusion through national measures and policies, inclusion happens ˚rst \\nand foremost ﬁon the groundﬂ. This section ˚rst presents the role of the local level, especially cities, where \\neveryday practices may be disconnected from national inclusion policies. While the local level is key for \\nrealizing migrants™ inclusion, the section also highlights the role of migrants themselves, who are essential \\nactors of their own inclusion.\\nThe role of local actors  \\nAs inclusion primarily occurs at the local level, local actors can play an important role in supporting and \\nfostering migrants™ inclusion. These local actors are of a different nature and can range from local communities, \\nincluding local resident and diaspora communities, and local civil society organizations to local authorities. \\nCommunity centres provide spaces for interactions between locals and migrants in a given neighbourhood, \\nand give access to a wide range of services and activities within the community. The Neighbourhood Houses \\nin Greater Vancouver, for instance, provide support for employment, day and after-school care, activities for \\nseniors, parent groups or sociocultural events.\\n111 In Europe, civil society organizations were important in \\nassisting and sustaining longer-term initiatives for the inclusion of the increased number of migrants who \\narrived in 2015Œ2016 in countries such as Austria, Germany and Sweden. This is notably illustrated by the \\nEuropean Prize for Civil Society, which rewards initiatives taken by organizations, including local non-pro˚t \\nfoundations and associations, in the ˚eld of identity and integration, and which in 2016 received a total of \\n284 applications from organizations in 26 EU member States.\\n112Alongside the involvement of local communities and civil society organizations, the role of local governments, \\nespecially cities, in migrants™ inclusion has attracted increased attention due to migration patterns and \\nprocesses of urbanization. Urban areas are the main destinations for migrants across the world, given the high \\nreturn for migrants™ human capital.\\n113 \\n\\n\\n109\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n110\\n\\n\\n111\\n\\n112\\n113\\n\\n201Cities have an important role to play as spaces of inclusion, because they are the main sites of migration/\\ninclusion policy implementation. They are the ones giving life to a greater or lesser extent to States™ \\ninternational obligations and commitments, especially with regard to housing, health, employment and \\neducation.\\n114 Some cities deliver services to all migrants, regardless of their migration status, ensuring access \\nto housing, health, employment and education. For instance, some cities, such as New York, have ID cards \\ngranted to all residents (ﬁnationalsﬂ and migrants alike, including irregular migrants), which facilitate access \\nto numerous services and serve as means of identi˚cation.\\n115 Some cities also increasingly rely on innovative and pragmatic solutions to improve migrants™ inclusion. \\nFor instance, this is the case in European cities, such as in Austria or the Netherlands, which have taken \\ninitiatives driving policy changes at the national level.\\n116 Some cities in Flanders, Belgium, have developed \\nCentres for General Welfare to respond to the increasing number of migrants and care for their needs. These \\ncentres combine a variety of services centralized under the same roof, such as housing, health care and \\npsychosocial support for migrants.\\n117 A similar one-stop shop model has been applied in Lisbon, Portugal, to \\nimprove migrants™ access to public services that are key for their inclusion.\\n118Cities may also positively impact on migrants™ inclusion through multicultural urban planning, when \\nundertaken to strengthen the inclusion and resilience of diverse communities.\\n119 However, urban planning \\nfor migrants™ inclusion may raise more dif˚culties in informal urban spaces that have developed with rapid \\nurbanization, such as (peri-urban) slums.\\n120 More generally, slums often escape the reach of national and \\nlocal authorities, resulting, for instance, in lack of access to basic services for residents, including migrants. \\nAs illustrated in the text box below, in the speci˚c context of Africa, these informal settlements have \\npredominantly been formed in cities of the Global South, although peri-urban areas are developing in the \\nGlobal North as well, such as in Lisbon, Athens and Rome.\\nMigration and inclusion in the context of urban transformation in Africa\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc 114\\n\\n\\n\\n115\\n116\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n119\\n\\n120\\n\\n202\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite the role played by cities, their importance for migrants™ inclusion, including in policy development, \\nhas yet to be duly acknowledged at the national level.\\n121 Some cities have developed their own policies and \\nactions to foster inclusion, in recognition that inclusion needs to be supported at different governance \\nlevels within a country. From this perspective, the interculturalist approach taken by some cities has been \\ndepicted as ﬁa policy rebellion of cities against the state domination of policy in recent decadesﬂ.\\n122 Far from \\nindividual instances of rebellion carried out by a few cities, the idea of interculturalist cities has gained \\ntraction over the last decade. In 2008, for instance, the Council of Europe launched the Intercultural Cities \\nprogramme for supporting cities in capitalizing in diversity.\\n123 At the time of writing, the programme totalled \\n135 participating cities in country members of the Council of Europe, as well as in Australia, Canada, Israel, \\nJapan, Mexico, Morocco and the Unites States of America. Participating cities are indexed according to their \\nintercultural policies, governance and practices.\\n124 Research on the results of the Intercultural Cities Index \\nsuggests a positive correlation between the scores cities obtain and local well-being: the more intercultural \\npolicies are, the better the quality of life is.\\n125 While some national governments consider municipalities \\nas key actors in policymaking and governance of migrants™ inclusion, as is the case in Turkey,\\n126 in other \\ncountries, the proactive role of cities has led to frictions between city and national levels. This has been \\nthe case, for instance, with sanctuary cities that have adopted their own policies and measures to protect \\nmigrants, including those in an irregular situation.\\n127 These policies have at times been adopted in reaction \\nto restrictive national migration and citizenship policies, and have established cities as spaces of inclusion.\\n128 121\\n122\\n123\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n124\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n125\\n\\n126\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n203While cities are active players in the global governance of migration,\\n129 national governments are key in \\nscaling up initiatives developed by cities and sharing good practices globally. The role of cities in organizing \\nappropriate services to care for migrants™ needs is increasingly recognized by States in global initiatives, such \\nas in the New Urban Agenda following the Habitat III Conference in Ecuador in 2016.\\n130 Through a whole-of-\\ngovernment approach, the importance of the local level is also explicitly acknowledged and mainstreamed \\nthroughout the Global Compact for Migration.\\n131 Objectives 15 and 16 are of particular relevance, as they \\nboth emphasize the role of the local level (including local authorities) for providing migrants™ access to basic \\nservices and empowering them and societies to realize full inclusion and social cohesion (see chapter 11 of \\nthis report). \\nRecognizing migrants™ agencyBeyond the State and local levels, migrants play a crucial role, not just as passive subjects of inclusion \\npolicies, but also as active actors of their own inclusion. Migrants™ entrepreneurship is perhaps one of the \\nmost obvious illustrations of their agency for their economic inclusion. Beyond success stories such as that \\nof Silicon Valley in California, where half of the high-tech companies were founded by migrants,\\n132 there exist \\nmany examples of migrants™ entrepreneurship (see chapter 5 of this report). For instance, Syrian refugee-\\nowned companies have developed in response to refugees™ lack of formal employment opportunities and the \\nneed to make a living.\\n133Migrants are not only agents of their own inclusion but also actively support other migrants, while striving, \\nmore generally, for social cohesion. Among many other examples of migrants™ initiatives, a school established \\nby Congolese refugees in a Ugandan refugee camp has been depicted as a success for migrant children™s \\ninclusion. Since its creation in 2009, some 800 pupils have progressed to secondary school and 40 study in \\nuniversities around the world. As the founders put it, ﬁwe realize that through education you can never be \\ncalled a refugee foreverﬂ.\\n134  Technology has also been used by migrants to support the inclusion of other \\nmigrants in receiving countries through YouTube videos to counter xenophobia and discrimination\\n135 or with \\nthe development of smartphone applications, as illustrated in the text box below.\\n129\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n130\\n\\n131\\n132\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n133\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n134\\n135\\n204Migrants™ use of technology for inclusion \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMigrants™ inclusion in communities and countries does not require relinquishing one™s identity or ties with \\ncommunities and countries of origin. Migrants increasingly act as transnational actors,\\n136 as explained by \\nDaniel from Guatemala, who has been living for 30 years in Costa Rica: \\nMy home could be a Guatemalan territorial space but with windows and doors open to Costa Rica. My home became a place where both visions and cultures can grow and live together.\\nThat is the biggest challenge of living in another country: living a little here and a little there. \\nYou live the two visions of the world every day, one from the home country and the other one \\nfrom the host country. Expressions, food, culture, world vision: the two countries intersect \\nin everyday life.\\n137Migrants™ transnational lives can nonetheless be at odds with expectations of migrants as ﬁsettlersﬂ, and can \\nresult in their allegiance to the receiving country being called into question.\\n138 They may be perceived as \\na threat to social cohesion, with the risk of being discriminated against and excluded. However, migrants™ \\ndiscrimination and exclusion can entail a high cost for both migrants and receiving societies. For instance, \\nmigrants™ exclusion can affect their own well-being, as illustrated by a study on the effects of discrimination \\n136\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n205at work on the well-being of Russian and Estonian migrants in Finland. Perceived discrimination accordingly \\npredicts negative outcomes in terms of general and mental health for both groups of migrants.\\n139 Migrants™ \\nexclusion can also negatively impact on their contributions to trade, skills and labour supply, cultural transfer \\nand exchange, which all consist of major bene˚ts for receiving societies (see chapter 5 of this report). \\nMore generally, migrants™ exclusion constitutes a risk for social cohesion. On rare occasions, social exclusion \\ncan act as a driver of radicalization to violent extremism.\\n140 Although the likelihood remains low as terrorist \\nattacks have not been primarily perpetrated by migrants,\\n141 such consequences and costs entailed by migrants™ \\nsocial exclusion are arguably too high and have to be addressed. These constitute an additional factor to be \\ntaken into account to strengthen migrants™ inclusion, in order to reduce the risk of radicalization for the \\nwell-being of societies and communities.\\nThe various costs of exclusion and migrants™ agency support the need to more fully involve migrants in the \\nformulation of migration/inclusion policies. These policies could bene˚t from better understanding how \\nmigrants view their inclusion process, what their needs are and what potential policy responses could more \\neffectively support their inclusion.\\n142 More active involvement of migrants at the policy level would also be in \\nline with the Global Compact for Migration, which emphasizes the need to empower migrants to achieve full \\ninclusion and social cohesion.\\n143 Migrants™ views to inform inclusion policies: The potential of migrant surveys \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n139\\n\\n140\\n\\n141\\n\\n142\\n143\\n206Conclusion \\nThis chapter offers an overview of what migrants™ inclusion entails in policy and practice, the factors and \\nobstacles thereto, and how it is approached by different stakeholders. However, it also illustrates the dif˚culty \\nto address the question of migrants™ inclusion at the global level, as it intrinsically remains a national issue. \\nThis is re˜ected in the Global Compact for Migration, where the actions linked to Objective\\n 16 on empowering \\nmigrants and societies to realize full inclusion and social cohesion remain largely aspirational (see chapter\\n 11 \\nof this report).\\nWhile there cannot be a one-size-˚ts-all approach to inclusion, due to its highly personal and contextual \\nnature, three main policy implications can be drawn from this chapter to foster migrants™ inclusion and social \\ncohesion: \\nŁ The adoption of holistic inclusion policies has the potential to improve the effectiveness of policy \\nresponses in the ˚eld of inclusion.\\n As seen in this chapter, despite the emphasis sometimes placed on \\nlabour market inclusion, the different policy areas are closely interdependent, as inclusion outcomes in \\none speci˚c policy area will likely impact on others. Conversely, the absence of holistic inclusion policies \\nmay be costly for both migrants and receiving societies. Single policy responses in one speci˚c policy \\narea will likely be ineffective in improving migrants™ overall inclusion if not complemented by measures \\nin other areas and supported by a coherent policy strategy. The risk is not only for migrants to end \\nup being excluded and marginalized, but to create social tensions undermining social cohesion in the \\nreceiving society.  \\nŁ More inclusive policy responses in a wide range of related policy areas leads to deeper and more \\nsustainable inclusion outcomes.\\n While this may sound logical, it is particularly striking with regard to \\nlanguage requirements, political participation and naturalization. By contrast, more restrictive policies \\nhave the risk of being counterproductive, especially when used for migration management purposes. \\nConditions for family reuni˚cation that are meant to ensure that reunited family members will integrate \\nin the receiving society, especially pre-entry language tests, can in practice limit the number of migrants \\nbene˚ting from family reuni˚cation at the expense of supporting the inclusion of migrant sponsors and \\ntheir relatives. \\nŁ The important role already played by local actors and migrants calls for further strengthening their \\ninvolvement in developing and (re-)evaluating national inclusion policies.\\n Increased involvement \\nand empowerment of cities would help in mitigating tensions between local and national levels, because \\nof discrepancies in how inclusion is approached. As the spaces where inclusion primarily occurs, cities \\nand other local authorities are also the best placed to inform about the challenges of inclusion and \\ngood practices that can be implemented. As for migrants, their involvement in policymaking has so far \\nnot re˜ected how active they have been in practice for their own inclusion and that of other migrants. \\nIf their voices are increasingly heard today, their inclusion needs and aspirations are yet to be more \\nthoroughly explored and taken into account to improve the effectiveness of inclusion policies. \\n208\\nCHARLES HUI\\n\\n\\n2097MIGRATION AND HEALTH: CURRENT ISSUES, \\nGOVERNANCE AND KNOWLEDGE GAPS1IntroductionThere is a dynamic and complex relationship between migration and health. Migration can lead to greater \\nexposure to health risks, such as those migrant workers working in conditions of precarious employment \\nwith limited access to affordable health care. Migration can also be linked to improved health Œ for instance, \\nafter moving from a context of persecution and fear of violence to a safe environment\\n. In this chapter, \\nwe examine the four key aspects of migration and health: (a) the health of individual migrants (ﬁmigrant \\nhealthﬂ); (b)\\n the ways in which migration can affect the health of populations (ﬁpublic healthﬂ); (c) health-\\ncare systems responses; and (d) the global governance of migration and health. \\nThe ˚rst aspect Œ migrant health Œ can be de˚ned as the differences in health found between migrants and \\npopulations at both origin and destination, and across different migration settings, such as \\nlabour migration, \\ninternational and internal displacement, or irregular migration\\n. Whether individual migrants will experience \\nimprovements or declines in their health status will depend partly on their interactions with the multiple \\nfactors that determine their health before, during and after their migration journey. Such factors Œ known as \\nthe social determinants of health Œ include access to safe transit, quality housing and health care.\\nThe second issue Œ public health Œ focuses on how migration can affect the health of populations, including \\nthe ways in which healthy migrants can promote social and economic development and progress towards the \\nglobal target of universal health coverage (UHC), which aims to ensure access to affordable and quality health \\ncare for all.\\n2 However, if poorly managed, migration can negatively affect populations™ health. For example, a \\nmigrant mother struggling to access documentation may be unable to access timely health care for her child \\nŒ including vaccinations Œ for fear of arrest, detention or deportation. This could contribute to the spread \\nof communicable diseases, such as measles, across and within borders, with negative health effects for the \\nentire population.\\nThe third issue concerns systems responses to migration and health.\\n The development of migrant-sensitive \\nhealth-care responses and the monitoring of migrant health, through a Migration and Health in All Policies \\n(MHiAP) approach, can address the health needs of migrants. Poorly managed, inadequate or discriminatory \\nimmigration and health system responses can have multiple negative consequences for the health of migrants \\nand the communities with which they interact. \\nThe fourth issue is the global governance of migration and health. This involves a focus on the ways in \\nwhich migration and health can be mainstreamed into global governance processes, including identifying key \\nstrategic opportunities to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHARLES HUI\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 7 Œ \\n210The chapter examines these four key issues. It starts with a brief overview of de˚nitions and determinants. \\nIt then provides an overview of the factors that determine the health vulnerabilities and resilience factors \\nof diverse migrant groups. Systems responses, and an overview of current approaches to the governance of \\nmigration and health, are then outlined. Key evidence gaps are highlighted, and the chapter concludes by \\nemphasizing the importance of investing in effective migration and health governance, and how current \\napproaches could ideally be strengthened. \\nMigration and health: Key factsŁ \\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Ł \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne Ł \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Ł \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni211Ł \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDefinitions and determinants \\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) de˚nes good health as a ﬁstate of complete physical, mental, and \\nsocial well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or in˚rmityﬂ.\\n3 This recognition of mental and social \\nwell-being, in addition to physical well-being, is critical, and emphasizes the importance of viewing health \\nholistically. The state of a person™s health is shaped not only by one™s access to health services, but by a \\nmultitude of factors, which are termed the ﬁdeterminants of healthﬂ. Figure 1 shows how the determinants \\nof health can be applied to migrants across the migration cycle. Individual determinants are factors such \\nas age, sex and genetic predisposition to disease, and the epidemiological pro˚le of a given context and \\nthe disease exposures associated with it. Structural determinants are usually politically mediated Œ such \\nas legal frameworks and societal attitudes towards migrants Œ and can result in a range of inequalities in \\nsocioeconomic status. For migrants, structural determinants of health include the conditions associated with \\nthe different phases of their migration journey Œ pre-migration, movement, arrival and integration, and (for \\nsome) return. \\n\\n212\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPre-migraon phaseŁPre-migratory factors beyond individual genec and biological characteriscs include:\\n epidemiological proes at origin (e.g. endemicity, infec\\nous and chronic disease paerns), environmental, pocal and personal exposures and events, such as trauma stemming from protracted concts, human rights violaons and interpersonal violence.  ŁHealth status is inenced by health sec\\ntor at desaon (health service equity, coverage, quality, access) and health protecon/insurance schemes that are aordable, portable, etc.ŁLinguisc, cultural and geographic proximity to desaon.Movement phaseŁDuraon, circumstances and coon of journey.ŁSingle or mass movement.ŁViolence, exploitaon and other abuses.ŁTravel coons and mode (especially for irregular migrants).Arrival and integraon phaseŁDomesc migraon policies and legal frameworks oen govern migrants™ \\naccess to health services (based on their legal status).ŁEpidemiological proe, environmental, pocal exposures at desaon.

Cross-cung aspectsGender, age, socioeconomic status, genec factorsWell-being of migrants and their familiesSource:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n213The various legal frameworks associated with different phases of the migration journey are important structural \\ndeterminants of migrant health. This is because a migrant™s legal status in a country can determine, for \\nexample, the extent to which they can access safe working conditions as well as the quality and affordability \\nof health care. As illustrated in ˚gure 1, there are multiple determinants of health Œ both individual and \\nstructural Œ that can have both positive and negative effects on health. An irregular migrant, for example, is \\nunlikely to ˚nd work in the formal sector, and has to rely on the precarious informal sector, where work can \\nbe both unsafe and Œ often Œ illegal. As a result, irregular migrants may experience greater vulnerabilities \\nto poor health, including increased exposure to infectious diseases, violence and injury. They are likely to \\nface many challenges in accessing quality health-care services, and have very limited (if any) access to social \\nprotection services.\\nMigrant healthThe ˚eld of migration and health \\nexplores the patterns in health found between migrants and the host \\npopulation, and across different migrant groups\\n, including in contexts where the host population may be \\nstruggling to meet its own mental, social and physical well-being needs.\\n4 Exploring these patterns is important \\nfor several reasons. Firstly, the development of public health strategies over many decades recognizes the need \\nfor inclusiveness Œ the need to incorporate whole societies when addressing communicable disease control, \\nsuch as through immunization programmes. The exclusion of subpopulations Œ such as migrant groups Œ must \\nbe avoided.\\n5 There is a signi˚cant burden of tuberculosis (TB), HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and vaccine-\\npreventable diseases in migrant populations. Addressing this important group in surveillance, screening and \\nlinkage to care is crucial to meet the public health targets of countries and regions.\\n6 Secondly, some health-\\nrelated interventions developed for speci˚c subpopulations, such as migrant groups, can provide or lead to \\nhealth bene˚ts for the whole population.\\n7 Thirdly, ensuring the best possible health of migrants before, \\nduring and following their migration journeys enables them to maximize their inclusion and contributions to \\ntheir host society, facilitate their support to families of origin, and minimize potential health-related costs \\nborne by both the destination country and migrants themselves.\\n8 Even in acute displacement situations, such \\nas large-scale refugee ˜ows, immediate health issues (along with food and shelter) are of primary concern, \\nand dedicated resources are needed to meet these critical needs for the good of individuals, local communities \\nand the broader society.\\n9 Understanding health vulnerability and resilience is central to the ˚eld of migration and health. Migrants are \\nnot a homogenous group, nor are their needs, health vulnerabilities and resilience factors. Gender is a key \\ndimension that particularly needs to be considered (see the text box below).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n214Gender dimensions in mortality and abuse in ﬁlow-skilledﬂ labour migrants \\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth vulnerability can be de˚ned as the degree to which an individual is unable to anticipate, cope \\nwith, resist and recover from the impacts of diseases or epidemics.\\n10 While most often associated with low \\nsocioeconomic status, health vulnerability can also arise when people are isolated, insecure and defenceless \\nin the face of risk, shock or stress, including during and following migration journeys. Health resilience, on \\nthe other hand, results from individuals having access to the resources needed to cope with a threat to health \\nor to resist the impact of a health hazard. Such resources can be physical or material, but they can also be \\nfound in the skills or attributes of individuals and their social networks.\\nSome migrants are healthier than the communities they leave and the communities to which they arrive, \\ndisplaying levels of resilience to the health challenges encountered.\\n11 However, these health bene˚ts can \\nrapidly wear away, and migrants may struggle to access positive determinants of health, resulting in a \\nrange of health vulnerabilities that are more pronounced than those of the local population. For example, \\nprenatal and postnatal health complications are often worse in migrant women. Not only are experiences \\nwith pregnancy-related health care more likely to be negative, there is an increased risk of mental health \\ndisorders, maternal mortality and premature births.\\n12 A systematic review of perinatal health outcomes and \\ncare among asylum seekers and refugees reported that perinatal mental health disorders such as postnatal \\ndepression were more frequent in migrant women than in women from host countries. The study also reported \\na twofold relative risk of mortality of migrant women related to preeclampsia/eclampsia and thrombosis. \\n10\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\n215As outlined in table 1, those migrants with the greatest health vulnerabilities are those in situations that \\ndiminish their capacity to anticipate, cope with, resist and recover from the changes and challenges associated \\nwith the different phases of the migration process. Some migrants can be exposed to trauma, exploitation \\nand abuse during perilous journeys. They may experience psychosocial stressors, nutritional de˚ciencies, \\ndehydration, exposure to infectious diseases, a lack of health-care services or continuation of treatments, \\nand face the unhealthy consequences of certain settings, such as immigration detention centres or informal \\nand illegal work environments. The literature on these issues is predominantly from high-income destination \\ncountries, focusing on speci˚c health issues, categories of migrants, and source countries.\\n13 Some literature \\ncombines different migrant groups together into descriptive studies, and most do not have comparisons with \\nthe host populations. For these reasons, it can be dif˚cult to generalize from the limited data, but many of \\nthese health issues are consistent across studies, as summarized in table 1.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ S\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc \\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 13\\n\\n216\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne \\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Source:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublic healthThe second aspect related to migration and health is on how migration can affect the health of populations\\n (public health). As outlined above, migrants can face challenges in addressing their mental, social and \\nphysical well-being needs. Migrants who have limited or no ability to access positive determinants of health \\n(see ˚gure 1) can experience poor health outcomes, with various consequences for public health. This \\nsituation could itself be the result of dif˚culties faced in accessing a secure income, perhaps associated \\nwith challenges involved in obtaining the necessary documentation to work legally. Should they be unable \\nto access timely testing and treatment, chances for onward transmission of the disease to others within the \\ncommunity would increase, as would the likelihood of unnecessary costs being incurred by the host health-\\ncare system as a result. It is important to recognize that popular representations of migration and health tend \\nto be exaggerated by the media, sometimes as part of anti-immigrant political agendas, in which migration is \\npositioned as a threat to public health.\\nRegardless of the setting, if migrants access health care only when they are very sick, additional costs will \\nburden the health-care system. In contrast, health-care services Œ both preventative and curative Œ that are \\neasily accessible enable the health needs of migrants to be addressed before they become very sick, reducing \\noverall costs to health-care systems. When considering infectious diseases, delays in seeking treatment or \\nchallenges encountered when attempting to continue treatment for chronic infectious diseases such as TB \\n217and HIV can have negative effects for populations, as the potential for onward transmission of infection \\nmay increase. This is particularly true in the case of movement across international borders, where delays in \\nseeking care are associated with multiple factors, including the fear of engaging with public services when \\none is without legal status, or the outright denial of access to care by health-care providers. The emergence \\nof ﬁsanctuary citiesﬂ in countries with restrictive immigration regimes has in part stemmed from a need \\nto ensure that health-care services are available regardless of a person™s migration status. The ﬁsanctuary \\ncitiesﬂ movement is based on human rights principles and health equity approaches that prioritize access \\nto health care for undocumented migrants.\\n14 For instance, no signi˚cant differences in reports of physician \\ncommunication, or in measures of diabetes management between undocumented and documented immigrants, \\nexisted among Mexican immigrants receiving care in two immigration sanctuary areas in the United States \\nwhere people seeking health services are not asked about immigration legal status, nor is immigration status \\nreported to immigration of˚cials. Undocumented immigrants achieved comparable clinical outcomes and \\nreported similar experiences of health care as documented immigrants and United States-born Mexicans.\\n15Some groups of migrants Œ including refugees, asylum seekers and irregular migrants Œ may be particularly \\nvulnerable to infectious diseases and experience worse health outcomes than the host population, or come \\nfrom locations where certain infectious diseases are of high prevalence; these groups can bene˚t from targeted \\nscreening and interventions.\\n16 Their journeys from one place to another Œ including forced movements from \\ncon˜ict zones with severely compromised health-care services Œ may result in interruptions in vaccination \\nschedules, with potentially negative public health implications for both individual migrants and communities \\naffected by migration.\\n17Migration, both within a country and across national borders, is a key consideration in the control of infectious \\ndiseases. One such example is the case of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 (see text box below). \\nAnother example relates to interventions to address malaria. These require careful consideration of migration, \\nwhich has been shown to affect diagnosis and negatively impact access to treatment and continuity of \\ncare. This may contribute to the spread of antimalarial drug resistance.\\n18 Additionally, the reintroduction of \\nmalaria in countries reaching elimination through inbound migration presents further challenges to cross-\\nborder malaria control.\\n19 Recognizing its importance in the control of infectious diseases, migration has been \\nenshrined within the International Health Regulations and key disease control programmes in global health.\\n20 For example, the WHO framework for the global post-2015 ﬁEnd tuberculosis (TB) Strategyﬂ has identi˚ed \\nmigration and cross-border issues as a priority action area for countries with a low incidence of TB.\\n2114\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\n218Migration and disease control Œ The case of Ebola \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n219Health systems responsesThe third aspect of migration and health is how health-care systems respond to migration and health.\\n The \\nhealth-care system is itself a determinant of health and, depending on the policies and legal frameworks of \\nindividual States, migrants may not be granted adequate, equitable and affordable access to health services, \\nand/or local health systems may not have suf˚cient capacity to manage migrant health needs. For example, \\nin countries of protracted crisis, migrant children ˜eeing con˜ict settings and seeking asylum with their \\nfamilies are more likely to have not met their vaccination targets due to disruptions in health-care delivery in \\ncountries of origin. Where health services are available, certain migrant groups may ˚nd it dif˚cult to express \\nsymptomology and understand treatment instructions due to language barriers. Different cultural constructs \\nof illness causation, such as those concerning mental health, challenge effective clinical management.\\n22 They \\nmay also have dif˚culty with navigating unfamiliar health and welfare systems Œ especially when coming \\nfrom countries with severely disrupted health systems. \\nA systematic literature review of reported challenges in health-care delivery to migrants and refugees in high-\\nincome countries identi˚ed three main topics of challenges in health-care delivery: communication, continuity \\nof care and con˚dence.\\n23 Communication is critical for obvious diagnostic and treatment trajectories. The \\navailability of trained interpreters\\n from migrant communities was \\ndescribed as a key aspect in providing \\nmigrant-sensitive care. Training of such interpreters to ensure an ethical and professional approach to medical \\nconsultations was also highlighted. Continuity of care related to factors such as migrant understanding of \\nthe health-care system, integration and case management across different parts of the health-care system. \\nCon˚dence was the third most common topic mentioned and related to trust in the health-care provider, \\nensuring cultural sensitivity in care provision and the ability to have agency. Studies indicated that, in \\ncases where no trustful relationship was established, patients resorted to using traditional medicine and \\ntrusted ﬁtheir own resourcesﬂ from their community for treatment.\\n Conversely, a systematic review that \\ninvestigated the perceptions, attitudes and practices of health providers in the provision of health-care \\nservices for migrants found they were challenged not only by language and cultural barriers, but also by \\nresource constraints within their workplaces, and incoherence between professional ethics and domestic \\nlaws that limited migrants™ right to health care.\\n24 Health-care providers used innovative means to ensure care \\nprovision in managing such clinical cases with civil society groups.\\nA key component of improved systems responses is the development of ﬁmigrant-sensitive health systems and \\nprogrammes which aim to incorporate the needs of migrants into all aspects of health services, ˚nancing, \\npolicy, planning, implementation, and evaluationﬂ.\\n25 As outlined in appendix A, this includes measures to: \\nensure culturally sensitive and linguistically diverse health service provision; enable access to primary health \\ncare; include non-citizen groups within national disaster preparedness and response plans; and establish \\nreporting mechanisms within routine health information systems to ethically harness data to plan for migrant \\nneeds.\\n26 Often, migrants/ﬁnon-citizensﬂ are excluded within preparedness and response strategies at national \\nlevels.\\n2722\\n23\\n\\n24\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n220Migration and health indicators and metricsAccurate data on the health status, outcomes, and social determinants of migration health are an essential \\nprecondition for ensuring better monitoring and improving health and providing appropriate and accessible \\nhealth service. The World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions on migration health (61.17, 2008; 70.15, 2017) \\nand the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration\\n28 call on governments to better harness \\nmigration health data in order to formulate evidence-informed policy and practice interventions. However, the \\n2nd Global Consultation on Migration Health (2017)\\n29 and subsequent academic commissions\\n30 have indicated \\nmigration health data availability, quality and linkage to be highly variable, especially in low-to-middle-\\nincome countries. Little progress has also been made by member States and international organizations on \\nadvancing initiatives to improve migration health data collection and analysis at national, regional and \\nglobal levels. \\nSources of health data at country level are derived from multiple sources. First are health data derived from \\ninstitutional registries or census-based data sources. These include, for example, birth and death registries \\ncapturing vital statistics and disease-speci˚c registries, such as those for cancer, tuberculosis and malaria. A \\nsecond source is through health survey data that may be collected periodically Œ for instance, demographic \\nand health surveys. Research data are another major source providing speci˚c information about speci˚c \\ncommunities or disease gradients. The ˚nal category includes a diversity of sources, such as those data from \\nmigration health assessments, health information systems at refugee camp settings, and big data projects \\nsuch as the Global Burden of Disease project.\\n31 A narrative review of migration health data collection practices in Europe revealed that most European \\nUnion countries do not collect data on migrant health in health-care utilization or disease registers, and \\nthose that do use different categorizations and de˚nitions, so that data are not always comparable across \\ncountries.\\n32 Health information systems, surveillance systems and disease registries do not systematically \\ncapture migration variables.\\n33 Migration modules have been tethered in only a few countries undertaking \\ndemographic and health surveys, such as Colombia and Ecuador, which capture data by \\nplace of birth. An \\nexceptional case is that of \\nSweden, which in its annual survey of living conditions includes disaggregated data \\nbased on migration or residence status. People are classi˚ed either as ˚rst- or second-generation migrant, or \\nnon-migrant.\\n34 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n30\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\n32\\n\\n\\n33\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n34\\n\\n221Principles of data protection and ethical considerations are paramount for the collection, analysis, \\ndissemination and linkage of migration health data Œ not only due to historical framing on race, ethnicity and \\nhealth\\n35 and potential for stigmatization, exclusion or, in the case of undocumented migrants, deportation.\\n36 Efforts to capture the extent of migrant integration within health systems, and therefore capture measures \\nof health equity, are exempli˚ed by the Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX) Health Strand project \\n(see text box below). MIPEX Health Strand offers a survey instrument designed to investigate the degree to \\nwhich policies affect migrant health and promote equity, allowing for comparison between different country \\ncontexts.\\n37Migrant Integration Policy Index Health Strand\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the context of health systems, a MHiAP response Œ modelled on the WHO Health in All Policies (HiAP) \\napproach\\n38 and drawing on the MIPEX Health Strand\\n39 Œ aims to engage all the crucial governance actors and \\nsectors involved in the ˚eld of migration and health.

There is a global imbalance \\nbetween the availability of health workers and the burden of disease. For instance, sub-Saharan Africa has \\nthe lowest density of doctors and nurses, and the highest disease burden.\\n40 Well-managed migration of health \\nworkers can play a key role in development overall, as well as in building capacity of health systems, not \\nonly in receiving countries, but also in countries of origin.\\n41 Global health tools such as the WHO Global Code \\nof Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel provide an evidence-based framework to \\npromote good practices and prevent negative effects of health worker migration. As outlined in the WHO \\nGlobal Code of Practice, there are strategies for both sending and destination countries to decrease reliance on \\nforeign-trained health workers and mitigate the negative effects of health personnel migration on the health \\nsystems of developing countries. These may include, for instance: aligning government educational spending \\nwith employment opportunities; not hiring directly from countries with the lowest health-care worker-to-\\npopulation ratios; and adopting innovative ˚nancing mechanisms, allowing local and private entities to \\nprovide complementary funding to government subsidies to health worker training. \\nThe global governance of migration and healthGovernance is central to the development and implementation of any response to migration and health.\\n42 Migration governance rests primarily upon the fulcrum of national sovereignty,\\n43 and ensuring that positive \\nhealth outcomes require well-managed migration. However, there is often limited engagement from health \\nauthorities in high-level migration governance decisions beyond issues concerning global health security \\nŒ including quarantine and border-health management Œ and migration is frequently forgotten in the \\ndevelopment of health programmes.\\n44 Many countries have explicitly stated before international human rights \\nbodies that they cannot, or do not wish to, ensure health protection, including the provision of essential \\nhealth services, to migrants, and especially to irregular migrants.\\n45 A range of governance agendas on the domains of migration and health have developed in recent years, \\nproviding important opportunities for garnering political support for intervention (see ˚gure 2). These \\nagendas bridge the ˚elds of migration governance, development and global health governance, and include: \\nthe Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration; the Global Compact on Refugees; the Sustainable \\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs); UHC; World Health Assembly processes; disease prevention and control programmes \\n(including for malaria, HIV and TB); and the Global Health Security Agenda.\\n46 Effective governance requires \\nstrategic leadership and investment to build alliances between migration management systems and the health \\nsector.\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n43\\n\\n44\\n\\n45\\n46\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n224The SDGs suggest multiple demands to bring the migration, development and health sectors together to \\ndevelop and implement uni˚ed and coordinated responses.\\n47 Target 3.8 of the SDGs calls for universal health \\ncoverage (UHC) Œ a key SDG target providing a strategic opportunity to improve responses to migration and \\nhealth which will, by ensuring the good health of migrant workers and the associated ˜ow of remittances, \\nindirectly bene˚t social and economic development.\\n48 Migrants unaccounted for in UHC programmes are often \\nmissed in discussions about UHC goals at the country level.\\n49\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly \\n\\nGlobal Compact on Refugees \\nSustainable Development Goals\\n(SDGs)World Health Assembly (WHA)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUniversal Health Coverage (UHC) \\nagenda\\n\\nprogrammes (e.g. HIV, TB, Malaria) \\nGlobal health security (GHS) agenda\\n\\ngovernanceﬂ\\nagenda\\nﬁDevelopmentﬂ\\nagenda\\nﬁGlobal Healthﬂ\\nagenda\\nHealth enshrined within 14 \\nencourages \\ngovernments to ﬁincorporate \\nthe health needs of migrants \\n\\nhealth-care policies and plans\\n\\n\\nColombo Ministerial \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n49\\n\\n225The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration Œ discussed in chapter 11 of this report Œ features \\nhealth as a cross-cutting priority with references to health and health-care access in several objectives. Key \\nhealth-related objectives within the Global Compact for Migration with commitments and actions relevant \\nto health are presented in appendix C. A number of experts have commented on weaknesses in the Global \\nCompact in its realization of the right to health of migrants, including its absence on reproductive health and \\naccess to safe maternity care, which directly impacts newborn and child health.\\n50 Despite these limitations, \\nthe Global Compact for Migration does provide the health community the opportunity to use it as a tool to \\nadvance migrant-sensitive health policies and services within discussions on migration governance, where \\nhealth often remains left behind.\\n51 Gaps in migration and health researchGlobally, various research initiatives are underway to assist in developing improved understanding of Œ and \\nresponses to Œ migration and health, with a focus on the implementation of evidence-informed interventions \\nto improve the health and well-being of both migrants and communities affected by migration.\\n52 While this \\n˚eld of research is growing, efforts to improve understanding of migration and health, and examples of \\nmigration and health programming, remain limited.\\n53 As outlined in the text box below, the existing literature \\non international migration and health is limited in scope. It focuses on (a) high-income receiving contexts of \\nEurope and North America; (b) speci˚c health conditions such as mental health, HIV and TB; and (c)\\n speci˚c \\nmigrant groups, including migrant workers, child migrants, unaccompanied minors and ﬁleft-behindﬂ children, \\nwomen, refugees and (female) survivors of human traf˚cking.\\n54 This highlights the need to improve research \\ncapacity in low- and middle-income country contexts, where the majority of migration takes place globally, \\nand to increase the scope of research beyond the current focus on mental health and psychosocial well-\\nbeing. Contextually relevant research agendas need to be set at the national and regional levels, through \\nconsultation with migrant communities, policymakers, practitioners, civil society and researchers. \\n50\\n\\n\\n51\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\n\\n54\\n\\n226Global distribution of international migration and health research in peer-reviewed \\npublications \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\nŁ \\n\\nŁ \\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\nŁ \\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\nŁ \\nSource:\\n \\n\\nNote:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Conclusion: Investing in migration and health to support social and \\neconomic developmentInvestment Œ by way of both ˚nancial and human resources, and political will Œ by States in the development \\nof evidence-informed migration and health interventions will not only address the health needs of individual \\nmigrants, it will also improve public health and support efforts towards achieving UHC. This investment is \\nparticularly important for low- and middle-income country settings, where signi˚cant levels of migration \\ntake place. \\nGood health is a prerequisite for optimizing the bene˚ts of migration (e.g. in the form of remittances); \\ninvestment in migration and health therefore contributes to social and economic development in both \\nmigrant sending and receiving areas.\\n55 Policymakers, civil society, the private sector and researchers all have \\n55\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n227important roles to play Œ globally, regionally and nationally Œ in understanding and responding to migration \\nand health, and migrants themselves must be involved in the development and implementation of policies \\nand programmes.\\n56To achieve this, investment in research capacity is ˚rst needed to improve understanding of the four key \\naspects associated with the ˚eld of migration and health that were outlined in this chapter Œ migrant health, \\npublic health, health systems responses and global governance opportunities. \\nResearch is needed to generate \\nevidence-informed and context-speci˚c interventions to address migration and health, which will, in turn, \\nsupport UHC. Through partnerships with international organizations and academics, a new generation of \\nmigration and health scholars can be supported to develop new research approaches and monitoring systems \\nto improve migration and health responses globally.\\n57 Additional research beyond the current focus on \\nrefugees and asylum seekers, and on mental health and psychosocial well-being, is needed to better inform \\nimprovements in health systems and services. \\nAt the global level, improvements in understanding of the implications of human mobility in order to support \\nand improve public health preparedness planning Œ including developing responses to infectious disease \\noutbreaks or other health emergencies Œ are needed, requiring investment in building research capacity, \\nparticularly in low- and middle-income country contexts.\\n58 Working within the framework of a national \\nmigration and health policy process, the private sector can also support the development of programmes to \\nimprove the health of, for instance, migrant workers. The role of the private sector has been overlooked in the \\ngovernance of migration and health and, among many other innovative roles, this can include sponsorship for \\nbuilding research capacity and interventions designed to address the health needs of migrant workers. Such \\nprogramming will bene˚t the health of both individual migrant workers and their families, both in the origin \\nand destination countries.\\nFrameworks that can provide guidance and indicate strategic opportunities to support migration and health \\ninterventions include: the 2008 World Health Assembly (\\nWHA) resolution ﬁHealth of migrantsﬂ; the 2017 \\nWHA resolution ﬁPromoting the health of refugees and migrantsﬂ; the declarations made at two Global \\nConsultations on Migration and Health; the \\nWHO (draft) Global Action Plan on the Health of Migrants; and the\\n Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which features health as a cross-cutting priority.\\n59 These can be used by academia, United Nations bodies, civil society and government actors to mobilize action, \\nincluding within the private sector. Policymakers Œ with the support of researchers Œ need to identify how \\nboth the migration and health sectors can strengthen their engagement with migration and health through a \\nMHiAP approach. As the integration and inclusion of migrants and migration are a vital component of global \\ndisease control programmes Œ such as those for TB and malaria Œ and global health security agendas, health \\nshould form a key pillar in the development of migration governance. \\nAt regional levels, consultative processes to support the development of coordinated approaches to migration \\nand health are needed. This could be achieved through integrating health into existing regional consultative \\nprocesses on migration and development, and should include collaborations for disease surveillance and \\n56\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n59\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n228interventions to support continuity of care across national borders. To operationalize these suggestions, \\nStates should consider identifying a national focal point that can drive the development of a national \\nmigration and health policy, and lead engagements at regional and global levels. This would require an \\nevidence-informed, intersectoral, participatory approach, the development and adoption of an accountability \\nframework, and centring of global health diplomacy. By investing in evidence-informed interventions, States \\nwill be better equipped to develop responses to migration and health at the local, regional and global levels. \\nThis will have positive impacts on the health of individual migrants, support efforts to achieve UHC by 2030, \\nand Œ ultimately Œ ensure that individuals, communities and States can access the social and economic \\ndevelopment bene˚ts associated with healthy migration.\\n230\\n2318CHILDREN AND UNSAFE MIGRATION\\n1Introduction \\nChild migration is a signi˚cant contemporary phenomenon. It is likely to increase in both scale and salience \\nas the mobility of young people grows, a result of more affordable travel, climate change, growing technology-\\nmediated connectivity, increasing global inequality in the distribution of opportunity, security and access to \\nemployment, and the diffusion of a global cultural commons. \\nLike the migration patterns of other age groups, child migration spans a broad range of phenomena. To start \\nwith the term itself, a child is de˚ned in international law as ﬁevery human being below the age of 18 years, \\nunless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlierﬂ.\\n2 Data on youth migration do not \\nalways use this cut-off point, however, so reference is often made to ﬁyouth migrationﬂ. The broad term \\nﬁmigrationﬂ can cover both international and domestic human mobility Œ movement that is of short duration \\nor lifelong Œ and both one-way and circular journeys. It can span the range from unproblematic family \\nrelocation to traumatic forced displacement caused by the violence of war, attempts at ethnic cleansing \\nor State disintegration. The migration of children includes both journeys where children accompany adult \\nrelatives and situations where children need to undertake journeys alone; it includes situations that result \\nin enduring improvements to the quality of children™s lives, in terms of educational opportunity or familial \\nsecurity, and situations where exposure to exploitation or risk leads to enduring trauma. \\nChild migration is not a new phenomenon, but one that has a history dating back to ancient times. Children, \\nboth boys and girls, have always migrated with or following their families, to pursue opportunities or increase \\ntheir safety away from home. Much of this migration is unproblematic. After a period of adjustment to a new \\ncontext, and with the exception of situations where enduring racial or religious discrimination prevents this, \\nmost children, along with their families, integrate into their new societies. This chapter, however, focuses on \\nchild migration that does not conform to that pattern Œ migration that is unsafe, irregular, exploitative. And \\nit focuses on international migration. This is not to suggest that other aspects related to child migration are \\nnot important. However, the urgent need to better understand \\nunsafe\\n international child migration, in its \\nvarious dimensions, stems from the fact that this aspect of child migration requires greater engagement and \\nsupport from governments and international actors, to ensure children the protection they are entitled to. \\nAccounts abound over the centuries of the unmet protection needs of both male and female children separated \\nfrom their families by wars, famine and environmental disaster; of traf˚cked children transported from home \\nby exploitative masters (slave owners, religious orders, warlords); of unaccompanied children received after \\nforced exile by unfamiliar, even unrelated careers (foster families, refugee agencies, and educational or \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 8 Œ \\n232correctional institutions).\\n3 But, despite this long history, the challenge of protecting the safety and best \\ninterests of migrant children has been neglected. \\nOne reason for recent increased attention to the phenomenon is its current magnitude. As ˚gures 1 and 2 \\nshow, there were 37.9 million migrants under the age of 20 in 2019, 14\\n per cent of the world™s migrants. This \\nreality has urgent implications for educational, child welfare and migration authorities. \\nAnother factor galvanizing increased political will and public concern about child migration is the peculiarly \\nnewsworthy and compelling nature of child suffering. The tragic September 2015 drowning of Alan Kurdi and \\nthe international outrage provoked by the United States Government™s 2018 southern border family separation \\npolicy exemplify this. So does the growing acknowledgement of the life-changing impact of aspects of the \\nmigration process for very large numbers of child migrants.\\n4 Policies that separate parents from their children \\nat borders or through deportation proceedings, as well as protracted administrative procedures that prevent \\nchildren from reunifying with parents for years, can be devastating for the health and well-being of affected \\nchildren.\\n5 Dramatic impacts for children also ˜ow from other migration-related contexts: the absence of \\nlife-saving rescue procedures to pre-empt child drowning or fatal dehydration during migration journeys;\\n 6 educational shortcomings in refugee camps;\\n7 State inaction in the face of evidence of migrant child sexual \\nexploitation;\\n8 and unmet physical and mental health needs for displaced children.\\n9 This chapter examines unsafe international child migration, and the ongoing tension between migration \\ngovernance and child protection imperatives.\\n10 The chapter starts by detailing the different types of child \\nmigration globally, including their drivers, and issues related to the data on child migration. Next, it discusses \\nkey protection challenges affecting child migrants before going on to address current issues and evolving \\npolicies relating to them. The chapter then explores the main emerging challenges confronting child migrants. \\nIt concludes by re˜ecting on achievements and priorities still in need of attention. \\nTypes of child migration\\nDe˚nitional confusion has long bedevilled discussion of child migration. Like the de˚ciencies related to data \\nthat are discussed in what follows, not all aspects of this challenge are speci˚c to children. Facile dichotomies \\nof forced versus economic migration are widely deployed in the migration ˚eld, and complicate the imperative \\nof foregrounding rights considerations for vulnerable populations who may be in urgent need of protection. \\nThe dearth of child migration research from a child- rather than State-centric perspective contributes to \\nthis.\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n233Like adults, children™s migration is not usefully divided into ﬁforcedﬂ or ﬁvoluntaryﬂ, but rather viewed as a \\ncombination of elements of compulsion and choice, which may change over time. Because of the large variety \\nof relevant situations, child migrants are now commonly referred to as ﬁchildren on the moveﬂ, a phrase that \\nhas the advantage of not precluding a transition from one migrant category to another, but the disadvantage \\nof obscuring the challenges arising after settlement. \\nChildren embark on a broad range of different types of migration. Some migration journeys are highly \\ngendered, such as the long-standing exploitative transportation of Nigerian girls to Europe to work in the \\nsex industry, or the self-initiated migration of North African adolescent boys in search of opportunity. Many \\nother migrations, the majority, include both boys and girls, though sometimes in different ratios, depending \\non country of origin. Much child migration, particularly outside the context of con˜ict or disaster, is safe and \\nundertaken as part of a family unit. However, there is an increasing tendency for children to be involved in \\nmigration that jeopardizes their safety and violates their rights. Examples of this type of migration include \\nnot only the obviously life-threatening forced migrations across treacherous routes Œ such as the Eastern \\nand Central Mediterranean, where drownings are frequent Œ but also migrations where children are routinely \\nexposed to physical and/or sexual violence. Unsafe migration also includes situations where children rely on \\nexploitative intermediaries who take advantage of the need for migration assistance to extract labour or other \\ntypes of services from children in their custody. The discussion focuses on these aspects of child migration. \\nChildren may be internal or international migrants. Children whose migration is internal include internally \\ndisplaced persons, seasonal migrants or rural-to-urban migrants.\\n12 Internal migration may be cyclical, and it \\nmay be a prelude to international movement. All three categories comprise large groups of children, some of \\nthem in very precarious situations. \\nInternational child migration includes children who travel for family reasons, for safety or survival, at the \\nbehest of traf˚ckers, for opportunity, and frequently for more than one of those reasons. This chapter focuses \\non unsafe child migration across borders. The following factors are particularly signi˚cant for understanding \\nchildren™s distinctive needs, particularly in relation to safety:\\n(a)  Who is the child travelling with?\\n13 Is he or she accompanied by parents or caregivers (including customary \\ncaregivers), travelling unaccompanied (alone), or travelling separated (in the company of extended \\nfamily members, strangers, traf˚ckers or mere acquaintances)?\\n14 A child might start the migration \\naccompanied and then become separated from family, so that his or her needs change at different stages \\nof the journey.\\n15(b)  Whether or not the child™s migration is authorized\\n (by a visa or other legal provision). Children travelling \\nwithout a regular migration status are at higher risk of exploitation, detention and other harms.\\n16 Again, \\na child™s legal status can change from regular to irregular during migration, as when an asylum claim \\n12\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n234is refused but the child remains in the destination State without legal authorization. The converse is \\nalso true, as when an undocumented child receives a legal status. An example is the procedure in the \\nUnited States, whereby an unaccompanied migrant child who has been abused, abandoned or neglected \\nis granted Special Immigrant Juvenile Status.\\n17 (c)  Whether the child is migrating to escape child-speci˜c persecution\\n, such as recruitment as a child soldier \\nor gang member, child abuse or child marriage. Timely access to legal representation and guardianship is \\na protection priority in this type of migration situation.\\n18(d)  Whether the child is migrating following a family decision\\n or without family knowledge or support. Many \\nmigrants from countries where adult responsibilities vest at an early age exercise their own decision-\\nmaking agency. Afghan males, Eritrean male and female teenagers, and Central American boys and girls \\nare cases in point. Acting like adults, even though classi˚ed as ﬁchildrenﬂ under international law, many \\nseek out opportunities to support themselves or their families by migrating.\\n19 Children in West and \\nCentral Africa also move to pursue religious education, and are entrusted to a religious leader or ˚gure \\nwho is meant to take care of their religious education and well-being, though often for lack of means end \\nup being their exploiter.\\n20 There is no international uniformity about the age when a child™s decision has \\nlegal force. Domestic standards vary, depending on the activity in question.\\n21 Central American children fleeing gangs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n235A self-initiated migration strategy can include entering into relationships with adults who facilitate cross-\\nborder movement in return for services rendered.\\n22 Adolescents also adopt income-generating opportunities, \\nincluding in deeply exploitative situations of labour and sex traf˚cking, to generate resources for migration.\\n23 Because of the absence of legal migration routes, many adolescents eager to exercise their mobility have no \\nsafer alternatives.\\n24 Europol reports that 28\\n per cent of identi˚ed victims of traf˚cking globally are children.\\n25 States have obligations to address these hazardous situations, through robust search-and-rescue operations \\nand livelihood opportunities that might forestall perilous journeys.\\n26 Afghan unaccompanied minor asylum seekers in Sweden\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n236\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc  \\ne \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nData issues in measuring the scale of child migrationTwo propositions about child migration are widely accepted: that the scale of child migration is increasing, \\nand that the data on child migration are incomplete. Figures 1 and 2 give a snapshot of the migration of \\nunder-20-year-olds since 1990. In the absence of data limited to children, these data, which extend from \\n2 years to beyond 18, must be relied on. They draw on census data, one of the most reliable sources, and \\nshow a steady increase in absolute numbers, but a decline in the proportion of under-20s as a share of global \\nmigration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0510152025303540199019952000200520102015201928.427.727.829.831.934.537.9Migrants (millions)Source:\\n \\n237\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0%5%10%15%20%199019952000200520102015201918.617.216.015.614.513.913.9Percentage of migrants under 20Source:\\n \\nConcerns about the inadequacy of data Œ lack of sources and de˚cits in reliable, up-to-date and disaggregated \\ndata Œ are not peculiar to the child migration context; they exist for the migration ˚eld as a whole, and \\nare referenced throughout this report. But the data de˚ciencies regarding child migrants are of particular \\nconcern, because they hamper timely and adequate protection and care for a group of migrants that may \\nbe especially vulnerable and dependent on government support. Remarkably, only 56\\n per cent of refugee-\\nrelated data and 20\\n per cent of internally displaced person (IDP)-related data include age-disaggregated \\ninformation; even migrant stock data include information about age in only 80\\n per cent of countries.\\n27 The \\nabsence of age disaggregation is not the only concern. Others include broad gaps in data on gender, problems \\nrelating to the double-counting of children who move between and within countries, and de˚cient methods \\nfor ascertaining age.\\n28 The most recent global estimate for the total number of child migrants is approximately 31 million.\\n29 This is \\na ﬁstockﬂ ˚gure, one that represents the total number of people under 18 born in a country other than the \\none where they are living. Though it gives a snapshot of the magnitude of the issue, it is of limited accuracy \\nand use, because it does not describe which country the migrant children have come from, what their legal \\nstatus is, how long they have been where they are or what the children™s date of birth is. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n238An additional complexity arises from the technical fact that a child, in international law, is de˚ned as ﬁany \\nhuman being below the age of 18ﬂ, whereas census data are based on the age groups 0Œ4, 5Œ9, 10Œ14 and 15Œ\\n19 years of age; the global ˚gure just cited is based on a United Nations Children™s Fund (UNICEF) estimation \\nof the size of the last of these groups, which applies to people under 18.\\n30 To this ˚gure can be added others. \\nUNICEF has calculated Œ using United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and United Nations \\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs (UN\\n DESA) data, combined with evidence from the United Nations \\nRelief and Works Agency and Eurostat Œ that approximately one in eight migrants is a child, the majority of \\nthem being regular migrants who travel with a regular status and the necessary protection. However, large \\nnumbers do not enjoy that safety. There are approximately 13 million child refugees, 936,000 asylum-seeking \\nchildren, and 17 million children who have been forcibly displaced inside their own countries.\\n31 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n199019952000200520102015201919901995200020052010201520191990199520002005201020152019051015199019952000200520102015201920152019201520191990199520002005201019901995200020052010051015Source:\\n \\n30\\n\\n\\n31\\n239\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0%10%20%30%0%10%20%30%\\n\\n199019952000200520102015201919901995200020052010201520191990199520002005201020152019199019952000200520102015201920152019201520191990199520002005201019901995200020052010\\nSource:\\n \\nThese regional stock data graphs complement the global picture presented earlier, in ˚gures 1 and 2. They \\nshow that some regions (most dramatically, Asia) have experienced a sharp increase in the numbers of young \\nmigrants. They also highlight large differences between the regions in the proportions of children within \\ntheir migrant stocks Œ nearly 30\\n per cent in Africa, compared with less than 10\\n per cent in Europe and North \\nAmerica. \\nIn addition to these sources, there is also a proliferation in the availability of new data mining techniques that \\nhave the potential to generate better information in the future. They include geospatial mapping, satellite \\nnightlights and analysis of changing smartphone location in real time. A word of caution is in order, however. \\nThe proliferation of and access to personal information, including biometric indicators, may generate risks \\nrather than protections for child migrants. So more rather than less data should not be a goal in and of itself, \\nunless privacy protections and other ethical concerns are carefully attended to. In particular, due diligence in \\nthe implementation of ﬁ˚rewallsﬂ to prevent the use of personal data for punitive or immigration enforcement \\ngoals is an essential correlate of ethical and rights-based data collection.\\n32 32\\n\\n\\n\\n240Data on vulnerable populations, such as displaced child migrants, are particularly useful when they are \\nspeci˚c and have the potential to contribute to policy challenges. One example is the following details on \\nthe distribution of young Rohingya refugees in Cox™s Bazar, Bangladesh, where over 50\\n per cent of the child \\npopulation is still out of school.

The contrast in age distribution between Rohingya \\nand Venezuelan refugee populations in these ˚gures is noteworthy. It illustrates signi˚cant differences in the \\nage composition of the populations prior to their forced migration, with Rohingya estimated to have had one \\nof the highest birth rates of all ethnic groups in Myanmar.\\n33There are also likely to be differences related to the nature of the displacement events. For the Rohingya, \\nlethal ethnic violence prompted entire communities to ˜ee for survival in a short period. For the Venezuelans, \\neconomic crisis and ongoing instability initially compelled adults of working age to move in search of \\nalternative sources of income to support families left behind. However, over time, this has become a more \\npervasive displacement situation as the crisis has deepened and whole families, including children, have \\nmoved. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaleFemale\\n0Œ56Œ1112Œ1718Œ5960+20%0%20%Age groupSource:\\n \\nNote:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n33\\n\\n242Key child protection challenges affecting child migrantsLarge-scale child migration inevitably places complex demands on States, obligated as they are to address \\nneeds and provide services as required by international and domestic legal standards. Following are some of \\nthe key current challenges concerning child migration. \\nEducation \\nStates are mandated to provide education to all children in their jurisdiction without discrimination.\\n34 For any migrant child, few State services are more important. Not only does education generate portable \\nindividual skills and capital that impact central aspects of the life course, it also provides the context for \\nsocial inclusion, peer group encounters and new cultural and language acquisition. Many examples exist of \\ninnovative educational provision directed at generating robust multicultural environments responsive to \\ndifferent pedagogic and emotional needs.\\n35 This is a context where scarce resources and a perception that outsiders are being privileged can generate acute \\nresentment towards newcomers, unless investment also targets domestic populations in need.\\n36 Challenges \\nalso arise in identifying accurately the needs of migrant or refugee children, taking account of their prior \\neducational experience and their linguistic competencies.\\n37 Bangladesh: Rohingya children™s access to education\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n34\\n\\n35\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\n243\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuardianshipWhereas some State services, such as education, are essential for all migrant children, others only apply to \\nsome. A case in point is the need for appointment of a guardian responsible for the child™s care where children \\nare unaccompanied or separated, or otherwise at risk, a measure called for by both international and regional \\npolicies on child migration. Only a minority of States have incorporated this recommendation into their \\ndomestic legal obligations. Among them is Italy (see text box below).\\nItaly™s protection measures for unaccompanied minors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n244Several acute child protection challenges have emerged where unaccompanied minors outside family care or \\nany institutional framework providing shelter have set up home in informal unauthorized camps created by \\nrefugees and migrants, often as a prelude to further migration to join family members elsewhere. \\nCurrent issues and evolving policies \\nWhile the majority of children who migrate do so through safe migration processes as part of family units, \\nmany other child migrants do not. Some continue to lack effective protection from harm and face sustained \\nhuman rights violations at all stages of their journeys, in the country of origin at departure, en route through \\ntransit regions and seas, on arrival at their temporary or permanent destination and, with growing frequency, \\nin the country to which they are returned if their migration journey is curtailed. \\nMany agencies have called attention to this substantial protection de˚cit, highlighting urgent challenges.\\n38 Of \\nimmediate concern as key priorities are the risk of exploitation and abuse, the negative impact of detention, \\nthe effect of family separation, the inadequate access to education and health care, the lack of attention to \\ndrivers of forced child migration and, ˚nally, discrimination. To these urgent issues could be added others \\nconfronting millions of child migrants. One is the absence of adequate legal pathways for the exercise of \\nchild and youth mobility, a shortcoming of the contemporary migration framework that renders so much \\nchild migration unsafe. Another is the pervasive and underaddressed stigma surrounding undocumented \\nchild migrants, whatever their length of residence at destination. Yet another concern relates to the absence \\nof safety and child protection guarantees in asylum seeker and refugee camps or shelters. Finally, there are \\nserious de˚cits in access to guardianship and legal representation for unaccompanied and separated child \\nmigrants.\\n39 International initiatives to improve protection of child migrants\\nAlongside these continuing challenges, one ˚nds a rich body of recent international work, setting out principles \\nand implementing policies that improve the circumstances surrounding child migration. At the international \\nlevel, there have been a number of developments regarding child migration. A landmark document is the \\ninternational synthesis of rights relevant to child migrants set out in the United Nations Committee on the \\nRights of the Child 2005 \\nGeneral Comment No. 6 (2005): Treatment of Unaccompanied and Separated Children \\nOutside their Country of Origin\\n.40 The General Comment was followed by a second important international \\neffort regarding child migration, the 2012 Committee on the Rights of the Child \\nReport of the 2012 Day of \\nGeneral Discussion: The Rights of All Children in the Context of International Migration\\n.41 A practical outcome of \\nthe Day of General Discussion was the creation of an Inter-Agency Group on Children on the Move focused on \\nmainstreaming child protection concerns into the migration agenda. The group produced a widely endorsed \\nset of recommended principles for child migrants targeting some of the key enduring protection challenges.\\n42 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\n\\n41\\n42\\n245Most recently, other initiatives have built on the conclusions and principles of the initiatives just described, \\nas well as the inter-agency position on migrant and refugee children for the two compacts and the work of the \\nInter-Agency Working Group to end Child Immigration Detention.\\n43 Two United Nations treaty bodies adopted \\nadditional General Comments on the topic of child migration in 2017 and consolidated their efforts into the \\n˚rst Joint General Comment on the subject in the same year, namely the \\nJoint General Comment No. 3 (2017) \\nof the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and \\nNo.\\n 22 (2017) of the Committee on the Rights of the Child on the General Principles regarding the Human Rights \\nof Children in the Context of International Migration\\n.44 The Joint General Comment also stresses the importance \\nof according relevant State authorities Œ whether of origin, transit, destination or return Œ a leading role, \\nﬁwith clear decision-making powerﬂ, on policies and practices pertinent to migration-affected children.\\n45 Central among such practices are the conduct of best interests assessments and determinations, individualized \\nprocedures that need to be conducted by trained and accountable personnel, where appropriate at different \\nstages of the decision-making procedure. UNICEF consolidated much of this policy work by releasing a ﬁsix \\npoint plan to keep refugee and migrant children safeﬂ in 2017.\\n46 Together these initiatives have created a useful action framework for States. By highlighting needs for \\nspecially targeted protection measures Œ including access to free legal representation, integrated services \\nincluding in relation to education, and to protections from exploitation and trauma Œ these frameworks have \\ngiven a welcome impetus to policy reform. They have stimulated measures that take note not just of the \\nvulnerability and dependence, but also the resilience and agency of young migrants, including States™ duties \\nto ﬁprepare and accompany children through the journey to adulthood, rather than threatening them with \\nabrupt change as soon as they reach the age of maturityﬂ.\\n47 However, effective implementation of these recommendations has been mixed. All the documents just \\nreferenced stress the imperative to issue birth registration and concomitant proof of identity for all children \\nin the territory, because these documents provide critical tools for reducing statelessness, exploitation and \\nabuse of child migrants, and for increasing access to State facilities such as health care and education.\\n48 But \\nmany groups of migrant and refugee children continue to lack these documents. They include Syrians born in \\nexile, and Rohingya in Myanmar and abroad.\\n49 Integration of migrant children outside of family care within the national childcare or child protection \\nagency is still not the norm. Research has identi˚ed a policy and practice gap in the protection and support \\napparatus related to the transition to adulthood, with obvious implications for both mental health and well-\\nbeing.\\n50 There are, however, some examples of good practice, such as Italy and Turkey.\\n51 43\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n44\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n45\\n46\\n\\n\\n\\n49\\n50\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n246European States have made considerable, if uneven, progress in instituting access to legal representation for \\nunaccompanied and separated children, and in reducing the reliance on detention, but this is not the case in \\nother jurisdictions, such as the United States.\\n52 Much of the agenda laid out by these normative frameworks remains to be implemented. Several recent \\nmass forced exoduses of children have demonstrated the dearth of services available. Mental health needs \\namong millions of displaced Syrian children are acute and mainly unattended to; educational needs among \\nRohingya refugee children in Bangladesh are challenging and not fully met, particularly for the older cohorts \\nof children.\\n53 Another area where the gap between normative exhortation and implementation is evident \\nis protection of migrant children following repatriation. Returned children rarely encounter reintegration \\nassistance, or the rehabilitative services called for by standard-setting initiatives.\\n54 Regional initiatives to improve protection of child migrantsSeveral signi˚cant regional initiatives on child migration have been developed in recent years. Three are \\nnoteworthy Œ those in the European Union, in West Africa and in Latin America Œ and are discussed in turn \\nbelow.\\nThe European\\n Union has witnessed large-scale ˜ows of child migrants in recent years. In 2015, for example, \\n31 per cent of the refugees arriving in the European\\n Union by sea were children, and in early 2016 the \\nproportion of children among sea arrivals in Greece was up to approximately 40\\n per cent.\\n55 European \\ninstitutions have been at the forefront of some of the most impactful policy and practice advances in respect \\nof migrant and refugee children.\\nThe European Court of Human Rights has played an important if cautious role, providing a critical forum \\nof last instance for particularly egregious State behaviour.\\n56 It has prohibited the placement of asylum-\\nseeking children (including where accompanied by their parents) in reception conditions likely to generate \\nﬁa situation of stress and anxiety, with particularly traumatic consequencesﬂ, an all-too common occurrence, \\nparticularly in Southern Europe;\\n57 it has ruled against the detention of migrant children, even for short \\nperiods, where alternative and less restrictive strategies should have been considered, or where the detention \\nconditions, when in˜icted on children, whether in terms of length of time in custody or level of provision \\nwithin the institution, amount to inhuman or degrading treatment;\\n58 and it has, albeit in a limited fashion, \\nprevented family expulsions with far-reaching consequences for the care or well-being of affected children.\\n59 European Union measures are also noteworthy. On 12 April 2017, the European Commission adopted a \\nﬁCommunication on the protection of children in migrationﬂ,\\n articulating a comprehensive programme of \\nprotective action for child migrants at all stages of their migration.\\n60 52\\n\\n\\n53\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n55\\n\\n56\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n59 \\n\\n\\n60\\n\\n247But adequate or integrated responses to this ambitious programme are still elusive. ﬁReconciling child \\nprotection and migration control goals, already dif˚cult at national level, may become all the more dif˚cult \\nacross borders. In practice transnational cooperation frequently focuses ˚rst and foremost on which State \\nshould have the child within its jurisdiction, rather than centring on a proper joint assessment of the best \\ninterests of the childﬂ.\\n61 Integration across all European Union member States in respect of child protection \\nobligations has not been effective so far.\\n62 West Africa is another region with a well-established system of cross-border free movement of persons, \\npromoted in part by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a regional grouping of 15 \\nWest African States founded in 1975. The region has a long tradition of mobility, driven by a range of factors, \\nincluding economic self-improvement, environmental hardship, con˜ict and escape from abuse of harmful \\ntraditional practices (including early marriage and witchcraft). Rates of child migration are high: a 2016 \\nUNICEF report notes that 1 in 45 children in the world today are on the move, with Africa home to 1 in 5 of \\nthese child migrants.\\n63 In this region, most migration is intraregional, and children travel as much as adults, \\nmany of them unaccompanied or separated, often considered de facto adults with attendant responsibilities. \\nWhile some of this child movement is self-initiated and generative of opportunities and life enhancements, \\na signi˚cant portion is coerced or abusive, and places child migrants in situations of high risk and scarce \\nprotection.\\n64 Child protection implementation for migrants has lagged far behind norm-setting standards. Domestic social \\nand child protection structures are minimal, and transnational mechanisms are practically non-existent.\\n65 By \\ncontrast with the European Union, ECOWAS has not promulgated any coordinated protective transnational \\nmeasures for child migrants. Early protective efforts in the region, taking note of widespread child traf˚cking, \\nresulted in misplaced efforts to stop child migration, described by experts as ﬁan attempt to pour water \\nuphillﬂ, as most intercepted and returned children embarked on migration again within weeks.\\n66 From 2005 onwards, ECOWAS has collaborated with partners in the region in forming the West African Network \\n(WAN), speci˚cally geared to generating protective interventions and effective referral mechanisms for the \\nbene˚t of child migrants in the region, particularly those travelling unaccompanied. WAN reports delivering \\nassistance to over 6,500 child migrants since its inception.\\n67 WAN™s work has included early identi˚cation of \\nvulnerable child migrants and provision of emergency support where needed, as well as the consistent use of \\nbest interests assessments, which consider alternatives to migration, family and community support measures \\nto assist reintegration where appropriate.\\n68 A third region where child migration has been the focus of multi-State attention is Latin America. Among \\nvarious regional initiatives, the most notable is the Inter-American Court of Human Rights 2014 Advisory \\nOpinion on the needs of children in international migration.\\n69 The opinion draws attention to the urgent \\n61\\n62\\n\\n\\n\\n63\\n64\\n\\n65\\n\\n66\\n\\n\\n\\n69\\n\\n248and unmet need for international protection, and describes applicable procedures relevant to the treatment \\nof both asylum-seeking and irregular child migrants, highlighting principles such as the non-detention of \\nchildren based on an irregular migratory situation. Mexico has taken a lead in implementing protective \\nservices for unaccompanied child migrants, including those returned by the United States. Measures to \\ndecrease the reliance of detention are being considered (see the text box below on recent progress). \\nTwo examples of recent progress in protecting child migrants \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n249Emerging issuesAt its important convening in September 2016, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) issued a \\nlandmark statement, the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, announcing the launch of two \\nnon-binding Global Compact processes, one for refugees and one on migration.\\n70 It stated: ﬁWe will protect \\nthe human rights and fundamental freedoms of all refugee and migrant children, regardless of their status, \\nand giving primary consideration at all times to the best interests of the child. This will apply particularly to \\nunaccompanied children and those separated from their familiesﬂ.\\n71A central goal of the Global Compact for Migration is to advance the important Sustainable Development \\nGoal (SDG) on migration. This SDG, identi˚ed as SDG Target 10.7, calls on States to ﬁfacilitate orderly, safe, \\nand responsible migration and mobility of people, including through implementation of planned and well-\\nmanaged migration policiesﬂ.\\n72 The Initiative for Child Rights in the Global Compacts, a multi-stakeholder effort to highlight child migrant \\nissues, identi˚ed several priority areas for making SDG Target 10.7 a reality for children. Among them is \\nthe meticulous generation of accurate, targeted and disaggregated empirical data to anchor the process of \\nevaluating compliance with the Global Compact for Migration™s child migrant protection goals. \\nAn emerging child migration issue is the growing political heft of an organized movement of child migrants \\nthemselves. In the spring and summer of 2017, a group of young Afghan migrants led protests in Sweden™s \\ncapital Stockholm against the Government™s threat to deport them back to Afghanistan, culminating in a \\n1,000-person-strong demonstration in the city centre.\\n73 The protests were successful, forcing the Government \\nto withdraw deportation notices issued to some of the unaccompanied Afghan asylum seekers whose claims \\nfor protection had been denied. Another instance is the United States-based ﬁDreamersﬂ organization, a group \\nof young migrant activists who have embarked on ﬁa gesture of civil disobedience that de˚ed immigration \\nenforcement policies and sought to re-shape legislation on citizenshipﬂ.\\n74 A very large constituency of children \\nand young people, many of them United States residents since infancy, this group has succeeded in bringing to \\npublic attention the compelling merits of their case for legalization. Deeply affected in all areas of their lives \\nby their irregular migration status, the group has organized public events drawing attention to the pervasive \\nconsequences of being undocumented.\\n75 Broader alliances demanding legalization for undocumented youths \\nhave also developed, including United We Dream, a national youth-led advocacy network that brings together \\nover 50 af˚liates. The future of the so-called ﬁDACA-mentedﬂ youths Œ those who have bene˚ted from former \\nPresident Obama™s ﬁDeferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA)ﬂ executive order deferring deportation \\nand permitting employment for 800,000 eligible undocumented children and young people Œ remains deeply \\nuncertain. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n250Deportation and forced removal of unaccompanied child migrants and refugees is an issue of growing concern.\\n76 This large-scale repatriation process, a consequence of vigorous regional border enforcement policies, \\nparticularly in Europe and North America, externalizes the protective responsibilities owed child migrants to \\njurisdictions poorly able to shoulder them. Human rights organizations have drawn attention to signi˚cant \\nchild protection concerns related to these policies, including the absence of any systematic scrutiny of the \\nbest interests of children or the likely risks back home.\\n77 In 2017, UNICEF reported that 9\\n per cent of the \\nestimated 400,000 migrants stranded in Libya were children, 14,000 of them unaccompanied.\\n78 By May 2018, \\nAmnesty International reported the existence of over 33 active detention centres in Libya with over 7,000 \\nmigrants (many of them children) detained in them. In the absence of relocation opportunities in Europe or \\nelsewhere, the European Union, the African Union and United Nations agencies have directed their efforts to \\nthe repatriation of migrants wishing to exit from the detention facilities and return home. IOM has facilitated \\nthe return of over 23,000 migrants from Libya, including a small number of children. Efforts are being made \\nto ensure that assessments of the best interests of repatriated children are conducted prior to return, and to \\naddress the lack of support to returnees or their families once they arrive in the country of return.\\n79 A ˚nal emerging issue, and one that may dwarf the others, is the growing impact of climate-related mobility \\non the lives of children and their families (see chapter 9 of this report). In addition to the general issues, a \\nfew child-speci˚c points arise. Children rarely make decisions about how or when to move in climate-related \\nmobility contexts, nor are they generally involved in any way in the programming of such moves. This \\nparticipation failure can exacerbate the feeling of disorientation and loss associated with forced uprooting \\nfrom one™s home, one™s peer group and one™s anchoring sense of belonging. \\nConclusionThe focus of this chapter has been on the subset of international child migrations that generate protection \\nconcerns, migrations that require greater public engagement and support. \\nIncreased attention to the scale and modalities of contemporary child migration has generated policy reforms, \\nseveral of them detailed above, that are beginning to result in improved protections for child migrants and \\nrefugees. For example, many countries to which large numbers of unaccompanied children have migrated \\nhave instituted guardianship schemes and free legal representation services. And indeed, even where policy \\nimplementation is still incomplete or inconsistent, there is a growing consensus about minimum standards \\nthat should apply to child migrants. Thus, it is widely accepted that child migrants should not be subject to \\ndetention, that the agency, participation and resilience of child migrants should be attended to as much as \\ntheir vulnerability and dependence, that migrant and refugee children should be mainstreamed into domestic \\neducational and child protection services, and that unaccompanied and separated children should be the \\nfocus of dedicated measures. Both early childhood development and adolescent child welfare experts are \\ngradually including the special considerations relevant to child and refugee migrants in their programing and \\ntraining.\\n80\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n251However, considerable implementation gaps remain, illustrated by recent incidents described above, such \\nas family separation and child migrant detention in the United States, and the need to expand educational \\nprovision for Rohingya refugee children in Bangladesh. Very large numbers of forcibly displaced children, both \\ninside the borders of their own countries and in camps adjacent to them, continue to lack access to basic \\nservices such as primary health care and education, and to experience repeated threats to their physical and \\nmental well-being. Exploitation and exposure to violence en route remain common incidents of contemporary \\nchild migration. Overall, the imperative of attending to the needs and rights of child migrants, and of \\ndeveloping a child-centric approach to research and planning, is still imperfectly realized, and data that are \\nnecessary to demonstrate the urgency of this situation remain inadequate.\\nThis chapter has pointed to several hopeful developments, including the more vigorous engagement of a \\nrange of actors in the improvement of child migrant protection, the production of useful guidelines for policy \\ndevelopment, the growing intersectoral convergence of professionals working with child migrants, and the \\nincreasing activism and leadership developing within the child migrant community itself. \\nFinally, it bears repeating that serious protection challenges remain, challenges that are likely to persist \\nunless concerted steps are taken to counter some worrying trends. Among them, most critical perhaps, is \\nthe persistent evidence of violence targeting migrant communities including young migrants, whether in the \\ncourse of their journeys or on arrival in their new host countries. Children who have survived the challenges \\nof life in refugee camps or perilous border crossings need inclusive measures, stability and opportunity if \\nthey are to overcome the searing legacy of the past. For those who enjoy the bene˚ts of supportive familial \\nor community settings, this may well ensue, provided their societies engage actively with the prevention of \\nxenophobic aggression and the diffusion of hate Œ in the classroom, football ˚eld or housing complex. For \\nthose child migrants who have travelled alone, more may be necessary to ensure resilience, to ensure that \\ntheir voices are heard, and to support their prospects of success. Child welfare and migration governance \\nsystems need to converge and build the capacity to collaborate with greater consistency, to facilitate the \\ninclusion of migrant children into domestic child protection structures, to incentivize greater knowledge of \\nand understanding towards children™s needs and rights in the migration system, and to thoroughly implement \\nnon-discrimination obligations in respect of all migrant children within the jurisdictions. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKOKO WARNER\\n253\\n\\n\\n\\nKOKO WARNER\\n9HUMAN MOBILITY AND ADAPTATION TO \\nENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE\\n1Introduction \\nMillions of men, women and children around the world move in anticipation or as a response to environmental \\nstress every year. Disruptions such as cyclones, ˜oods and wild˚res destroy homes and assets, and contribute \\nto the displacement of people. Slow-onset processes Œ such as sea-level rise changes in rainfall patterns \\nand droughts Œ contribute to pressures on livelihoods, and access to food and water, that can contribute to \\ndecisions to move away in search of more tenable living conditions. Advances in meteorological and other \\nsciences which inform about the dynamics and pace of climate change indicate that disruptions ranging from \\nextreme weather events to large scale changes in ecosystems are occurring at a pace and intensity unlike \\nany other known period of time on Earth.\\n2 Anthropogenic climate change is expected to increasingly affect \\nmigration and other forms of people moving to manage these changing risks.\\n3 This chapter provides an up-to-date overview of environmental change and the spectrum of human mobility. \\nIt ˚rst explores different perspectives on environmental change and migration, ranging from the view that \\nhuman mobility including migration is a security issue, that it is an issue of protection, and that it is a \\nmatter of adaptation and managing risks associated with environmental change. The chapter then provides \\nexamples of environmental migration from empirical research around the world. It then summarizes recent \\ndevelopments in the international policy sphere on the topic. The conclusion draws out the implications for \\nresearch, policy and practice. \\nUnderstanding the links between environmental change and migration \\nThe mechanisms through which environmental impacts contribute to migration are complex.\\n4 Over the last \\ndecade, it has become accepted that links between the environment and migration are rarely linear. Some \\nliterature frames the issue as a normal and neutral social process and other articles refer to the ﬁmigrancy \\nproblematicﬂ.\\n5 Economic, political, cultural and demographic factors interact with environmental drivers to \\nshape intentions of people to move or stay in a given location. These interactions can contribute to building \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 9 Œ \\n254pressure Œ sometimes referred to as tipping points Œ after which remaining in situ becomes less attractive \\nthan leaving.\\n6 Whether and when these intentions are manifested into actions is partially dependent on the \\nmaterial ability to move,\\n7 with some immobile populations labelled as ﬁtrappedﬂ.\\n8 Immobility is not necessarily \\nrelated to material conditions, and also relates to psychological and cultural limitations and preferences.\\n9 Numerous terms have been used to describe people who move as a result of environmental and climate \\nchange. This chapter uses terms such as ﬁhuman mobilityﬂ in the context of climate change, which refers \\nto a broad spectrum of people movement. It covers migration, displacement and planned relocation, as well \\nas ﬁenvironmental migrantsﬂ, including in relation to extreme events and other environmental stressors. \\nThree main framings of environmental migration and human mobility in the context of climate change \\nhave emerged in academia, the media and in policy circles: (a) irregular migration related to environmental \\nchange and resource shortages as a border security issue, particularly for areas of destination; (b) protection \\nof environmental migrants; and (c) environmental migration as a form of adaptation and climate risk \\nmanagement (see table 1), re˜ecting the political sensitivities of migration. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n255\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ˚rst type of framing tends to emphasize environmental migrants as part of a wider ﬁthreat multiplierﬂ \\nlandscape as either explicitly or implicitly a threat to security in areas of destination,\\n10 and has been argued \\nas being related to a focus on national borders and resource control.\\n11 In policy, these ideas can translate into \\nborder security discussions and measures. The second framing tends to represent environmental migration as \\na phenomenon associated with vulnerable people moving in adverse circumstances and who need protection. \\nProtection approaches share commonalities with approaches that highlight human rights related to rights \\nto work, education, health care, food and water, and other rights that environmental shocks can disrupt. \\nProtection approaches place the needs of the affected people who may be moving at the centre. The protection \\nframing is evident in the work of the Platform on Disaster Displacement.\\n12 The securitization and protection framings have been critiqued as they have not suf˚ciently acknowledged \\nthe agency of the people affected by environmental change, emphasizing threats without fully acknowledging \\nopportunities that may also play a role in environmental migration. The third type of framing views human \\nmobility ranging from migration, displacement, and planned relocation as a set of possible adaptive responses \\nto climate impacts and risks. In climate policy, human mobility appeared for the ˚rst time in the Cancun \\nAdaptation Framework and currently features in a dedicated workstream on human mobility as well as the \\nTask Force on Displacement. This framing recognizes the possibility of reducing exposure and vulnerability \\nto physical disruptions associated with climate and other environmental stressors.\\n13 It also emphasizes the \\npursuit of approaches to avert, minimize and address displacement related to the adverse effects of climate \\nchange. The following section brie˜y sets out the evolution of the framing of migration as a form of adaptation. \\n10\\n11\\n\\n\\n12\\n13\\n\\n256Understanding migration as a possible response to climate impacts \\nand risksThough outcomes are context speci˚c, some understanding has emerged over the last decade of the \\nopportunities migration presents in the face of environmental disruptions.\\n14 When voluntary migration is \\nconsidered, people may be able to protect or use their assets and health, decide on who in the household \\nmoves and how, as well as when and where they will go. In this manner, migration is part of a suite of \\nadaptation measures, which people use to deal with climatic and environmental change and reduce poverty \\nand boost resilience.\\n15 Where households are more resilient, younger, better-educated migrants improve \\nthe condition of the household through remittances used to pay for education, health care or livelihood \\ndiversi˚cation. Where households are in a more precarious position, migrants might be the household heads \\nand outcomes can be described as surviving through securing food, or cash to acquire food.\\n16 The distinction \\nbetween voluntary and forced migration is somewhat arbitrary and has been described as more accurately \\nresembling a continuum from entirely voluntary to entirely forced.\\n17 In responding to environmental issues, \\neven ﬁvoluntaryﬂ migration can involve some degree of pressure. Supportive policies and legal pathways \\ntherefore act as an enabling factor for migration in these situations, with the effect of facilitating safe, \\norderly and regular migration that is better able to be managed.\\nOnce adaptation possibilities (both in situ and ex situ strategies) and community resilience have been \\nexhausted, an entire community may have to relocate as a last resort.\\n18 The resulting change in circumstances \\nmeans that the consequences of the move could be considered adaptive under certain circumstances. In the \\ncase of planned relocation, outcomes may be adaptive if processes are participatory and include acceptance \\namong both areas of origin and areas of destination from an early stage, and when suitable livelihood \\nopportunities are available for people who may move.\\n19Critiques and nuances \\nThe questions of framing environmental migration and human mobility in the context of climate change \\nas part of a threat multiplier (security) discourse, as a protection framework issue, and as an issue of risk \\nmanagement has a signi˚cant subjective element. Migration has been explained as a failure to adapt or a \\nstrategy of last resort.\\n20 The ﬂenvironmental refugeeﬂ literature that emerged further reinforced this framing \\nwhich depicted the prospect of climate change causing large-scale movements to urban areas and from \\ndeveloping to developed countries.\\n21 The term ﬁadaptationﬂ has been critiqued as some uses emphasize the \\nrole of individuals and households over responsibility to the political and economic structures that foster \\n14\\n\\n15\\n16\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\n257vulnerability.\\n22 The concept of migration as adaptation has been challenged as ignoring political economic \\nrealities,\\n23 and some literature claims that the migration as adaptation framing obscures the discourse about \\nclimate change and migration along ethnic and racial lines.\\n24 The emphasis of positive outcomes in the \\nmigration as adaptation framing has been criticized by some scholars as not re˜ective of migrants™ realities.\\n25 Further, planned relocation processes have proven to be complex, and can also affect the relationship between \\ngovernments and subnational jurisdictions in urban and rural areas, so are sometimes not considered as \\nadaptation to climate change.\\n26Moving may reduce vulnerability in the short-term, but contribute to further problems in the medium-term, \\nas populations may recreate exposed and vulnerable conditions in new sites.\\n27 Migration for work may help \\nmigrant-sending households to manage environmental shocks and stressors in the short-term. However, it \\ncould expose migrant workers, and thereby migrant-sending households, to shocks and stressors in the \\nmedium- or long-term.\\n28 Consideration of the ﬁwhoﬂ and ﬁwhenﬂ of adaptation reveals that adaptation is \\nexperienced subjectively; in the last decade there has been an increase in research which highlights the \\nsubjective nature of climate risk,\\n29 and subjective barriers to both climate change adaptation and potentially \\nadaptive migration.\\n30Data and knowledge on environmental mobility\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n22\\n23\\n\\n\\n24\\n25\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\n258Evidence of migration and environmental changeThe following section presents examples of migration and environmental change drawn from around the \\nworld. It builds on the three ecological zones identi˚ed in the Foresight Report (i.e. mountainous, dryland \\nand coastal) which face disruption related to climate change.\\n31 The examples address a variety of adaptive \\nresponses to these environmental disruptions, ranging from migration for work to diversify income to national \\npolicy to promote anticipatory forms of migration (table 2). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPeru\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMountainsA diverse range of human migration pathways in the context of environmental change have been documented \\nin mountainous regions: displacement, labour migration, planned relocation and transhumance.\\n32 Changes \\nin climate adversely affect transhumant movements between summer and winter pastures of herders in \\nhigh mountains.\\n33 Herders in Afghanistan, Nepal and Pakistan perceive negative changes in vegetation \\ncomposition as a result of erratic snowfall patterns and a decrease of rainfall.\\n34 Livestock deaths due to heavy \\nsnowfall and water scarcity in traditional water sources along migration routes have been reported across \\n31\\n\\n32\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n33\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n259the Hindu Kush Himalayan region.\\n35 At the same time, an increase in temperature, with its effects on snow \\ncover, have had some positive impacts such as an early start of seasonal migration from winter to summer \\npastures and lengthening of residence in summer pasture.\\n36 Pastoral communities also face complications from \\nother factors which interact with climate change, such as con˜ict with sedentary communities, institutional \\nbarriers, market forces and inadequate policy support.\\n37 Different adaptation measures have been adopted \\nby pastoral communities to manage environmental shocks and stressors. In the Himalayan region, herders \\nhave incorporated changes in their movement (such as shifting grazing areas, change in routes and reducing \\nthe length of stay at different locations on the route), and in a few cases have relocated families or entire \\nvillages. Herders have also adopted in situ measures such as stall-feeding animals, changing types of livestock, \\ntemporary ban on livestock sale, and digging ponds to store water.\\n38 Migration for work, particularly circular and seasonal migration, is a traditional strategy of mountain people \\nto manage the risks posed by environmental hazards to farming and livestock rearing. Transitioning from \\nfarm-based income to labour migration and associated remittances was one of the ways in which communities \\nin Naryn River Basin in Kyrgyzstan, particularly those located in the downstream region, responded to changes \\nin water supply.\\n39 Remittances ˚nance relief during disasters and support recovery and reconstruction in their \\naftermath. Migrants and diaspora in the United States of America were actively involved in sending money \\nto support their families and relief efforts after the 2015 earthquake in Nepal.\\n40 The extent of remittances™ \\npositive or negative impacts on recipient households and origin communities varies from one context to \\nanother.\\n41 For example, the effect of remittances on vulnerability to extreme weather events is non-linear. \\nRemittance-recipient households in drought affected rural communities in South-west China have less \\nadaptive capacity than non-recipient households. However, remittance-recipient households that received \\nremittances over longer periods were found to have improved adaptive capacity.\\n42 In Tajikistan, families \\nhave a high dependency on migrant remittances and also largely lack understanding of possible adaptation \\nresponses that lower their capacity to adapt to environmental and climate stressors.\\n43In many mountain regions, migration for work is a gendered process. Women left behind bear the responsibility \\nof taking care of children and the elderly, managing household assets and responding to new challenges.\\n44 Factors such as social and cultural norms, access to information and institutional issues act as barriers to \\nadaptation for women.\\n45 In Nepal remittance-recipient households are more likely to invest a part of their \\nsavings in ˜ood preparedness if women left behind have access to capacity-building interventions that aim to \\nstrengthen autonomous adaptation measures such as precautionary savings and ˜ood preparedness.\\n46 35\\n\\n\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n39\\n\\n40\\n41\\n\\n42\\n\\n43\\n\\n44\\n\\n45\\n\\n\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\n260Drylands \\nIn drylands around the world, environmental change is increasingly contributing to human migration.\\n47 In \\nparticular, changes in rainfall are contributing to pressures on livelihoods, including those supported by \\nagriculture, pastoralism and ˜sheries. These factors have a potentially serious and dif˜cult-to-predict impact \\non different ethnic groups. For example, insuf˜cient information exists about indigenous communities in \\nAustralia, their responses and the way that local knowledge may contribute to different forms of adaptation, \\nincluding migration.\\n48 In Central America, a signi˜cant relationship has been found between changes in \\nrainfall in dry Mexican states and human ˚ows to the United States.\\n49 Other authors have highlighted the \\nrelationships between food security, migration and violence in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.\\n50 There is evidence of diaspora investment into dryland areas. In the Senegal River Valley, migration is related \\nto environmental change and water extraction.\\n51 The new mosques and schools that have been built in the \\nPodor Department in the Senegal River Valley are illustrations of diaspora funding to contribute to community \\nresilience and development.\\n52 A joint project of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the \\nUnited Nations Convention to Combat Deserti˜cation was successful in encouraging investment by diaspora \\ncommunities in sending areas of Burkina Faso, the Niger and Senegal. This money was used for investments \\nin sustainable land management and to formalize networks between communities in Milan, Italy, and areas \\nof origin.\\n53 Movements from the Senegal River Basin to Saint-Louis, in part driven by drought and water extraction in the \\nlast quarter of the twentieth century may have seemed adaptive initially. But, after the end of a dry cycle, \\nnewly settled areas of the city, which were previously subject to ˚ash ˚oods, were once more inundated.\\n54 One \\nresponse to this risk has been the creation of an early warning mobile app through which users are informed \\nof likely ˚ood risks when mobile signals are attenuated due to atmospheric water.\\n55 This shows the need to \\nconsider the combination of slow- and rapid-onset hazards. Migration from densely populated areas to more \\nsparsely populated agricultural frontiers in Dagara, Ghana, contributed to reducing the pressure on the land \\nin sending areas and resulted in increased remittances which facilitated the purchase of bullock and ploughs. \\nOn the other hand, it also facilitated the continuance of potentially unsustainable agricultural practices in \\nsending areas.\\n56 International movements related to environmental change may increase due to reduced costs \\nand development of (regular and irregular) routes and of networks to support cross-border movements.\\n57 47 Rigaud et al., 2018.\\n48 Carson et al., 2014.\\n49 Nawrotzki, Riosmena and Hunter, 2013.\\n50 IOM and WFP, 2016; IABD et al., 2017.\\n51 Madgwick et al., 2017.\\n52 Ibid.53 IOM, 2014; IOM and UNCCD, 2019.\\n54 Diagne, 2007.55 Ouedraogo et al., 2018.\\n56 Van der Geest, 2011.\\n57 Donato and Massey, 2016. \\n261Slow-onset processes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\nCoastal areas and islandsHistorically, migration has been a way of life in many islands around the world, and these processes are \\naccelerating under the in˜uence of a changing climate.\\n58 Coastal and island communities face increasing \\nexposure to the impacts of tropical storms and sea-level rise.\\n59 In addition, many coastal regions and islands \\nare adversely impacted by a shortage of freshwater sources, compounded by changes in rainfall patterns and \\nsalinization caused by ˜ooding.\\n60 The prospect of disappearing land, islands and freshwater poses serious \\nchallenges and a range of human mobility patterns are emerging in this context, including a range of solutions \\nto protect the well-being of those moving.\\n61 In Paci˚c small island developing States (SIDS), research has shown that migration (related to anticipated \\nclimate impacts) results in remittances, more opportunities for younger people and is complementary to other \\nadaptive measures.\\n62 Because migration is not an option available to all, moving and ˜ows of remittances can \\nrecreate or enhance vulnerabilities and inequalities, as was the case in Tonga.\\n63 Coastal ˚shing communities \\ncan have their homes and livelihoods affected by climate change. Declining ˚sh populations and biodiversity \\nrelated to over˚shing and increased sea temperatures have forced artisanal ˚shers in Senegal to ˚sh further \\nout in sea or seek work as ˚shing labourers. Some ˚shers could fund building homes away from the encroaching \\nocean with the money they had made from international migration.\\n64 Deltaic regions provide fertile land and access to water for irrigation, ˚sheries and trade.

Often it \\nis the young who move and the remittances they send can contribute to the development of new livelihoods \\nand enterprise facilitated through the purchase of a water pump.\\n66 Perceptions of adaptive mobility in the Marshall Islands\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nﬁIf more people leave there will be less people and more jobs open then my husband will \\nbe able to ˜nd a job.ﬂ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nﬁBy going abroad for a short time this can prevent the migrant or the person moving from losing his or her lands and housesﬂ.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nﬁI disagree because I see Marshallese on Facebook singing Marshallese songs and dancing Marshallese dances.ﬂ \\n\\n\\nIn Haiti, the ﬁMigration, Environment and Climate Change: Evidence for Policyﬂ (MECLEP) project found \\nthat seasonal migration might have a bene˚cial impact on household vulnerability.\\n67 Accordingly, the new \\nmigration policy of Haiti developed within the project recognizes the positive outcomes of migration and how \\nit can lead to adaptation through the transfer of skills, money and knowledge. Migration has been integrated \\ninto urban development, adaptation and disaster risk reduction programmes. Questions related to migration \\nand environmental change have now been added to the census.\\n68 65\\n66\\n\\n\\n\\n263Relocation of some coastal and island communities has begun. One study projects that over 400 towns, \\nvillages and cities in the United States, including a large number of coastal indigenous communities, will \\nneed to relocate by the end of the century as a result of environmental change.\\n69 Isle de Jean Charles in \\nLouisiana will be the ˚rst community to receive federal funds and support for relocation. Residents have \\nworked with local non-governmental organizations to plan a new sustainable community and settlement \\nusing modern technology and innovative use of wetlands and parklands to protect against ˜ooding while \\nmaintaining ˚shing livelihoods. A signi˚cant challenge will be to incorporate the history, traditions and \\nculture of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe.\\n70 The full involvement of affected communities in decision-\\nmaking on matters including access to resources, where the new settlement will be sited and when and how \\nthe project develops plays an important role in community relocation.\\n71Migration with dignity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nc \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ne\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n69\\n\\n264Urban areas \\nWhile it is important to consider areas of origin, it is also vital to analyse areas of destination when assessing \\nthe outcomes of environmental migration. For example, after three years of drought in Mexico, increased \\n˜ows of people from rural to urban areas have been documented.\\n72 Such movements can be adaptive or \\nmaladaptive. Cities are often situated in areas prone to hazards, such as on the low-lying coastal areas or in \\nareas of geological hazards, such as landslides, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In cases where-migrants \\nsettle in areas exposed to hazards, such as in slums on hillsides or in ˜ood-prone regions, these populations \\nmay be more exposed and vulnerable to environmental and climatic disruptions in the future. It is possible \\nthat more environmental hotspots will emerge in the future with a population subject to a triple jeopardy of \\npopulation growth, increased vulnerability and exposure to more severe and frequent and climate events.\\n73 Urban settings can magnify the differences in the experiences of women and men, highlighting the gendered \\naspects of migration and environmental disruption. Women are considered to be more vulnerable than \\nmen before, during and after moving, with implications for their safety and security, psychological needs \\nand access to services and property rights.\\n74 Migration in the wake of disasters can also increase risks of \\ntraf˚cking.\\n75 However, migration, and even displacement, can also bring opportunities for women. In the \\nPhilippines, women took on roles as camp managers in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan.\\n76 Women leaving \\nenvironmentally marginal areas in Bangladesh have the potential to ˚nd employment in the Dhaka garment \\nindustry where they are perceived favourably by potential employers in comparison to men. Women must \\nweigh bene˚ts of being able to send remittances to sustain families against possible stigma of migration. \\nThese factors make women less likely to move in the context of environmental impacts.\\n77 Minority migrant groups in urban settings are most affected by risks to critical infrastructure.\\n78 They are \\noften portrayed as a vulnerable group in the face of a hazard (see chapter 10 of this report). However, \\nrecent research has shown that linguistic minority immigrants and refugees might be resilient because of \\nthe challenges they have experienced in the past.\\n79 For example, urban residents who have left Paci˚c SIDS, \\nwhere they experienced ˜oods and cyclones, were better placed to cope with new urban risks in destination, \\nsuch as the Wellington earthquake.\\n80States are beginning to plan for resilient and transformative settlements. Kenya™s National Adaptation Plan \\nexplicitly mentions that climate change places a strain on urban infrastructure. The Plan states that droughts \\ndrive urbanization which places people Œ especially vulnerable groups such as children, persons with disabilities \\nand the aged Œ in marginal lands prone to ˜ooding. It therefore recognizes the need for climate-resilient urban \\ndevelopment.\\n81 In Bangladesh, State actors are planning to encourage people to move to climate-resilient and \\nmigrant-friendly urban centres. These urban areas need to be developed through a combination of bottom-up \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n265participatory processes to address the local needs and contexts and top-down planning and support.\\n82 This \\nconcept ˚ts into Bangladesh™s Seventh Five Year Plan, which focuses on ﬁtransformative adaptationﬂ.\\n83 Policy frameworks \\nAs outlined in chapter 11 of this report, there have been substantial developments in global migration \\ngovernance in recent years. However, an overarching framework has not yet fully emerged to provide policy \\nguidance where human mobility and environmental stressors, including climate change, intersect. A number \\nof different global governance mechanisms exist, having emerged in different contexts and with varying \\nemphasis on the mobility aspects of climate change. The chapter brie˜y describes two key mechanisms that \\nseek to address environmental change, migration and aspects of adaptation and climate risk management: \\nthe United Nations Framework Climate Change Convention™s climate negotiations and the recently adopted \\nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Beyond the Global Compact for Migration, there are, \\nhowever, much more international considerations of, and policy approaches to, this highly topical issue. A \\nsummary of international policy aspects beyond these two mechanisms is outlined in appendix A.\\nGlobal climate change negotiations and human mobility \\nHuman mobility Œ migration, displacement and planned relocation Œ has been framed as an issue of climate \\nrisk management under the UNFCCC, particularly in the work conducted under the adaptation and loss and \\ndamage work streams. The framing of risk management has evolved between the 13th Conference of the \\nParties (COP13) in 2007 and the 24th Conference of the Parties (COP24) in 2018.

Invites all Parties to enhance action on adaptation under the Cancun Adaptation \\nFramework – by undertaking, inter alia, the following: – (f) Measures to enhance \\nunderstanding, coordination and cooperation with regard to climate change induced displacement, migration and planned relocation, where appropriate, at national, regional and international levelsIn 2013, at COP19, Parties to the UNFCCC established the Warsaw International Mechanism to explore \\narrangements to manage residual risks, including those related to human mobility.\\n85 Ongoing work under the \\nUNFCCC process, including the Warsaw International Mechanism, aims to bolster the capacity of countries \\nto make risk-informed decisions about pre-emptive activities, planning, and contingency arrangements that \\naffect where and how people live.\\nAt COP21, a turning point occurred when the Paris Agreement established a Task Force on Displacement under \\nthe Warsaw International Mechanism, mandated to develop recommendations for integrated approaches to \\navert, minimize and address displacement related to the adverse effects of climate change.\\n86 The Task Force is \\ncomprised of States, technical experts from different groups under the UNFCCC, United Nations organizations \\nand representatives from civil society. The Task Force produced comprehensive recommendations that touched \\nupon the whole human mobility spectrum, such as encouraging countries to integrate climate change and \\nmigration concerns when formulating national laws, policies and strategies, and supporting the facilitation of \\nregular and safe migration pathways.\\n87 In parallel, the Warsaw\\n  International Mechanism also endorsed a ˚ve-\\nyear work programme where one work stream relates to migration, displacement and human mobility.\\n88 COP24 adopted the Task Force on Displacement recommendations in 2018 and extended the Task Force mandate \\nfor another two years.\\n89 The text box below summarizes the types of recommendations addressed to countries, \\nUnited Nations agencies and stakeholders.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n267UNFCCC Task Force on Displacement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCountries:Ł \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\nŁ \\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnited Nations agencies and stakeholders:Ł \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGlobal Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration \\nAhead of deliberations on the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, the United Nations \\nAgenda for Sustainable Development made mention of migration, although the connection between migration \\nand the environment was not explicitly stated. That said, the Agenda for Sustainable Development and its \\nrelated goals for 2030 have paved the way for linking migration and the environment in future frameworks. Of \\nparticular note is the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which is a legally non-binding \\nagreement by States that is directly linked to target 10.7 of the Agenda for Sustainable Development:\\n26810.7 Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, \\nincluding through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies.The Global Compact for Migration sets out 23 objectives in a comprehensive approach to optimize the bene˚ts \\nof migration while addressing its risks and challenges, including those relating to climate stressors and \\ndisaster. The Global Compact states that migration is ﬁa source of prosperity, innovation and sustainable \\ndevelopmentﬂ.\\n90 Nonetheless, when environmental migration is mentioned, it is mainly presented in the \\ncontext of vulnerability as opposed to bene˚cial outcomes. Four objectives of the Global Compact for \\nMigration are especially relevant to climate and disaster risks. In particular, Objective 2 is about minimizing \\nthe adverse drivers that compel people to move and includes a standalone section dedicated to climate change \\nand disasters. In that respect, the text recognizes that\\n climate change adaptation and resilience measures\\n in \\ncountries of origin need to be prioritized to minimize the adverse drivers of migration. However, the text also \\nacknowledges that adaptation in situ or return of migrants might not be possible in some cases and mentions \\nthe need to consider planned relocation and visa options (Objective 5 on enhancing availability and ˜exibility \\nof pathways for regular migration). Objective 7 of the Global Compact for Migration aims to address and \\nreduce vulnerabilities in migration. Finally, Objective 23 commits to international and regional cooperation \\nin the context of disasters. \\nOverall, the Global Compact for Migration articulates\\n a comprehensive set of potential responses to address \\nthe adverse drivers of migration and make migration a choice rather than a desperate necessity. However, \\ndue to the non-legally binding nature of the Compact, some States may decide to only take limited action to \\naddress environmental migration challenges. \\nConclusionThis chapter has provided an overview of three prominent framings of environmental migration and human \\nmobility in the context of climate change: securitization, protection, and adaptation and climate risk \\nmanagement. The chapter has also highlighted existing evidence of patterns of human movements Œ ranging \\nfrom migration, displacement and planned relocation Œ in different settings, principally mountainous areas, \\ndrylands, coastal zones and urban areas. This evidence illustrates some of the trade-offs people make as they \\nweigh the realities and potential risks of staying or moving away in the face of environmental and climate \\nstress. It has also highlighted the relevance of context, as it relates to environmental settings but also how \\ndifferent communities are able to demonstrate resilience as well as adaptive capacities. \\nThe chapter has also reviewed two key mechanisms in international policy where discussions about \\nenvironmental migration and human mobility in the context of climate change are taking place (with \\nadditional material in the appendix). There has been growing recognition in recent years of the need to \\nbetter integrate migration into global climate and environmental mechanisms, and for climate change \\nmechanisms to incorporate human mobility aspects. Signi˚cant steps have been taken to ensure that the \\nissue of human mobility in the context of environment and climate change receives greater consideration \\nat the international level. And yet, its inherent sensitivities Œ as re˜ected, for example, in the different \\nframings discussed above Œ means that there is still more work to be done in the development of cohesive \\n90\\n\\n\\n\\n269policy approaches. Nevertheless, the ultimate success of these frameworks and guidelines relies on the degree \\nto which recommendations are implemented by States and other actors through migration, development, risk \\nand environmental policies in addition to mainstreaming into other programming. \\nIn conclusion, climate science suggests that the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events are \\nrising, exposing more people and their assets to adverse impacts. The places people currently live and work in \\nare under increasing pressure from environmental and climate change. Migration, displacement and planned \\nrelocation are capturing increased attention from research, policy and practice as people attempt to move \\naway from stress and risk, and towards safety or opportunity. In this context, measures are needed with the \\nfollowing characteristics: \\nŁ people are enabled to choose whether, when, and with whom to move (existing networks and digni˚ed \\noptions appropriate to cultural contexts and preferences); \\nŁ people who move can access livelihood opportunities and remit resources that enhance adaptation; and \\nŁ people who move can do so in a digni˚ed, safe and regular manner. \\nThe literature and cases examined in this chapter indicate a need for research, policy and practice on which \\nadaptive options can help people move towards well-being even in the face of growing environmental and \\nclimate risks.\\nThe importance of environmental, climate change and disaster drivers will continue to be a key area for future \\nresearch and policy developments in the international migration governance debate. The reality of how slow \\nand sudden-onset hazards impact people™s livelihoods and in˜uence their migration strategies, as much as the \\nsigni˚cance of the political questions around migration and climate change issues will continue to position \\nenvironmental migration at the forefront of these debates.\\n270\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n27110MIGRANTS CAUGHT IN CRISES: CONTEXTS, \\nRESPONSES AND INNOVATION\\n1Introduction \\nThe situations of people who have moved from their countries of origin only to ˚nd themselves caught \\nin a crisis that threatens their security and ability to thrive are of growing concern to the international \\ncommunity. While crises affect both nationals and non-nationals, the ability of migrants to cope with their \\nimpacts may be reduced, due to conditions of vulnerability associated with migrants™ legal, economic and \\nsocial status, as well as practical challenges, such as linguistic differences, geographic displacement and \\neven cultural context, which can limit access to timely and understandable information, services, resources \\nand safety. While not all migrants are equally affected in times of crisis, they are often among the most \\nvulnerable, at increased risk and in need of speci˚c support.\\n2 Addressing the needs of migrants living in places affected by crisis has become a priority of policy forums \\nat both global and regional levels. Recent initiatives and policy processes include regional dialogues on \\nmigration in Africa, the Americas, and Central and South-East Asia; the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \\nReduction 2015Œ2030; the Paris Agreement; and the World Humanitarian Summit. The Migrants in Countries \\nin Crisis (MICIC) Initiative and the development of the set of Guidelines to Protect Migrants in Countries \\nExperiencing Con˜ict or Natural Disaster\\n3 provide concrete examples of efforts to improve current practice.\\n4 The situation of migrants in crisis contexts is also acknowledged in the 2018 Global Compact for Safe, Orderly \\nand Regular Migration, where it is highlighted as an essential element for the achievement of objective 2 on \\nminimizing the drivers of forced migration, and objective 7 on reducing migrants™ vulnerability.\\nDespite the existence of relevant policies, questions remain on the effectiveness of current efforts to address \\nmigrants™ vulnerability and support their capacity before, during and after crises. This is due, in part, to \\nthe fact that, although there is growing recognition at regional and global levels of the need to respond \\nto the particular situation of migrants in crisis contexts, the needs and safety of migrant populations may \\nnot be a priority for affected countries. Moreover, in some cases, migrant-speci˚c crisis response measures \\nhave focused primarily on returning migrants to their countries of origin. While evacuations or returns may \\nin some instances be the only life-saving option for migrants caught in crisis contexts, this focus can come \\nat the expense of other effective support mechanisms that may better meet migrants™ immediate post-crisis \\nrecovery and longer-term interests and needs.\\n5 Ensuring appropriate responses requires a clear understanding \\nof migrants™ interests and priorities across different geographical and sociopolitical contexts. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 10 Œ \\n272Re˜ecting these concerns, this chapter focuses on the experiences of migrants in crisis contexts, and the \\nlocal, national and international responses to address their conditions and needs. This is important for \\nthree main reasons: (a) to better understand the ways in which migrants are affected by situations of crisis \\nthat occur in the countries in which they live or through which they are travelling; (b) to re˜ect on the \\neffectiveness of efforts that focus on the needs of migrants in crisis contexts; and (c) to identify the ways \\nin which actions by a range of stakeholders involved in any crisis situation can ensure that the needs and \\ninterests of migrants are taken into account.\\nThe chapter is organized into four sections: (a) the next section draws on the framework provided by the \\nMICIC Initiative to examine the varying contexts, responses, gaps and lessons learned in crisis preparedness, \\nemergency response and post-crisis recovery; (b) the section that follows provides an overview of existing \\ndata on migrants in countries at risk of or affected by crisis, and assesses data needs and gaps; (c) innovative \\nresponses for supporting migrants caught in crises are discussed in the section that follows; and (d) the ˚nal, \\nconcluding section re˜ects on policy and practice implications. \\nGuidelines to Protect Migrants in Countries Experiencing Conflict or National \\nDisaster\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCRISIS PREPARDNESSEMERGENCY RESPONSEIncorporate migrants \\nin preparedness and \\nemergency response \\nsystems\\nEstablish clear referral \\nprocedures\\nEvacuate and \\nrelocate migrants \\nwhen neededInvolve migrants\\nin contingency \\nplanningEstablish migrant-sensitive \\ncommunication mechanisms Support migrants™ \\nrecovery\\nEstablish coordination \\nagreements\\nSupport the recovery of host \\ncommunitiesBuild capacity for emergency \\nresponse and \\nrecovery\\nProvide timely and \\naccurate information \\non accessing assistanceFacilitate \\nmigrants™ \\nmovement \\nto safety\\nEmpower \\nmigrants \\nto help themselves\\nProvide \\nassistance without discrimination˜89234567˜0˜4˜3˜2˜˜˜5POST-CRISIS ACTION\\nCollect and share \\ninformation \\non migrants\\nTrack \\ninformation \\non crises273Key contexts and crisis phasesCrises Œ de˚ned as situations ﬁin which there is a widespread threat to life, physical safety, health or basic \\nsubsistence which is beyond the coping capacity of individuals and the communities in which they resideﬂ\\n6 Œ are associated with a wide range of phenomena. They can be triggered by environmental hazards, con˜icts \\nand terrorism, as well as complex emergencies, failures of political and economic management, epidemics and \\npandemics, and global ˚nancial cycles. \\nIn recent years, ˜ooding in Bangladesh and Thailand, major hurricanes in North America, con˜icts in Libya \\nand Yemen, as well as political and economic crisis in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, have created the \\nneed for emergency assistance and urgent protection of migrants. Each of these places hosted migrants prior \\nto and during the crisis, including permanent residents, temporary workers, business travellers, tourists and \\nstudents, as well as asylum seekers and refugees. \\nThe issue of migrant vulnerability in crisis contexts has been brought to the attention of the international \\ncommunity following large humanitarian emergencies. Lower-intensity (but often higher-frequency) events Œ \\nsuch as urban ˚res and accidents, localized landslides and episodes of violence Œ can also disproportionately \\naffect migrants, who may be living in areas more susceptible to these hazards. Experience from all crisis \\nevents shows that patterns of marginalization and exclusion increase migrants™ vulnerability to most hazards. \\nDifferent crises, whether large- or small-scale, affect migrants in different ways (see appendix A), and will \\nresult in different operational interventions or actions. \\nTaking specific operational contexts into account: The example of health crises \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMigrants may experience greater obstacles accessing protection and support, particularly where an individual \\nhas limited social networks. Depending on the circumstances, numerous other factors (such as gender, age, \\nrace and ethnicity, sexual orientation or disability status) compound vulnerability and the ability to cope \\nin crisis contexts. At the same time, and as discussed in this chapter, migrant and local capacities before, \\nduring and after crises can inform and strengthen response beyond a vulnerabilities-centric approach, to one \\ngeared to understanding migrant capabilities. Recognizing the diversity of migrant pro˚les and supporting \\nmigrants to respond to crises are essential to reducing risks. Migrants may ˚nd themselves facing situations \\nin which they are more vulnerable or more empowered. When the 2011 Brisbane ˜oods occurred in Australia, \\n\\n\\n\\n274for instance, the role of culturally and linguistically diverse community leaders in immigrant and refugee \\ncommunities was essential, as they acted as gatekeepers and communicated emergency responses to the \\ndisaster to their communities.\\n7 While in Thailand, restrictions on mobility stemming from administrative \\nbarriers limited the mobility of many migrant workers affected by ˜oods, who had to choose between staying \\nin ˜ooded, risky areas or face possible loss of legal status, arrest and deportation.\\n8 Coordination, planning, and preparedness \\nEffective coordination, planning and preparedness require clear identi˚cation of the roles of various \\nstakeholders. This begins with the fundamental obligation of States under international human rights law to \\nprotect the life and dignity of everyone Œ both citizens and non-citizens Œ living within their borders. \\nCountries of origin most often respond to the needs of their nationals caught in crises abroad through \\nconsular assistance. The rights and responsibilities of consular services to exercise their consular prerogatives \\nin times of crises are delineated in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (1963). In practice, however, \\nthe ability of States to act effectively in these contexts depends on resources, capacity, political will, effective \\nplanning and preparation. \\nThe right to consular protection\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeyond consulates, other institutions in migrants™ countries of origin can provide support in crisis contexts. \\nFor instance, the Government of the Philippines has integrated measures to protect its nationals abroad in its \\npolicies, institutional structures and mandates, which may directly and indirectly support migrants caught in \\ncrisis.\\n9 Key to the country™s system is the Overseas Preparedness and Response Team, established in 2011 and \\ncomprising representatives of several ministries. The team™s objective is to develop preparedness strategies \\naimed at supporting Filipinos abroad, including destination-speci˚c contingency plans in case of crisis, to \\nbe updated every six months.\\n10 This is complemented by a variety of programmes and services that aim to \\nsupport the ability of migrants to address challenges they may face. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n275Philippine consular support for migrant workers caught in conflict\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere States cannot respond effectively, international organizations have sometimes stepped in to ˚ll gaps \\nand support the implementation of support mechanisms for migrants. This was seen most clearly in Libya \\nduring the con˜ict that broke out in 2011. Between 1.5 million and 3 million migrants, mostly from sub-\\nSaharan Africa, were estimated to be living in the country at the time of the civil war,\\n11 and most were unable \\nto access services provided by Libyan or home country authorities when the con˜ict escalated, as there were \\nno contingency plans for migrants. Bordering countries promptly opened their borders to migrants escaping \\nLibya, and non-governmental and international organizations also supported relief efforts, notably in the \\nform of international evacuations to home or third countries.\\n12 Coordination of these operations was initially \\ndeveloped on an ad hoc basis. In March 2011, IOM and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \\n(UNHCR) coordinated evacuation efforts and set up the Humanitarian Evacuation Cell. This Cell sought to \\nsupport the management and use of assets and in-kind contributions received from 19 countries for the \\nevacuation of migrants, totalling an estimated USD\\n 23 million, and was supported by the European Union \\n(EU) Monitoring and Information Centre, which assisted in transmitting requests for assets and in collecting \\noffers from EU member States. The ad hoc nature of these operations highlighted the need for stronger \\npreparedness mechanisms to manage large-scale international evacuations out of crisis areas.\\nCivil society organizations (CSOs) are also key service providers in crisis contexts, often acting as a bridge \\nbetween migrant communities and State actors.\\n13 During the 2006 war in Lebanon, for instance, CSOs \\nsupported migrant domestic workers, forming a consortium to work with the Lebanese Government to address \\nthe needs of this group. CSOs made the case for better cooperation and coordination with intergovernmental \\norganizations and State actors, which were their main allies during the crisis.\\n14 In the United States, civil \\nsociety efforts such as the California Farm Worker CARE Coalition have also played a role in ensuring that \\nmigrant workers had access to information and support during the California wild˚res (see box below). \\n11\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n14\\n\\n\\n276California Farm Worker CARE Coalition: Civil society coordination\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\nEmergency responses and lessons learned \\nThe effectiveness of responses is to a large extent dependent on the preparedness of key stakeholders, and their \\nability to include and coordinate plans with migrant communities. Regardless of the level of preparedness, \\nmany crises require ˜exibility, ad hoc arrangements and quick decision-making. The availability of and rapid \\naccess to crisis funding, information and ˜exible migration policies can signi˚cantly affect the effectiveness \\nof response efforts targeting migrant populations. \\nResponses to the needs of migrants in the contexts of large humanitarian crises have mostly been ˚nanced \\nthrough traditional funding streams. Evidence from past crises suggests that these can be narrowly or politically \\nfocused. In the 2011 Libyan context, for instance, there is evidence that funding was used primarily for \\nevacuation and returns to home countries, rather than on supporting those migrants who wished to remain, \\nor providing options to stay in safe third countries.\\n15 Moreover, these traditional funding streams may be \\ndif˚cult to access, or slow to activate, signi˚cantly impacting on the lives and well-being of migrants. Again, \\nthere is evidence that administrative and bureaucratic obstacles delayed and limited the timeliness of support \\noperations during the crisis in Libya. By November 2011, IOM had formally received USD\\n 111 million from donors \\nand USD 23 million in in-kind donations.\\n16 At the height of evacuation operations, up to USD\\n 4 million were \\nrequired every day to charter planes to destinations as far away as Bangladesh or Viet Nam.\\n17 Administrative \\nissues delayed access to the funding and, in turn, evacuations.\\n18 Following the experience of large-scale \\nmigrant evacuations in response to the Libya crisis, IOM set up a Migration Emergency Funding Mechanism, \\nwith Member States™ support, to cover the cost of international transport for migrants affected by crisis. The \\npurpose of the fund is to jump-start the emergency response while waiting for donor funding to be received, \\nin order to avoid the delays similar to those experienced during the evacuations from Libya. \\nThere have been efforts by international organizations such as the World Bank and IOM to improve direct \\ncash assistance. In 2011, the World Bank granted a loan of USD 72 million to the Government of Bangladesh \\n15\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n277to repatriate and provide transitional assistance to over 36,000 Bangladeshi migrant workers who escaped the \\ncrisis in Libya.\\n19 The assistance was provided directly to returnees, through a one-time cash grant to cover \\nimmediate basic needs and partial expenses associated with the initial restoration of livelihoods.\\n20 At the national level, India has established Community Welfare Funds, which levy small fees from consular \\nservices to support Indian nationals caught in crisis or other emergency situations abroad.\\n21 These funds \\nallow consulates to have rapid access to resources in emergency cases, which in turn allows for the launch \\nof rapid responses.\\n22 This has been further strengthened through the institutionalization of State capacity \\nto repatriate nationals in times of need. In addition to emergency response services such as repatriation, \\nthe funds can fund a range of support services aimed at addressing migrant vulnerability and capabilities, \\nincluding providing boarding and lodging for migrants in need, emergency medical care and provision of legal \\nassistance.\\n23New avenues for cooperation could usefully be developed between the private sector and other non-traditional \\nactors, including diaspora populations, providing material support, communications resources, translation or \\nshelter to migrants in crisis contexts.\\n24 The role of private sector actors in supporting migrant resilience and \\ntheir capacity to face crisis effectively was highlighted during the MICIC Initiative™s consultations.\\n25 In 2016, \\nIOM moved forward with private sector partnerships, including partnerships with media or partners within \\nthe technology sector working on effective information sharing.\\n26 Such partnerships may serve as models for \\nbetter integration of community and private sector actors in backing or initiating activities that may directly \\nor indirectly better support migrants™ capacity to handle a crisis. Research is needed to ensure that best \\npractices are successfully identi˚ed and adapted to speci˚c contexts. Diaspora populations may also have an \\nimportant role to play in improving emergency response capacity and coordination, notably through their \\nprovision of more reactive funding streams.\\n27 Access to services, information and social networks is also critical in times of crisis, for ensuring migrant \\nsafety and decision-making. However, access to information for migrants can be challenging, and is often \\nhampered by a failure to take account of migrants in emergency communication plans, as well as their limited \\nlanguage skills, local knowledge and lack of opportunity of access to local social networks. \\nThis problem could be seen during the 2011 ˜oods in Thailand. Emergency services in Thailand were informed \\nby census data that was unable to adequately capture a large population of migrants with irregular status.\\n28 In addition, limitations on migrant worker movement, as well as con˜icting information from the Government \\nconcerning support to migrants, was a source of confusion and uncertainty for migrants and national aid \\nworkers.\\n29 Migrants™ awareness, access to knowledge and preparedness for the ˜oods thus depended on their \\nlevel of integration in their host society, especially their ability to speak and understand Thai.\\n3019\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n30\\n\\n278The existence of migrant groups and community networks can mitigate the negative impacts of a crisis. \\nThis can be seen, for example, in the case of Japan during the 2011 earthquake. Prior to the earthquake, \\nthe Bayanihan Kesennuma Filipino Community collective was already an active group, bringing together \\nFilipino women living in Kesennuma (mostly married to Japanese men), who provided guidance and support \\nto newcomers. The strength of these existing networks meant that the group was able to ascertain the status \\nand safety of families and individuals during the earthquake, provide information to the Embassy of the \\nPhilippines, and support response actions and aid distribution.\\n31 In addition, there is clear evidence that migration status can also have a signi˚cant impact on the ability \\nof migrants to deal with crisis, and that ˜exible immigration and visa policies enable migrants to both keep \\nthemselves safe in times of crisis and more easily recover from its impact. For example, the Government of \\nTunisia led the way in allowing the movement of migrants and other affected persons out of Libya in 2011. \\nThousands of migrants who were unable to return to their countries of origin were assisted by Tunisian \\ninstitutions, civil society and the population, with the Tunisian Red Crescent playing a central role.\\n32 Similarly, \\nthe Government of Djibouti has played a key role in facilitating the evacuation of migrants trapped in Yemen \\nen route to Gulf States during the con˜ict.\\n33 Moreover, ˜exibility of visa and work permit policies can ensure \\nthat migrants who have lost documents are able to renew them. \\nPost-crisis actions: Reintegration and reconstructionPolicy revisions and re˜ections after a crisis ensure that lessons are learned and can enhance response \\ncapacity and preparedness. The MICIC Initiative itself re˜ected a growing global concern to address the \\nsituation of migrants in times of crisis. \\nA critical gap in post-crisis action concerns the support that is provided to returnees and host communities. \\nAlthough repatriation is common in many crisis scenarios, returns can challenge the absorption capacity and \\nresilience of households, communities and societies in the country of origin. It is notable that no long-term \\npositive examples of reintegration were identi˚ed during the review undertaken for this chapter. Indeed, \\nmost literature points out that migrants often receive little or no long-term assistance after being returned \\nto their countries following a crisis.\\n34 The majority of reintegration efforts Œ where they existed Œ were \\nshort-lived, with longer-term crisis responses hindered by lack of funding and the absence of future-oriented \\nperspectives.\\n35 The failure to institute effective reintegration structures raises important questions about the extent to \\nwhich it is appropriate to focus on return when addressing the needs of migrants in countries facing crisis. \\nReturns are often a highly visible sign of action, but they are also expensive and politically sensitive. Returns \\nŒ if combined with a long-term reintegration strategy, and made to a location where conditions are safe and \\namenable to the pursuit of a digni˚ed life Œ can be appropriate. However, returns may also render migrants \\nconsiderably worse off. For instance, Cameroonians and Chadians who were working in the Central African \\n31\\n32\\n\\n33\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n35\\n279Republic in 2012 were mainly self-employed business people working in trade, and generally better off than \\nthe average local population. Most returned to their countries of origin because of the 2012 crisis, funded \\nby donor States. However, the return and reintegration support that was available was often lacking. The \\nreturnees who had previously found success working in urban areas in the Central African Republic were \\nfrustrated to ˚nd themselves in rural surroundings upon return. When assistance to returnees dried up due \\nto donor interests shifting to the insurgency in the Lake Chad region and resulting displacement, Chad was \\nunable to continue to support returnees, and the reintegration support effectively ended.\\n36 Thailand: Migrants™ involvement in emergency management as a driver of \\nintegration\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the same time, there are examples of migrants choosing to stay, sometimes successfully, in their host \\ncountries, despite the existence of crisis. In some cases, this resulted in a strengthened sense of community, \\ndue to the involvement of migrants in response and recovery efforts. In Lebanon, for example, those in the \\nmigrant community who remained found themselves turning to each other for support and information \\nafter the 2006 war.\\n37 Once migrants started to work together with their embassies and with NGOs to support \\ndomestic workers affected by the con˜ict, they better understood the importance of coordination and \\ncommunity solidarity. Migrant workers reportedly went from feeling helpless and disconnected prior to and \\nduring the crisis, to being a largely connected and stronger force on the ground.\\n38 After the crisis, migrant \\ndomestic workers maintained strong networks and established the Domestic Workers™ Union. In this particular \\ncase, the lack of international or government support for migrants was seen as the trigger for building more \\nactive grassroots support networks within migrant communities themselves, as they worked to create activist \\ngroups and build their own resilience and coping mechanisms.\\n3936\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n39\\n280Learning from migrant and local capacities \\nThere is much to learn from migrants at all stages of crisis management, from preparedness planning to \\npost-crisis re˜ection. Afghan, Somali and Iraqi refugees were able to contribute and be an integral part of \\ncommunity rebuilding after the 2011 Canterbury earthquakes in New Zealand.\\n40 Likewise for Filipino migrants \\nin the wake of the 2011 Tohoku disaster, affected migrant women spoke about the empowerment and the \\nincreased social capital they gained in the aftermath of the disasters, as they participated in reconstruction \\nefforts.\\n41 During the 2011 ˜oods in Brisbane, Australia, migrant representatives acted as intermediaries between local \\nauthorities and their communities. They supported response efforts through translation and appropriate \\ninformation dissemination, supporting relief agencies in identifying affected persons in need of support, and \\nadvocating with local authorities on behalf of their fellow nationals to ensure that of˚cial assistance received \\nwas adequate and culturally appropriate.\\n42 Furthermore, following the 2015 Hurricane Stan, efforts by the \\nGovernment of Mexico to have a line of direct communication with local stakeholders and representatives from \\nmigrant and host communities marked a clear shift in approach, leading to the Reducing the Vulnerability \\nof Migrants in Emergencies project. The IOM-led project mainstreams migration in national disaster response \\npolicies and plans, while also creating a space for participation of migrants in policymaking.\\n43These examples highlight the opportunities that exist to re-centre conversations at the local level and on \\nmigrant capabilities, and ways to actively include civil society in conversations related to crisis response. It \\nremains the case, however, that more can be done to ensure that recommendations of the MICIC Guidelines\\n44 are implemented beyond the national level at the subnational and local levels.\\n45 Using data to address challenges \\nData on population mobility (such as those available in the UN DESA and World Tourism Organization (WTO) \\ndatabases46) highlight the fact that global mobility trends are wide ranging: when combined with data on \\nhazard exposure or risk, these can support planning, preparedness and effective response measures. As can be \\nseen in table 1, crisis affects countries regardless of development levels, with both developed and developing \\ncountries exposed to signi˚cant risks of crises that can affect migrants. Correlating data on migrant stocks, \\nhazard exposure and risk levels allow for the identi˚cation of countries where crisis may particularly affect \\nmigrant populations.\\nTable 1 correlates data on migrant stocks, hazard exposure and risk levels to show that crises may affect \\ncountries regardless of development levels, and that in both developed and developing countries, potential \\ncrises may affect large numbers of migrants. All countries can therefore bene˚t from more immediate and \\nrobust inclusion of migrants in emergency preparedness and disaster risk reduction planning: the existing \\ndata can inform these decisions at the national or regional levels.\\n40\\n4142\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n43\\n44\\n45\\n46\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n281\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n12\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n19\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n34\\n44\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n60\\n\\n63\\n\\n64\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n282\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n113\\n115116\\n130136\\n\\n142149\\n150\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n155\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMali\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSources:\\n \\n\\n\\nNotes:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n283Figure 1.

These kinds of mapping exercises allow the \\nidenti˚cation of high-risk areas within countries, which are also characterized by a signi˚cant presence of \\nmigrants (including those in transit). Since migrants™ presence is not always captured comprehensively and \\nin a timely fashion by census and population statistics, this kind of local-level disaggregated migration data, \\nwhere they exist, can be integrated into assessments for a more accurate picture of hazard exposure and risk. \\nEffective crisis management should build on precise, local-level information. Disaggregating migration and \\nrisk data at the subnational level is essential for informing emergency management in ways that better include \\nmigrants. Focusing on the more localized administrative level (such as within a district or municipality) can \\nhelp improve the effectiveness of crisis management measures. This level of data correlation and analysis \\nenables relevant institutions to: (a) tailor warnings and emergency communications to the to the speci˚c and \\nappropriate requirements of migrant populations; (b) stockpile or deliver food and non-food items that may \\nbe essential to speci˚c migrant groups; and (c) deploy multilingual or culturally competent personnel in crisis \\n284areas with high migrant presence. When informed by speci˚c and localized data, responses can effectively \\naddress the speci˚c needs of at-risk and affected migrant communities. \\nFigure 2.

The boundaries and names shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official \\nendorsement or acceptance by the International Organization for Migration.\\nSources:\\n IOM, 2019 and ACLED, 2019.\\nThere are, however, challenges to collecting robust, reliable and comparable data,\\n47 and of˚cial migration \\nstatistics are likely to be conservative estimates that do not fully capture the extent of movements. Foreign \\nembassies, missions and consulates rarely have comprehensive information about their nationals abroad. Data \\non asset, livelihood and other material and opportunity losses incurred in crises are often not categorized or \\ndisaggregated. This makes it dif˚cult, if not impossible, to quantify (a)\\n the true loss suffered by migrants, \\n(b) their vulnerability in comparison with other affected groups, and (c)\\n any extraordinary losses unique to \\nmigrants. \\n47\\n\\n\\n285Gathering data through key informants\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the absence of comprehensive and up-to-date datasets, it is important to utilize a variety of information \\nsources and data collection mechanisms. Academic institutions, international organizations, civil society and \\nprivate sector actors provide some of the most detailed and useful stand-alone data sets, but taken together, \\nthese may still be patchy or disconnected. Signi˚cant resources may be required to systematically gather, \\nupdate and safely store relevant, appropriate and timely data. \\nIt should also be noted that loss data do not always capture longer-term well-being impacts, particularly \\nas they relate to a less effective, slower recovery Œ which may be particularly relevant for migrants, who \\nare often excluded from longer-term ˚nancial, housing and livelihood assistance after crises. In addition, \\nwhenever migrants are affected in a crisis, loss estimates should also account for impacts suffered in distant \\nlocations. The impacts migrants suffer may be felt by: (a) their families and communities in countries of \\norigin, in the form of psychological impacts, missing remittance transfers and inability to pay off debts; \\nand (b) people in places migrants return to or move to as a consequence of a crisis, in the form of increased \\npressures on labour markets and availability of services, land and housing.\\n48 Information on migrants™ language pro˚ciency, preferred communication channels, cultural sensitivities \\nrelevant to the provision of emergency services, levels of trust towards responders, and existing capacities at \\nthe community level would allow for stronger and more inclusive crisis planning and response. The limited \\ndegree to which these kinds of data currently exist and inform crisis management is one of the elements \\ncompounding migrants™ vulnerability in times of crisis. \\nInnovative responses and ways forward \\nOne of the key components of innovation is ˚nding ways to enable people to work together. Innovations can \\nlead to partnerships that support the implementation of guidelines and principles outlined in international \\nprotection frameworks and non-binding agreements. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \\n\\n\\n286Development (OECD) \\nOslo Manual 2018: Guidelines for Collecting, Reporting and Using Data on Innovation\\n49 provides a framework for identifying the range of innovations that can be adapted to support migrants in \\ncrisis contexts (table 2).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n49\\n\\n287This section focuses on innovative responses that aim to better connect migrants with information, services \\nand social networks, as these have been shown to deliver better outcomes and can be delivered without \\nrequiring government support or elaborate systems of ˚nancial assistance. There are two interventions that \\nprovide a foundation for improved communication and mobilization: (a) improvements in knowledge and data \\non migrants living in the contexts of crisis, and (b) the use of technology in responding to crisis. \\nThe establishment of regular data standards in tandem with expansion of data collection is necessary to \\nensure effective and long-term analysis of the impacts of policies and practices intended to address the needs \\nof migrants in crisis contexts. Information is needed about the number of migrants present in a speci˚c area Œ \\nespecially at the subnational level Œ in order to enhance preparedness and response. More rigorous analysis is \\nalso needed on the impacts of crises in migrant communities. Although some reports exist on these impacts,\\n50 they remain the exception rather than the rule, and stand as good practices to be scaled and replicated. \\nFor example, in north-eastern Nigeria, questions on language and communication needs were included in \\nIOM™s Displacement Tracking Matrix surveys as a way to ˚ll the information gap that existed concerning the \\nlanguages spoken and understood by those displaced by con˜ict.\\n51 Technology has the potential to assist migrants affected by crises. At a 2018 Techfugees Global Summit in Paris, \\n25 start-ups from across the world presented social enterprise initiatives for addressing the needs of migrants. \\nThe use of these technologies needs to be mainstreamed into global, regional, national and local crisis \\nresponse policy and practice, with attention paid to sensitization programmes, culturally friendly trainings \\nand workshops, to ensure uptake. Trust-building during the preparedness phase, through community-led \\nefforts, can ensure that migrants have the impulse, during emergencies, to rely on technologies that they \\nare familiar with.\\n52 Innovative initiatives that may be scaled to assist migrants in crisis and address current limitations include, \\nbut are not limited to, the following: \\nTranslation and digital information services\\n: Translators Without Borders has developed freely downloadable \\nmultilingual glossary apps accessible online and of˜ine, and has worked with Refucomm to test the \\ndistribution of mother tongue information on legal and asylum procedures via micro-SD cards to recently \\narrived migrants in Greece.\\n53 Other apps, such as IOM™s MigApp, help migrants make informed decisions \\nthroughout their migration process (for example, on health and travel requirements, visa application processes \\nand remittances), and provide migrants a platform to share their experiences.\\n54 Accessible digital translation \\nand information initiatives can bridge the information gap migrants experience due to language barriers and \\nlack of tailored communications. \\nEnhancing accessible communication media\\n: Sri Lanka™s SIM card scheme for workers going abroad is one \\nmodel for ensuring access to communication options for migrants. The existence of hotlines in countries \\nof destination to recover and communicate information that can support migrants is another example. The \\nSendai International Relations Association set up one such multilingual information hotline in 2011.\\n55 50\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\n52\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\n54\\n55\\n288Crowdsourcing platforms to address discrimination against migrants\\n: The African Centre for Migration and \\nSociety at Wits University in Johannesburg and the technology website iAfrikan launched a crowdsourcing \\nplatform called Xenowatch to monitor efforts related to violence against migrants. People can report \\nxenophobic threats or violence to Xenowatch online, by SMS or email. Reports are veri˚ed, anonymized and \\ndocumented on a map using the Ushahidi platform, and shared with the police and UNHCR. Crowdsourcing \\nplatform initiatives are a real-time resource for organizations to advocate for and enhance migrant rights, \\nsecurity, inclusion and community engagement.\\n56 Looking ahead and policy implications \\nMigrants may face particular challenges in accessing documentation, information, resources and assistance in \\ncrisis situations, and may be exposed to additional precariousness and to discrimination.\\n57 Responses have not \\nsystematically addressed this range of challenges before and during crises, and further information and data \\nat the local levels are needed in order to support effective planning and preparedness. However, information \\nwithout funding, political will and the participation of migrants would not suf˚ce to support preparedness. \\nIn most of the examples reviewed, cooperation sprang up spontaneously or as a result of a top-down decision \\nby governments or international organizations. The role and inclusion of grassroots organizations, employers, \\ntechnology partners and the diaspora in situations of emergencies and post-crisis recovery merit greater \\nattention than they have received to date. At the governance level, the implementation of the MICIC Initiative \\ncan inform and accompany the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.\\n58 The inclusion of \\nhuman rights frameworks, such as the Of˚ce of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \\n(OHCHR) Principles and Guidelines, supported by practical guidance, on the human rights protection of \\nmigrants in vulnerable situations,\\n59 can strengthen initiatives and facilitate discussions between State and \\nnon-State actors. \\nOur analysis in this chapter has a number of implications for future policy and practice in this area. These \\nsupport the 15 guidelines of the MICIC Initiative, emphasizing that:\\nŁ Before, during and after crises, stronger preparedness and post-crisis actions are needed. Most large-\\nscale interventions in assistance to migrants in crisis have taken place in an unplanned manner. Instead, \\nmore systematic efforts are required to build on and develop capacities of emergency management \\nactors, foreign embassies, consulates and missions, as well as local institutions and migrants themselves. \\nInvolving non-traditional stakeholders and migrants in the response and coordination mechanisms is key \\nto enhancing ˜exible, effective funding and response. \\nŁ Funding schemes need to be diversi˚ed and strengthened to support greater preparedness and coordination. \\nFlexible and diverse funding can provide new avenues for support systems that can integrate migrants \\nin a non-discriminatory manner. This includes the exploration of linkages with the private sector and \\ndiaspora networks, engaging with and sensitizing donors, while also scaling up initiatives for ˜exible \\ndonor and government ˚nancing of emergency funds for crises response.\\n56\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n59\\n289Ł Post-crisis re˜ections can be enhanced, with responses beyond return to be explored, including local \\nintegration and resettlement. Returns are not the only solution and should not necessarily be the \\npreferred one, given that there is often a lack of support after return. Where migrants are returned, \\nlong-term efforts to measure reintegration and monitor protection outcomes are critical to ensuring that \\nmigrants do not return to situations of greater harm or ˚nd themselves back in crisis situations. \\nŁ Addressing gaps and shortages of data will enable more effective coordination, preparedness, \\ncommunication and provision of assistance. While anecdotal evidence may be available, larger data gaps \\nprevent effective coordinated responses, whether between governments of origin and destination, or \\nother stakeholders. The lack of impact evaluation data impedes the ability to identify fully what makes a \\nresponse effective, while the lack of local level, disaggregated data does not allow for an understanding \\nof the loss experienced by migrants. Enhancing transnational learning can lead to the scaling up of \\nsuccessful practices. \\nŁ Developing a road map for innovations in response to migrants caught in situations of crisis, which \\ntakes into account the above recommendations, can support the elaboration of speci˚c responses, \\nstronger processes, organizational effectiveness and outreach that are more inclusive, both of migrants™ \\nvulnerabilities and their capacities.\\nŁ Finally, and fundamentally, human rights considerations and the humanitarian imperative to save lives \\nshould inform the development of emergency preparedness frameworks, and operational protocols and \\npractices, during disasters. Supporting humanitarian and human rights-based responses requires cooperation \\nof State- and non-State actors, who may hold differing priorities and agendas. It is important to ensure that \\nresponses in crises situations are primarily and substantively human rights-based, rather than based on \\npolitical considerations or populist expediency. In order to uphold international human rights obligations, \\nit is crucial that respect for the human rights of all migrants, irrespective of status, should be on par with \\nthe maintenance of the rights of citizens.\\n60 Greater ˜exibility on visa policies and removal of administrative \\nand security restrictions are known to improve migrant protection and community resilience. These should \\nbe recognized as exceptional measures needed in times of crisis. Support for coordination, negotiation and \\ndiplomacy with relevant countries affected by crisis is necessary in order to ensure that rules are made \\n˜exible to empower migrants to have a broader range of options and make informed decisions. \\n60\\n\\n\\nMARIE MCAULIFFE\\n\\n291RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE GLOBAL \\nGOVERNANCE OF MIGRATION: AN UPDATE \\n TO THE WORLD MIGRATION REPORT 2018\\n1Introduction \\nBy their very nature, international migration and displacement are transnational issues concerning origin and \\ndestination States, as well as States through which migrants may travel (often referred to as ﬁtransitﬂ States) \\nor in which they are hosted following displacement across national borders. And yet, somewhat paradoxically, \\nthe majority of migration governance has historically remained with individual States, their policies and \\nregulations on migration typically made at the national level.\\n2,3 For the most part, migration governance has \\nbeen closely associated with State sovereignty. States retain the power of deciding on the entry and stay \\nof non-nationals because migration directly affects some of the de˚ning elements of a State.\\n4 Bilateral and \\nmultilateral arrangements are features of migration governance, and there are several global arrangements \\nin the form of international treaties in which States have reached agreement on the application of human \\nrights and the related responsibilities of States in speci˚c areas. The 1966 International Covenant on Civil \\nand Political Rights and the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee Convention) are \\ntwo signi˚cant examples, notable for being widely rati˚ed. Other migration conventions have not been so \\nbroadly accepted, such as the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers \\nand Members of Their Families, which still has no traditional countries of destination among its States \\nparties. Beyond this, there have been numerous multilateral and global initiatives, dialogues and processes \\non migration over several decades (see Appendix A for a tabular summary). The Global Compact for Safe, \\nOrderly and Regular Migration (Global Compact for Migration) is another milestone, as the ˚rst internationally \\nnegotiated statement of objectives for migration governance striking a balance between migrants™ rights and \\nthe principle of States™ sovereignty over their territory. Although it is not legally binding, the Global Compact \\nfor Migration was adopted by consensus in December 2018 at a United Nations conference in which more than \\n150 United Nations Member States participated and, later that same month, in the United Nations General \\nAssembly (UNGA), by a vote among the Member States of 152 to 5 (with 12 abstentions). \\nIn the absence of a coherent international regime on migration, unexpected large-scale migration events of \\nsigni˚cance, as well as seismic geopolitical events,\\n5 can have dramatic impacts on global migration governance, \\noperating as ﬁcalls to actionﬂ within the international community. Such events have also brought into sharp \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorld \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11CHAPTER 11 Œ \\n292relief some of the gaps that exist within a fragmented global migration governance framework, and the need \\nfor more action to develop a much more coherent international approach to migration for the betterment of \\nStates, societies and migrants. In 2015 and 2016, for example, the mass movement of more than 1\\n million \\npeople to and through Europe (including Syrian and other refugees) provided some of the impetus for the New \\nYork Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (New York Declaration), adopted at the United Nations General \\nAssembly in September 2016.\\n6 The making of the New York Declaration signalled an important point in the \\nhistory of global migration governance. All 193 United Nations Member States unanimously af˚rmed their \\nsupport for upholding the rights of migrants and refugees, and committed to a process of intergovernmental \\nnegotiations in order to reach agreement on a Global Compact for Migration\\n7 as well as on a Global Compact on \\nRefugees.\\n8 Importantly, the two compacts build upon years of structured dialogues, initiatives and cooperation \\nbetween States, regionally and at the international level. \\nThe \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n included a chapter on global governance of migration, which provided the \\nbackground and context to the adoption of the New York Declaration. It was the ˚rst chapter in Part II on \\ncomplex and emerging migration issues, and was designed to provide a critical overview of existing global \\ngovernance architecture and recent developments.\\n9 The key elements of that chapter included:\\nŁ Discussion of the concept of ﬁgovernanceﬂ;\\nŁ The bene˚ts and barriers to global migration governance;\\nŁ Norms and institutions;\\nŁ Efforts to improve global governance (2001Œ2016).\\nChapter 5 of the \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n also laid the foundation for the remaining chapters in Part \\nII of the 2018 report by providing a context for governance at the global level, in part by highlighting the \\nkey thematic areas in migration that have been the subject of international cooperation in recent times. We \\nencourage readers interested in foundational aspects and contemporary developments of global governance of \\nmigration to refer to this chapter in the \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n.So much has happened in the sphere of global migration governance in the two years since the publication of \\nthe \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n that the editors felt it important to have an update on the topic for readers \\nof the \\nWorld Migration Report 2020\\n. This chapter provides a descriptive analysis that is speci˚c to a point \\nin time\\n10 Œ the implementation and evolution of the system will continue well into the future. In picking \\nup from where the \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n left off, the next section walks through the development \\nand adoption of the two global compacts. The third section offers a brief analysis of the complementarity, \\ncoherence and gaps between the two global compacts. The fourth section outlines an assessment of how the \\nglobal compacts affect global migration governance architecture. The ˚nal section then looks to the future \\nby outlining the implications of these recent developments as well as the challenges for implementation \\nof the global compacts. The chapter builds on information from the policy sphere, academic commentaries \\nand opinion pieces. At the time of writing, very little new academic research had been published on the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n293adoption and implementation of the two global compacts, which is a re˜ection on the time frames involved \\nin academic peer-reviewed publications (see chapter 4 of this report). We expect new academic publications \\non the compacts will increase from the last quarter of 2019. \\nThe development and adoption of the global compactsThe two global compacts sprang from a widespread sense of crisis, as the world faced large-scale movements \\ninvolving people in several locations throughout the world. These events Œ most spectacularly in the \\nMediterranean, but also in the Gulf of Aden/Red Sea and the Bay of Bengal Œ led to the making of the New \\nYork Declaration. The Mediterranean crisis was notable not only for the huge numbers of people involved, but \\nalso for its visibility, unfolding as it did within sight of major Western news outlets. The movements brought \\nhome to the governments of wealthy European States (the intended destinations of migrants) that even \\nthese States, with all their legal and ˚nancial resources, could not cope with ˜ows of this magnitude without \\ncooperation among themselves and with countries of origin and transit.\\n11The United Nations Summit on Refugees and Migrants in September 2016, convened in the shadow of the \\ncrisis, produced a Declaration of commitment on the part of States, the most signi˚cant elements of which \\nwere pledges to negotiate the two global compacts. The initial conception was of a single compact that would \\ncover both refugees and migrants. Several obstacles to this plan presented themselves, including a fear that, \\non the one hand, a dual-purpose compact would dilute the protection to which refugees are entitled under \\nthe Refugee Convention and, on the other hand, that equating refugees and migrants would entail stronger \\nobligations toward migrants than States were willing to accept. Most destination countries, by and large, \\nwould have been content to have one global compact that dealt only with refugees, but other States, most \\nnotably countries of the Global South, insisted on a Global Compact for Migration as well. Both compacts \\nwere envisaged as being legally non-binding, unlike an international treaty that obligates all State parties \\nto implement its provisions.\\n12In addition, conceptual discussions and debates on the various de˚nitions of ﬁrefugeesﬂ and ﬁmigrantsﬂ, as \\nthey relate to the New York Declaration and during the development of the two compacts, were prominent.\\n13 While the New York Declaration noted that ﬁrefugees and migrants have the same universal human rights and \\nfundamental freedomsﬂ,\\n14 a distinction between the two was upheld, as summarized in the Global Compact \\nfor Migration: \\nMigrants and refugees are distinct groups governed by separate legal frameworks. Only refugees are entitled to the speci˜c international protection as de˜ned by international \\nrefugee law.\\n1511\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n15\\n\\n294As a result, the two compacts embrace a residual understanding of ﬁmigrantsﬂ, as people living outside their \\ncountries of origin who are not refugees (˚gure 1): ﬁa diverse, residual category of people who are united by \\nthe feature of not being refugeesﬂ.\\n16 By contrast, the United Nations Population Division uses an inclusive \\nde˚nition whereby any person residing outside his or her country of origin is a migrant.\\n17\\n\\n\\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˘\\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆˇ˘\\n˝\\n˝\\nˆˇ˘\\nˆˇ˘\\nSource:\\n \\n\\nThe processes leading to the two compacts were very different. The Global Compact on Refugees was drafted \\nby the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the lead-up to the September 2016 \\nUnited Nations Summit on Refugees and Migrants, and during UNHCR™s piloting of the Comprehensive \\nRefugee Response Framework (CRRF).\\n18 UNHCR organized a series of thematic discussions with States and \\nother stakeholders, and then entered into consultations with States (see ˚gure 2). It received in total more \\nthan 500 written contributions from United Nations Member States and other stakeholders throughout the \\nprocess.\\n19 UNHCR produced the ˚nal draft, which was adopted during the seventy-third session of the United \\nNations General Assembly in December 2018 after a vote in the Third Committee, with 176 in favour, 1 against \\n(the United States of America) and three abstentions.\\n20,2116\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n19 See \\n20\\n\\n21\\n295\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Global Compact for Migration process, by contrast, was ˚rmly in the hands of States, although with the \\nclose involvement and support of the Of˚ce of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-\\nGeneral for International Migration. Two States, Mexico and Switzerland, were appointed as co-facilitators of \\nthe process, and they took responsibility for drafting the Compact. The ˚rst stage of development consisted \\nof six months of consultations at the global, regional and country levels, followed by a stocktaking exercise. \\n296The co-facilitators produced a ˚rst draft of the Compact, and chaired six rounds of informal consultations \\nat the United Nations over the course of six months.\\n22 The ˚nal version of the text was formally agreed at \\nthe end of the ˚nal round in July 2018, and was adopted at a special conference in Morocco in December \\n2018, ˚ve months after the conclusion of negotiations. The United Nations General Assembly in New York \\nformally endorsed the outcomes of the Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt the Global Compact for Safe, \\nOrderly and Regular Migration, with the results of the General Assembly vote as follows: 152 States in \\nfavour, 5 against and 12 abstentions. The United States withdrew from the process before intergovernmental \\nnegotiations commenced and voted against the Compact at the General Assembly (along with the Czechia, \\nHungary, Israel and Poland). The countries that abstained were Algeria, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Chile, \\nItaly, Latvia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Romania, Singapore and Switzerland.\\n23The rise of nationalism, far-right political parties and anti-migrant sentiment, especially in destination \\ncountries, contributed to several countries withdrawing support for the Compact, which at times involved \\nrhetoric based on misrepresentation of the Compact and its effects.\\n24 For example, the former Immigration \\nMinister of Canada under the Conservative Harper Government, Chris Alexander, publicly denounced comments \\nmade by opposition leader Andrew Scheer on the impact of the Compact by stating: ﬁScheer™s statement is \\nfactually incorrect: this Compact is a political declaration, not a legally binding treaty: it has no impact on \\nour sovereignty\\nﬂ.25The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration \\nThe Global Compact for Migration has four major elements. The ˚rst consists of the early paragraphs that \\nset out the Compact™s vision of better cooperation among States to improve the governance of international \\nmigration.\\n26 They reiterate the principles on which the Compact is built, one of which is that it ﬁreaf˚rms \\nthe sovereign right of States to determine their national migration policy and to govern migration within \\ntheir jurisdiction, in conformity with international lawﬂ.\\n27 The preamble to the Compact acknowledges the \\nrelated human rights instruments, other agreements and the outcomes of prior United Nations meetings on \\nmigration. \\nThe second element is the heart of the document, which consists of 23 objectives that offer a fairly \\ncomprehensive approach to international cooperation on migration (see box below). Each objective has \\nseveral associated actions from which countries will draw in order to realize their commitment to the stated \\ngoal. This is central to the Compact, which \\nreaf˚rms the sovereignty of States over their migration policies.\\n2822\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\n25\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n297Global Compact for Migration™s 23 objectives for safe, orderly and regular migration\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Global Compact for Migration™s 23 objectives can be thought of as falling into three ﬁbasketsﬂ: (1)\\n speci˚c \\nand relatively straightforward measures; (2) speci˚c but contested issues; and (3) very broad and aspirational \\ngoals. \\n298\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome of the objectives are relatively straightforward with wide support, and are subject to immediate \\nimplementation Œ indeed, implementation has already begun on some, including on data collection and \\nresearch, ethical recruitment and remittances, among others. Others Œ such as enhanced legal pathways \\nfor migration, better border management, and cooperation on return and reintegration Œ are speci˚c but \\ncontested and will require further negotiation, commitment of resources and summoning of political will. \\n299Others, such as those in the third category in table 1, are very long-term propositions, notwithstanding \\nthe high degree of agreement on the need for positive change on these issues.\\n29 Their goals are quite far- \\nreaching, so they will indeed take time to realize. For example, the protection of migrants in vulnerable \\nsituations (Objective\\n 7) now extends beyond traditional vulnerability categories (for example, women and \\ngirls, children and traf˚cking victims) to more broadly cover vulnerabilities arising ﬁfrom the circumstances in \\nwhich they travel or the conditions they face in countries of origin, transit and destinationﬂ.\\n30 The realization \\nof some of these objectives is also closely interlinked with the implementation of other initiatives related \\nto development, environment or, more generally, the protection of migrants caught in crises. For instance, \\nObjectives 2 and 19 explicitly refer to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa \\nAction Agenda on ˚nancing for development.\\n31The third element of the Global Compact for Migration deals with implementation. It is clear that States have \\nthe primary responsibility for implementing the 23 objectives of the Compact. To support their efforts, a \\nﬁcapacity-building mechanismﬂ was envisaged, consisting of a knowledge platform, a connection hub and a \\nstart-up fund for projects.\\n32 Importantly, in this section, States pledge to work on implementation with other \\nstakeholders, including migrants, civil society, the private sector, trade unions, local authorities and others. \\nThe Compact also welcomes the Secretary-General™s decision to establish a United Nations Migration Network, \\ncoordinated by IOM, to foster effective, coordinated support to States from the many United Nations entities \\nthat work on migration issues. The Secretary-General is asked to draw on the Network to prepare a biennial \\nreport to the General Assembly on United Nations activities to support implementation of the Global Compact \\nfor Migration. The ˚nal paragraph on implementation recognizes that State-led processes, such as the Global \\nForum on Migration and Development and the regional consultative processes on migration, have important \\nroles to play in furthering international cooperation on migration.\\nFinally, the fourth element of the Global Compact for Migration relates to follow-up and review.\\n33 Progress \\non implementation of the Compact™s objectives will be examined every four years in the General Assembly, \\nstarting in 2022, in an ﬁInternational Migration Review Forumﬂ, which will replace the High-level Dialogue \\non International Migration and Development.\\n34 Regional reviews are to take place every four years alternately \\nwith the Review Forum, starting in 2020. The Compact foresees contributions to these reviews from other \\nState-led processes, such as those mentioned above, as well as IOM™s International Dialogue on Migration. It \\nalso encourages States to institute national-level reviews.  \\n29\\n30\\n\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n300The Global Compact on RefugeesThe New York Declaration explicitly recognized the pressing need for more cooperation in distributing the \\nresponsibility of hosting and supporting the world™s refugees, who are mainly situated in neighbouring \\ncountries (most of which are low- or middle-income countries). The Declaration states:\\nTo address the needs of refugees and receiving States, we commit to a more equitable \\nsharing of the burden and responsibility for hosting and supporting the world™s refugees, \\nwhile taking account of existing contributions and the differing capacities and resources among States.35Unlike the proposed Global Compact for Migration, involving intergovernmental negotiations to reach \\nagreement on a Member State document, the New York Declaration envisaged the Global Compact on Refugees \\nemerging from a process led by UNHCR. The emphasis would be on the further development and practical \\nimplementation of an existing response to refugee issues, the CRRF, with a particular focus on responding to \\nlarge movements of refugees (including in protracted situations). The CRRF, therefore, as outlined in Annex \\n1 of the New York Declaration, is central to the Global Compact on Refugees. The key elements of the CRRF, \\ndeveloped by UNHCR in close coordination with stakeholders and implemented in multiple countries\\n36 during \\nthe Global Compact on Refugees process (see table 2), included reception and admission, support for ongoing \\nneeds, support for host countries and communities, and durable solutions. The core CRRF objectives are to: \\n(1) ease pressure on the host countries involved; (2)\\n enhance refugee self-reliance; (3)\\n expand access to \\nthird-country solutions; and (4)\\n support conditions in countries of origin for return in safety and dignity.\\n37 In addition to the CRRF, the Global Compact on Refugees includes a Programme of Action that builds on the \\nCRRF and sets out measures for States and other relevant stakeholders designed to ensure better responses to \\nrefugee displacement (table\\n 2).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n35\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n301\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProviding adequate funding for host countries and to resettle refugees are two concrete expressions of \\nresponsibility-sharing, but they have both proved challenging throughout the Global Compact on Refugees \\nprocess and will likely continue to be so in the future. It has been dif˚cult to secure funding to enable the \\nfull roll-out of the CRRF, with inadequate donor support hampering the implementation of the framework \\nin several countries, including Uganda and Ethiopia.\\n38 Likewise, the very small number Œ compared with the \\nneed for refugee resettlement places and other durable solutions for the displaced Œ will remain challenging \\nfor the CRRF/Global Compact on Refugees.\\n39 While neither of these challenges is in any way new to the \\ninternational refugee system, or to UNHCR as the mandated United Nations agency and its chief guardian, the \\nGlobal Compact on Refugees process has served to highlight the enduring dif˚culties in these two matters, \\nwhile attempting to garner more support from the international community to enable more practical results \\nto be realized. \\nTo address these two challenges and, more broadly, support Member States™ commitments, the Global Compact \\non Refugees sets up different follow-up, review and implementation mechanisms. A Global Refugee Forum is \\nto be convened every four years, with the ˚rst one scheduled for December 2019. The objective of this Forum \\nis, ˚rst, for United Nations Member States to make formal pledges and contributions in the form of ˚nancial, \\nmaterial or technical assistance or resettlement places and complementary pathways for admission, and \\nthen report on key achievements and good practices.\\n40 This global arrangement for international cooperation \\n\\n39\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n302is complemented by national arrangements that can be established by host countries to coordinate the \\nmeasures taken by relevant stakeholders working toward achieving a comprehensive response.\\n41 To avoid \\nfuture ﬁrefugee crisesﬂ, a Support Platform can also be activated upon the request of the host country(ies) \\nor country(ies) of origin in two cases: \\nŁ A large-scale and/or complex refugee situation where the response capacity of a host State is or is \\nexpected to be overwhelmed; or \\nŁ A protracted refugee situation where the host State(s) require(s) considerable additional support, and/or \\na major opportunity for a solution arises (for example, large-scale voluntary repatriation to the country \\nof origin).\\n42 Led by a group of States, Support Platforms can initiate solidarity conferences for a particular situation in \\norder for States and relevant stakeholders to contribute ˚nancially, materially and technically, or provide \\nresettlement places and complementary pathways for admission.\\n43The non-binding nature of the Global Compact on Refugees and the focus on implementation and action have \\nresulted in some commentators pointing to worrying signs for the likelihood of sustainable change, given that \\nStates will be able to pick and choose the approaches that are more attractive to them at a time when the \\ncurrent geopolitical climate on refugees and displacement is unfavourable.\\n44 Other concerns have related to \\nthe focus on the Refugee Convention as the core of the Global Compact on Refugees, or the relative neglect \\nof related rights expressed in other key instruments, as well as aspects of displacement not covered by the \\nexisting refugee regime.\\n45Complementarity, coherence and gaps between the two global \\ncompactsNotwithstanding the high pro˚le of the 2016 New York Declaration, and the related commitment of all States \\nto ˚nalize the two global compacts, the content of the compacts did not spring out of nowhere. There has \\nbeen a much longer lead time in developing the ideas and approaches in the compacts than may ˚rst appear. \\nAs highlighted in the introduction to this chapter, the two compacts build upon years of structured dialogues, \\ninitiatives and cooperation between States, regionally and at the international level. The Global Compact for \\nMigration in particular builds on recent global and regional migration initiatives and processes,\\n46 including \\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n\\n\\n45\\n\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n303by addressing thematic areas where States™ interests have converged\\n47 (see appendix B for more detail). As for \\nthe Global Compact on Refugees, it focuses on ﬁtranslat[ing] [the] long-standing principle [of] international \\ncooperation enshrined in the preamble of the 1951 Refugee Convention into concrete and practical actionﬂ for \\nﬁpredictable and equitable burden- and responsibility-sharingﬂ.\\n48 The Global Compact on Refugees reinforces \\nand strengthens previous efforts, including, for instance, by answering the repeated calls for international \\ncooperation made by the UNHCR Executive Committee,\\n49 as well as by consolidating UNHCR-led initiatives for \\nspeci˚c cases of ad hoc responsibility-sharing.\\n50 The two global compacts are not mutually exclusive, but have been designed to complement one another in \\nrecognition of the ﬁmany common challenges and [–] similar vulnerabilitiesﬂ of migrants and refugees.\\n51 The \\ntwo compacts are considered by UNHCR and IOM to be functionally coherent when it comes to the common \\nchallenges they seek to address.\\n52 The Global Compact for Migration is broader in scope than the Global Compact \\non Refugees, ﬁaddressing migration in all its dimensionsﬂ. Thus, it complements the more limited focus of the \\nGlobal Compact on Refugees on the speci˚c challenges of large movements of refugees, including situations of \\nprotracted displacement.\\n53 Offering a ﬁ360-degree vision of international migrationﬂ,\\n54 the Global Compact for \\nMigration addresses issues throughout the migration cycle, be it upon departure from the country of origin; \\nduring migrants™ journeys, including in transit countries; upon arrival and stay in the country of destination; \\nor upon return to the country of origin. In their early drafts, neither global compact addressed displacement \\nassociated with the impact of climate change and environmental degradation. Some stakeholders hoped that \\nprotection of people displaced by these forces would be included in the Global Compact on Refugees, but \\nStates did not agree. The ˚nal text of the Global Compact for Migration did, however, include a subsection \\non ﬁnatural disasters, the adverse effects of climate change and environmental degradationﬂ under Objective \\n2 (Minimize the adverse drivers and structural factors that compel people to leave their country of origin).\\n55 The different scope and purposes of the two compacts avoided contradictions between them and achieved \\ngeneral coherence. But the two left another important area of potential overlap unresolved: mixed ˜ows \\nof refugees moving onward from countries of ˚rst asylum with other migrants in large-scale movements.\\n56 The unplanned arrival of large numbers of people, including some who have solid claims for international \\nrefugee protection and some who do not, places huge demands on national asylum systems and humanitarian \\ninstitutions. Even those who are not refugees may be in desperate need of assistance and protection, such as \\nunaccompanied children, and the Global Compact for Migration addresses their needs in Objective 7 (Address \\nand reduce vulnerabilities in migration). But neither compact comes to grips with the phenomenon of \\nﬁsecondary movementsﬂ by refugees. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n49\\n\\n50\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n51\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n54\\n\\n55\\n\\n\\n56\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n304One of the key lessons from the 2015Œ2016 movements to and through Europe is the number of refugees \\nwho were able to travel on from the ˚rst country they reached after being displaced from their countries \\nof origin, in search of greater safety or more promising prospects. In Europe in 2015Œ2016, the volume of \\nsecondary movements was partly due to geography (particularly the close proximity of Turkey and Greece) \\nand crowded conditions in ˚rst countries of asylum, but also because of more fundamental changes in \\ntechnology (including that used by smugglers), ﬁmobile moneyﬂ and information exchange.\\n57 The story of \\nPaolina Roccanello (see below) highlights just how much the world has changed since the end of the Second \\nWorld War: while refugees had at that time a limited capacity to move by themselves beyond the con˚nes of \\nEurope, this is no longer the case. \\nMigration before appification\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSS Misr\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome refugees are now able to migrate on their own, exercising a degree of self-agency.\\n58 Contrary to the \\nﬁbinary constructﬂ between forced and voluntary migration,\\n59 refugees often move for mixed motivations, \\nmeaning that:\\nThey may have left their home countries because of con˚ict or persecution, but they have chosen a destination country because of the economic opportunities it affords. They may \\nwell ˜t the refugee de˜nition and cannot be returned home.60 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n59\\n\\n\\n\\n60\\n305Many people (including refugees) are unable to move directly to their preferred destinations, for lack of \\nvisa access, for instance, and may ˚rst travel through one or more transit countries to reach their preferred \\ndestination, or end up in countries that are not their ˚rst choice of destination.\\n61 While this complex \\nreality of ﬁmixed motiveﬂ migration is becoming more common and raises challenges to States in terms \\nof secondary refugee movements, it is largely beyond the ambit of the two global compacts. As previously \\nnoted, and despite its broad scope, the Global Compact for Migration is limited to migrants in the ﬁresidualﬂ \\nsense Œ that is, migrants who are not refugees.\\n62 The Compact refers to ﬁmixed movementsﬂ, which do not \\nexplicitly acknowledge that many people have mixed motives for migration, but rather concern the mixed \\nnature of movements involving migrants and refugees.\\n63 Before the Global Compact for Migration™s text was \\n˚nalized, it referred to the provision to migrants of ﬁinformation on rights and obligations in migration laws \\nand procedures, including on \\naccess to the right to seek asylum\\n or other adequate forms of protectionﬂ,\\n64 indicating that some migrants may have a claim to refugee status. That language was dropped from the ˚nal \\ntext, indicating the sensitivities and complexities of this issue. This grey area is one that has the potential \\nto result in confusion or even gaps.\\n65 That said, the frameworks of the compacts do not prevent cooperation \\nbetween States on mixed motive migration, and speci˚c parts of the Global Compact for Migration encourage \\ncooperation that would assist in addressing this issue (for example, Objective 5: Enhance availability and \\n˜exibility of pathways for regular migration). Similarly, the Global Compact on Refugees seeks pathways \\nbeyond conventional resettlement of refugees to move from host countries in order to pursue, for example, \\neducational or career opportunities. In addition, there already are many measures in place to accommodate \\nthis increasingly important aspect of migration Œ one of the most pertinent being regional free movement \\nagreements with eligibility based on nationality rather than policy category or reason for migrating. \\nHow do the global compacts influence the global migration \\ngovernance architecture? \\nDespite their common origin in the 2015 migration crises and the New York Declaration, the two global compacts \\noccupy quite different positions in the architecture of global migration governance. The Global Compact on \\nRefugees is grounded in established international law, speci˚cally in the widely rati˚ed Refugee Convention. \\nAlthough migrants are entitled to the same protections that apply to others under international human rights \\nlaw (as are refugees), there is no equivalent to the Refugee Convention for migrants. Consequently, and even \\nthough it is not legally binding, the Global Compact for Migration represents more of an innovation in global \\ngovernance of migration than does the Global Compact on Refugees.\\nThe Global Compact on Refugees is all about implementation: how to create mechanisms of burden- and \\nresponsibility-sharing that will strengthen the refugee regime by giving more support to host countries and \\nfostering refugee self-suf˚ciency. While the Global Compact on Refugees does not aspire to change refugee \\nlaw, it does represent a substantial change of emphasis for UNHCR. The refugee agency has traditionally seen \\nits role primarily as the guardian of the Refugee Convention, overseeing States™ ful˚lment of their obligations \\n61\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n62\\n\\n63\\n64\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n65\\n306to protect refugees and seeking durable solutions that allow refugees to stop being refugees. It has also \\nassumed a major role in marshalling humanitarian assistance. The Global Compact on Refugees places much \\ngreater emphasis on support for host country governments and communities, recognizing the service they \\nprovide, not only to refugees, but to the international community as a whole Œ which should be the basis for \\nmuch more robust solidarity expressed as burden Œ and responsibility-sharing.\\nThe system the Global Compact on Refugees lays out for achieving greater solidarity with refugee hosts \\npresents a further shift of the refugee regime by giving actors other than States a more central role. Non-\\ngovernmental humanitarian organizations have long played a major part in protecting and assisting refugees, \\nbut the Compact envisages more active engagement with the private sector, subnational authorities and \\nother stakeholders. The addition of a regular review event is an additional architectural element, which \\nshould make it harder for prolonged refugee situations, or those that do not make the headlines, to drop off \\nthe international agenda. The uneven distribution of resources among host countries has undermined the \\nstability of the refugee regime. The inclusion of an academic network signals a positive move toward evidence-\\nbased responses to coincide with greater involvement of non-State actors in the implementation of the CRRF. \\nHowever, some have raised concerns about the nature, scope and focus of the network, raising questions \\nabout how it would be managed and what value it would add.\\n66While acknowledging the importance of non-State actors through its whole-of-society approach, the Global \\nCompact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration frames the construction of cooperation on migration among \\nStates, but the roof and walls and ˜oors will have to be added by States in the course of implementation. \\nSince there has never been such a construct, it is dif˚cult to foresee how heavily States will invest in bringing \\nthe Global Compact™s objectives to life. With 23 objectives and 187 speci˚c actions, implementing the Global \\nCompact for Migration will not be easy. No country has the capacity to work on all the recommended actions, \\nand almost all will ˚nd some actions they would prefer not to take. The strength of the Compact is that it has \\nsomething for everyone; that inclusiveness is fundamental to the compromises the Compact struck in order \\nto get near-universal agreement. \\nInstitutional architectureThe global migration governance chapter of the \\nWorld Migration Report 2018\\n provides an overview of the \\ninternational institutional arrangements, with particular reference to three agencies involved in migration Œ \\nIOM, UNHCR and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Œ as well as the United Nations™ Global Migration \\nGroup and the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for International Migration.\\n67 The last two years have seen signi˚cant change in institutional settings within the United Nations system, \\nmost of which relates directly to supporting States™ implementation of the Global Compact for Migration. The \\nmandate of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for International Migration \\ncame to an end at the end of 2018 and has not been renewed; IOM has entered the United Nations system, and \\nthe Global Migration Group has been succeeded by the United Nations Network on Migration. The reformation \\nof the institutional architecture was instigated by the Secretary-General following the consultation and \\nstocktaking phases of the Global Compact for Migration, and highlighted speci˚cally in his report \\nMaking \\nMigration Work for all,\\n in which he stated: \\n66\\n\\n\\n307I will initiate internal consultations on how best to con˜gure the United Nations system, including IOM, to coordinate the actions of the Organization on migration. I am determined to ensure that the system is fully positioned to respond promptly and effectively in supporting implementation of the global compact, once it is adopted. In conducting these \\nconsultations within the system, I will place a premium on drawing on existing expertise, ensuring operational deliverables in response to the needs of the Member States and ensuring ef˜ciency.\\n68One major outcome of the consultations within the United Nations system initiated by the Secretary-General \\nwas the recommendation to create a United Nations Network on Migration. It was accepted by the Secretary-\\nGeneral and endorsed by the United Nations Executive Committee in May 2018, and formally launched by \\nthe Secretary-General on 9 December 2018, the eve of the Intergovernmental Conference to Adopt the Global \\nCompact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.\\n69 It has been presented as part of broader United Nations \\nreforms. The Network is a successor to the Global Migration Group, and has the following features:\\nŁ A clear focus on ensuring effective and coherent system\\n-wide support to the implementation of the \\nGlobal Compact for Migration;\\nŁ Direct reporting to the Secretary\\n-General on its activities, who will, in turn, report to the Member States \\nas required;\\nŁ Core membership and an extended membership, with the former comprising those United Nations entities \\nwith clear mandate\\n-driven relevance and capacity, and now referred to as the Executive Committee;\\nŁ Working groups based on the Global Compact for Migration and the 2030\\n Agenda for Sustainable \\nDevelopment, and responsive to the needs of Member States;\\nŁ Periodic meetings of the Network™s extended membership, together with other stakeholders, for \\ninformation\\n-sharing and agenda\\n-setting;\\nŁ IOM as Network coordinator and Secretariat.\\n70The Network™s Executive Committee comprises IOM, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social \\nAffairs (UN DESA), ILO, the Of˚ce of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the \\nUnited Nations Children™s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UNHCR and \\nthe United Nations Of˚ce on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), with the Director General of IOM as the Network \\nCoordinator. The extended Network membership includes the Executive Committee entities plus an additional \\n30 United Nations entities.\\n71 The Network, therefore, is larger than its predecessor, the Global Migration \\nGroup, which grew over time to include 22 entities. However, the establishment of an Executive Committee \\nof eight, together with a single Coordinator and reporting arrangements that involve the Secretary-General, \\nindicate that the emphasis on deliverable achievements and United Nations coherence have featured heavily \\nin the thinking underpinning the Network™s construction. \\n\\n\\n69\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n308At a time when nationalism is on the rise in key locations, and the support for multilateralism has been \\nchallenged, the pressure on the Network to succeed will be great. The focus on clearer management and \\ncoordination processes that underpin the Network is in contrast to those processes of the Global Migration \\nGroup, as articulated in their respective terms of reference.\\n72 But coordination is not the main function of the \\nNetwork; rather, it is to support Member States in implementing the Global Compact for Migration. On many of \\nthe issues for which that support will be needed, no single United Nations entity has the necessary expertise \\nand capacity; these entities will need to join forces in implementing actions and projects, collaborating in \\nNetwork working groups, to bring their combined capacities to bear. Some projects will be supported by the \\nMigration Multi-Partner Trust Fund, which was established on 8 May 2019 by the principals of the eight \\nUnited Nations entities of the Network™s Executive Committee and launched on 16 July 2019. The Fund \\nis embedded in the United Nations Migration Network to support Member States™ implementation of the \\nGlobal Compact for Migration, primarily at the country level.\\n73 Notwithstanding these fundamental changes \\nto how the United Nations responds to and coordinates on Global Compact for Migration implementation, the \\ncore principles guiding the operation of the Network remain as they were for the Global Migration Group Œ \\nspeci˚cally, the focus on migrants™ rights and well-being Œ but with the additional focus on implementation \\nwithin communities of destination, origin and transit.\\n74The current phase in the evolution of migration global governance: \\nImplications for the future \\nThe global compacts mark a new phase in international cooperation to manage and respond to the movement \\nof people. Although they are not legally binding, they represent a near-universal consensus on the issues \\nthat require cooperation, and on actions to move toward achieving the objectives laid out in the compacts.\\nThe Global Compact on Refugees, if implemented consistently, will reinforce the willingness of States to \\nhost refugees, by breaking their sense of abandonment when their burdens are not shared with others. If \\nthe commitment of other States and a wider group of stakeholders is consolidated through Comprehensive \\nRefugee Response Frameworks for all host countries, the fundamental condition for protection Œ access to \\nterritorial asylum in another country Œ will be immeasurably reinforced. \\nUnited Nations Member States crafted the Global Compact for Migration with an eye to the long term, but \\nit already has one accomplishment to its credit: it has brought one of the last outstanding global issues \\ninto the United Nations in a formal, negotiated manner. For decades, the international system has had \\nstandards and institutions to facilitate cooperation and the maintenance of order on issues of ˚nance and \\ntrade, arms control and refugees, and many other issues. More recently, it has developed a framework for \\ndealing with climate change. But international migration remained a patchwork of unilateral, bilateral and \\nregional policies, long considered too divisive for general debate within the United Nations as a stand-alone \\nissue beyond its interrelationship with development. With the Global Compact for Migration, a framework of \\ncommon expectations and obligations has at long last emerged. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n309The very ˚rst draft of the Global Compact for Migration identi˚ed a ﬁcoherent UN systemﬂ as necessary for \\neffective implementation. As mentioned, the Compact welcomed the Secretary-General™s decision to replace \\nthe Global Migration Group of United Nations agencies, with a United Nations Migration Network with clearer \\nand consistent leadership from IOM and a small group of United Nations entities that have movement of people \\nas an important part of their mandate or capacities. The agreement that brought IOM into the United Nations \\nsystem as a related organization in 2016 gives the United Nations system unprecedented capacity to help its \\nmembers address migration issues. The United Nations has also strengthened its capacity by establishing the \\nNetwork on Migration. With this structure in place as of December 2018, the United Nations system should \\nbe positioned to offer coherent and comprehensive support to States as they set about implementing their \\ncommitments to safe, orderly and regular migration.\\nWhile the Global Compact for Migration may not be legally binding on States, it can be construed as a \\nﬁpolitical commitmentﬂ creating an expectation of implementation.\\n75 The Compact is the ˚rst agreement \\nthat has been negotiated intergovernmentally at the global level, and heralds a signi˚cant step forward in \\ninternational cooperation. The negotiations followed a series of thematic consultations and a stocktaking \\nexercise that in many ways were similar to previous international and regional dialogues, meetings and \\nother events on international migration over recent years. The intergovernmental negotiations phase, \\nhowever, represented the ˚rst time that States sat side-by-side to negotiate and agree upon a speci˚c text on \\ninternational migration. The signi˚cance of this cannot be overstated; it has taken place in an environment \\nincreasingly challenged by toxic political discourses that can at times result in misrepresentation of key facts \\non migration, confounding and confusing members of a public concerned about the impact of seemingly \\nuncontrolled migration on their lives and the future of their communities. \\nOne of the challenges will be how the United Nations and its Member States deal with the expected shifts \\nin political support and changing commitments to implementation of the global compact. Unlike processes \\nrelated to the adoption and implementation of treaties (as well as withdrawal), which are necessarily long \\nand involved, support for the non-legally binding compacts is ˚rst and foremost political. It is likely that, as \\ngovernments at the national level change over time, which they inevitably will do, there will be a ﬁmoving \\nfeastﬂ of State support, particularly in relation to key destination countries. Implementing positive and \\nconstructive policies and practices on international migration as complexity increases and fragmentation \\nbecomes more deeply embedded will take leadership and unwavering commitment on the part of the vast \\nmajority of States, the United Nations system and the many other actors involved. The most likely forms of \\ncooperation among States on the speci˚c issues addressed in the two compacts were identi˚ed by the late \\nSpecial Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for International Migration Peter Sutherland \\nas being coalitions of States with strong, overlapping interests in a given issue.\\n76 It is possible to imagine \\nStates with different starting points converging on actions to tackle a problem such as lack of legal identity \\nof migrants, or obstacles to return, and readmission in safety and dignity. Such ﬁmini-multilateralismﬂ may \\nemerge as a preferred mode of collaboration on an issue that has eluded effective cooperation among States \\nfor too long. This type of approach produced the Migrants in Countries in Crisis Guidelines.\\n77 Commentators \\nare urging all parties and onlookers to maintain reasonable expectations as Global Compact for Migration \\nimplementation will undoubtedly involve long-term, incremental advances.\\n78 Nevertheless, ﬁeven small \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n310progress under the umbrella of this ‚new deal™ for migrants will help to move us forward Œ towards a world \\nwhere the movement of people across international borders is safer, better regulated and widely embraced as \\nmutually rewarding for everyone involvedﬂ.\\n79 \\n313AppendicesChapter 3Appendix A.

A brief overview of academic publishing \\nThe scholarly dissemination system rotates around a well-established gravitational centre: publication, with \\nsome forms of publication (such as academic journals) having much greater credibility and weight than \\nothers (and within that, individual academic publishers have different standings). Publishing the results of \\nresearch in academic journals is without any doubt the paramount objective of today™s scholars.\\n1 Journals \\nalone constitute about 40\\n per cent (books 16%) of the revenues of the broader scienti˚c, technical and \\nmedical publisher™s market, the size of which has been estimated at USD 25.2 billion in 2013.\\n2 Through \\nacademic publishing, scholars formally share their ˚ndings within the scienti˚c community. This exchange \\nenables other researchers to learn about the latest advancements, to design new studies for ˚lling current \\nknowledge gaps, to compare their ˚ndings with the ones of their peers and perhaps to avoid reinventing the \\nwheel. Moreover, publication constitutes ﬁ...a permanent record of what has been discovered, when and by \\nwhom Œ like a court register for scienceﬂ.\\n3 The world™s ˚rst academic journal Œ \\nPhilosophical Transactions of the \\nRoyal Society Œ appeared as early as of 1665, as an expression of the Royal Society™s policy of promoting the \\nprogress of science through open sharing of results and ideas supported by empirical evidence. Since then, \\nthe number of active scholarly peer-reviewed English language journals had reached 28,100 in 2014,\\n4 and \\nit has been calculated that the global scienti˚c output doubles every nine years.\\n5 Many scholars today are \\noverwhelmed by the mass of academic literature, and it is becoming impossible to ˚nd the time to read every \\npiece of literature, even on the narrowest topic. \\nPublications are the core of career advancement for academics, whereas researchers working in applied \\nresearch settings are not necessarily working under the same degree of pressure to publish. Overall, the \\nacademic reward system is responsible for the very signi˚cant increase in the number of publications but, \\narguably, a quantitative increase does not automatically lead to an increase in the average ﬁqualityﬂ of \\npublished academic research. \\nMeasuring quality is a complex and debated issue. In terms of the major form of output (journal articles), we \\ncan say that an article™s quality is evaluated mainly \\nqualitatively before\\n publication, and mainly \\nquantitatively \\nafter publication. The type of qualitative evaluation that occurs before publication in academic journals is \\ncalled ﬁpeer-reviewﬂ. The term ﬁpeerﬂ refers to the fact that the people performing reviews of the submitted \\narticle are meant to be of equal (or greater) expertise on a topic. Peer review in academia is almost always \\nunpaid. Peer review of journal articles ﬁ...has traditionally been seen as part of the professional obligations of \\nthe researcherﬂ,\\n6 and a large scale-survey amongst 40,000 research papers authors found that most of them \\nconsidered peer review as ﬁ...essential to the communication of scholarly researchﬂ. Ninety-one per cent of \\nthe respondents stated that ﬁ...the review process improved the quality of the last paper they publishedﬂ, and \\n 86 per cent declared that ﬁ...they enjoy reviewing and will continue to reviewﬂ.\\n7 The most tangible incentive for \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n319reviewing is perhaps earning recognition: journals usually publish a yearly ﬁreviewers thanksgivingﬂ document \\nin which they list the names of people who served as reviewers.\\n8  Being on those lists can improve a researcher™s \\nCV, especially if s/he plans to seek funding/job in that speci˚c ˚eld. Reviewers thoroughly examine the \\nmethods, results and conclusions before submitting their recommendation (accept/revise/reject) to the \\njournal™s editor. The review process iterates until the editor is satis˚ed with the manuscript, which can ˚nally \\nenter the production pipeline (copy-editing, typesetting, online publication and possibly printing). Overall, \\nthe peer-review process lasts from a few weeks to several months, with considerable variance among disciplines \\nand journals. After publication, abstracts are free of charge, while access to the full text may require access \\nthrough academic libraries (that typically pay subscriptions to the publishers), or require pay-per-view fees. \\nThe ﬁopen accessﬂ publishing model grants free full-text access to anyone, courtesy of the author™s institution \\nhaving paid publication fees to the publisher. \\nThe peer-review process examines a piece of writing before publication using mainly a \\nqualitative\\n approach, \\nwhile a \\nquantitative\\n approach dominates the assessment of material after publication. Citation Œ the act of \\nquoting Œ is the single unit at the base of bibliometrics (the statistical analysis of written publications). \\nCrudely put, the more the citations, the higher the impact, the better the supposed quality of a paper/\\narticle/book. Basic citation metrics for any publication can be obtained using \\nGoogle Scholar\\n, the most used \\nsearch engine by academics worldwide. For instance, a search for ﬁmigrationﬂ in Google Scholar returned 3.8 \\nmillion results and the following ˚rst page:\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n320You can see at a glance (˚gure 1, bottom-left) that the book ﬁThe age of migration: International population \\nmovements in the modern worldﬂ has been cited by more than 8,000 other publications. By clicking on ﬁCited \\nby 8219ﬂ you can see all the citing publications since the ˚rst edition (1993). If you click on the author™s name \\n(S. Castles) you will see the author™s citation indices.\\nBuilding on raw citation counts, various so-called ﬁimpact metricsﬂ can be calculated at the publication level, \\nauthor level, journal level and so forth. For instance, a journal™s Impact Factor (the \\ncitations/publications \\nratio) is widely used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal, while the h-index\\n10 provides a measure \\nof a single author™s impact (though it can be also calculated for a department, institution or country). The \\ncitations/publications ratio most commonly involves examination of a two-year publishing cycle over three \\nyears. For example, for Journal X™s 2015 impact factor, 122 citations of articles published in 2013 and 2014 are \\ndivided by the total number of articles published in 2013 and 2014 (166), so that the 2015 impact factor for \\nJournal X is 0.735 (or 122 citations divided by 166 articles).\\nThe debate on the usefulness of impact metrics is still open, the aim being ˚nding the right balance between \\nresearch funders™ needs of measuring the impact of their spending, and academics™ desires for fair evaluation \\nsystems of their work (and consequent funding). Recently, alternative impact metrics (altmetrics) have been \\ndeveloped, taking into account, for instance, number of mentions in news articles and blogs, Twitter, Facebook \\nand so forth.\\nThe pressure to achieve within an academic reward system that values publication in peer-reviewed journals \\nis acknowledged as having some serious downsides,\\n11 including in relation to quality. The ﬁpublish or perishﬂ \\nculture has been found to sti˜e research innovation,\\n12 lower research publication standards,\\n13 encourage \\npeer-review fraud\\n14 and negatively affect the ability of researchers to work on applied research tailored to \\npolicymakers.\\n15 At the same time, academics are under pressure to undertake innovative research, publish in \\nthe top journals and present evidence to policy audiences and ultimately in˜uence policy.\\n16 10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n12\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n16\\n321Appendix B. Contributions from academic journals17International Migration\\n18Chief Editor: Howard Duncan2017 and 2018 were years during which the international community, with a degree of co-operation rarely seen \\nin the ˚eld of migration, agreed to two sets of guiding policy principles, the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, \\nand Regular Migration and the Global Compact on Refugees. Never before have we witnessed such a testament \\nto the global importance of migration nor such a widespread ambition to better management of international \\nmigration of all kinds and its effects on the migrants, their societies of destination, and their homelands. These \\nagreements were borne out of a sense of crisis with a particular focus on the Mediterranean region; we now wait \\nto see if the hope they inspire will bear tangible fruit. The owner of \\nInternational Migration\\n, the International \\nOrganization for Migration, was heavily involved in the effort to achieve these agreements, especially the \\nGlobal Compact for Migration. Since the previous World Migration Report, the IOM has become a member of the \\nUnited Nations family of organizations and, with a membership now of more than 170 states it is a truly global \\ninstitution. This journal, appropriately, can also claim a global status in that its authors are from around the \\nworld and with authors from no single country dominating its contents. \\nInternational Migration\\n is pleased by \\nits global reach which has been achieved despite the challenges associated with publishing double-blind peer-\\nreviewed material from less developed countries.\\nThe journal continues to regard its audience as both the global academic and policy communities, and it will \\nretain its requirement of policy-related content in the articles it publishes. In 2017, \\nInternational Migration\\n took a further step in this direction by introducing a series of occasional interviews with senior policy of˚cials, \\nnotably national Ministers responsible for managing migration. Three such interviews have appeared over the \\ncourse of 2017-2018 with contributions from migration Ministers from Canada, Germany, and Australia. In \\nkeeping with our global aspirations, Ministers responded not only to questions about their country™s domestic \\nmigration policies but about their approach to the discussions at the United Nations on the Global Compacts. \\nMigration policy, like migration scholarship, can be fraught with controversy; these interviews did not shy \\naway from contentious issues.\\nThe previous two years have seen numerous special issues and special sections of regular issues, most of them \\nproposed to us from members of the academic community. Topics and geographical coverage were widespread \\nand included:\\nŁ Interculturalism in Times of Crisis (Bello and Bloom)\\nŁ Cultivating the Migration-Food Security Nexus (Crush and Caesar, eds.)\\nŁ Peace Processes and Durable Returns (Stefanovic and Loizides, eds.)\\nŁ Blessed Be the Ties: Health and Healthcare for Migrants and Migrant Families in the United States (Ervin, \\nHamilton and Lopez-Carr, eds.)\\nŁ Labour Migration in Europe: Changing Policies Œ Changing Organizations Œ Changing People (Laubenthal, \\ned.)Ł Subjective Perceptions Related to Migration (Amit and Blum, eds.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n322Ł Migration and Social Class (Bonjour and Chauvin, eds.)\\nŁ Precarity, Illegality, and Temporariness: Implications and Consequences of Canadian Migration Management \\n(Hari and Liew, eds.)\\nSome selected thematic trendsThe academic literature on migration responds in part to trends in migration phenomena and policy as well as \\nto shifts in migration-related theory and previously published literature. Normally, there is a discernible time \\nlag between the onset of a phenomenon and the appearance of scienti˚c literature, this owing to the time \\nrequired for research and then for publishing. The literature on the Syrian refugee crisis is now beginning to \\nappear in signi˚cant amounts, and we can expect that the literature on the United Nations™ Global Compacts \\nwill start appearing in 2019. But looking back only slightly, to 2017 Œ 2018, we see discussions of earlier trends \\nand phenomena, some of which we have selected here.\\nMigrant vulnerabilityTo a large degree, the UN Global Compacts illustrate the current global concern over protecting the human rights \\nof migrants. Although there is clear recognition of the bene˚ts that migrants bring to both their destination and \\nhome societies, states are now being asked to foreground migrants™ needs and to provide supports, especially as \\nthey relate to human rights. In tandem with this, many scholars looked at the vulnerabilities of migrants over \\nthe past two years, whether the vulnerabilities concern human traf˚cking (Rocha-Jiminez et al.), earnings \\ngaps as compared to nationals (Wu et al.), discrimination in other forms (Gong), slave-like working conditions \\n(Palmer), disparities in health care provision (Geeraert), the special vulnerabilities of refugees and women and \\nchildren (Pavez-Soto and Chan), and even the vulnerabilities of migrant entrepreneurs who ˚nd themselves in \\ncompetition with locals (Pineteh). \\nFamilies and migrationWhen Oded Stark and David Bloom published their now iconic article, ﬁThe New Economics of Labour Migrationﬂ, \\nin 1985, they not only created a new way of looking at migration economics but they launched continuing \\ninvestigations into the relationship between migration and development, the role of remittances in migration, \\nhow people make decisions to migrate, and the role of their families in these decisions. The emphasis on \\nfamilies in the migration literature continues to grow, and \\nInternational Migration\\n has been among those \\njournals to feel this emphasis. A major interest is with those family members who are left behind, the emotional \\ndif˚culties they may face, as described by Fuller, despite modern ICTs; the effects on schooling as described by \\nYabiku and Agadjanian and, separately, by Kuépié; and the effects on marriages themselves which, as shown \\nby Davis and Jennings and separately by Silver, et al., can be deeply troubling. But migration can itself be \\nfor marriage, and this phenomenon has received a great deal of attention, especially in Asia and especially \\nin South Korea where marriage migration represents a high proportion of all migration to that country. The \\nmulticultural families that result are the object of Kim and Kilkey™s study on integration outcomes for foreign \\nbrides to South Korea; Kim and Kilkey looked at the country™s policy on multicultural families, regarding it \\nas designed with the country™s future population size in mind; and Cho considers cultural aspects of marriage \\nmigration to that country. The population prospects might not be as rosy as some hope, however, if what Mora, \\nFernandez, and Torre found regarding fertility rates of migrants to Spain and the US. \\n323Migration and developmentOne of the more enduring areas of recent scholarship has been on the relationship between migration and \\ndevelopment, a ˚eld that has been greatly stimulated by the discussion within the international community. \\nThe core feature of these studies remains remittances, both their effects and the propensity of migrants to \\nsend them. Diaspora philanthropy was the emphasis of Koff™s study, while Petreski, Petreski, and Tumanoska \\nconsidered the effects of remittances on household vulnerability. Urama et al. looked at the effects of \\nremittances on the homeland labour supply; Akcay and Karasoy linked remittances to calorie consumption; \\nArouri and Nguyen found a strong connection to poverty reduction; Kumar et al. saw a strong correlation with \\nlong-term economic growth; Valatheeswaran and Khan noted the positive effects on the education of children \\nleft behind; and Agwu, Yuni, and Anochiwa found that remittances help close the gap between the lower and \\nmiddle income segments of society.\\nEmerging areas of study: immigrant entrepreneurship; climate migration, citiesAs we signal the economic bene˚ts of migration to destination societies, most thought has been given to \\nmigrants as employees. Less attention has been given to migrant entrepreneurs, but it appears that it is a \\ngrowing area of interest to scholars. Chavan and Taksa looked at Indian entrepreneurs with high human capital \\nlevels in Australia and suggested how policy could enhance even more their bene˚ts to the Australian economy. \\nICT entrepreneurs in Italy are the subject of Brzozwski, Cuccelelli, and Surdej™s exploration of transnational \\nentrepreneurship. Less happily are the fortunes of Somali entrepreneurs in South Africa whose presence is seen \\nas a threat, this forcing them to adopt specially-tailored defensive mechanisms. \\nIt is no surprise that more scholars are writing of climate migration, some with an emphasis on atoll island \\nstates whose very existence could be threatened by climate change. Yamamoto and Esteban look at migration \\npolicy as an adaptive response to the effects of rising sea levels on these states. In a ground-breaking study, \\nRahaman et al. looked at the health effects on climate migrants living in slums which may become even more \\ndensely populated in areas near to where climate change will bring about more urbanization.\\nCities are overwhelmingly the destination of most migrants and a great many articles refer to cities as a \\nmatter of course. One article from the last two years that received a great deal of attention was that by \\nBauder on Sanctuary Cities in which he compared self-described sanctuary cities in the United States, the \\nUnited Kingdom, and Canada and how they accommodate their undocumented populations. The concept of the \\nsanctuary city he found to be highly ambiguous, and he parses the concept in its different locations in the \\nsearch for commonalities and found that the ideas in one locale are often transferred to others whether by \\nmodern telecommunications or by travelling activists.\\nThis brief survey does not claim to offer a comprehensive account of the issues covered by \\nInternational \\nMigration™s\\n authors. Although there are evident common themes, our authors also presented innovations and \\ncovered less often seen themes including migrants in private militaries, brain drain from developed economies, \\nthe relationship between natural disasters and human traf˚cking, slave like conditions faced by migrants in \\nthe ˚shing industry, and the relationship between attitudes towards migrants and the willingness to accept \\nrisks in life. We appreciate the work that our authors have done to stimulate our collective thinking about \\ninternational migration, a subject of endless possibilities.\\n324International Migration Review\\n19 Chief Editors: Jamie Winders, Pieter Bevelander, Cynthia Feliciano, Filiz Garip and Matthew Hall\\nInternational Migration Review (IMR)\\n focuses on the interdisciplinary study of international migration. It \\npublishes 30 to 40 articles a year, along with shorter research notes and book reviews. Led by an interdisciplinary \\neditorial team from economics, sociology, and geography and guided by an international and interdisciplinary \\neditorial board, \\nIMR seeks to publish articles that both are grounded in rich empirics and push the boundaries \\nof how, where, and from what perspective we examine the complexities of international migration. The \\ninterplay between the two ‚I™ words associated with \\nIMR Œ interdisciplinary and international Œ guides what \\nwe, as editors, seek in publications. Among the manuscripts submitted to \\nIMR, we prioritize those that have \\nreach beyond speci˚c disciplines, perspectives, or methodological approaches and that situate their ˚ndings \\nvis-à-vis wider international trends. \\nA close examination of \\nIMR publications since 2016 (about 100 articles) identi˚es a number of trends.\\n20 First, \\nin terms of geography, around 80% of articles focus on North America or Western Europe, with a signi˚cantly \\nsmaller percentage focused on Asia (just over 10%) and an even smaller number on Latin America, the Middle \\nEast, or Africa. This uneven geographic coverage re˜ects one of the main shortcomings of migration studies \\nŒ limited attention to migration dynamics beyond North America and Western Europe. It also highlights the \\nchallenges that scholars writing about the wider geography of international migration face in attempts to \\nsituate their work in relation to hegemonic perspectives about two global regions. \\nSecond, if we look at the populations studied in \\nIMR, beyond a general focus on international migrants, \\nwe ˚nd equal attention to native-born and second-generation groups, a critical mass of articles focused on \\nimmigrant youth, but far less work on refugees. Thus, the issue of generation is central to \\nIMR articles, but the \\ndistinctions \\nand overlaps\\n between different kinds of migrants (i.e., skilled migrants, refugees, asylum-seekers, \\netc.) receive less analysis. Not surprisingly, much of the research on North America examines some aspect of \\nMexican migration, while much of the work on Western Europe analyzes the experiences of or attitudes toward \\nMuslim migrants, making these two groups Œ Mexican and Muslim migrants Œ the lens through which much \\nrecent scholarship has examined the complexities of international migration.\\nThird, methodologically, \\nIMR articles draw primarily on survey data, especially longitudinal administrative \\ndata and repeated survey data, approached in a range of ways. \\nIMR also publishes rich ethnographic studies, \\nif in smaller number, as well as work based on interviews and focus groups. Although not common, studies \\ndrawing on big data, satellite imagery, and ˚eld experiments round out a robust collection of methodologies \\nrepresented in the journal. Finally, \\nIMR publications address a diverse set of topics, from migrant welfare \\nto immigrant health and stereotypes, but broadly speaking, pay particular attention to immigration policy, \\npublic attitudes, education, family and household activities, wages and employment trends, legal status, and \\ngendered dynamics and ideologies.\\nBeyond this overall picture, what have been \\nIMR™s\\n key contributions since 2016? Here, we highlight a few \\nsuch contributions that, in our view, epitomize \\nIMR™s \\ngoal of pushing existing knowledge about international \\nmigration in a new or different direction. Some of that ‚pushing™ carries both a political and a policy component. \\nJean Beaman™s 2016 article on the second generation in France, for example, showed that the adult children of \\n19\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n325migrants from North Africa did not understand religious identity, especially Muslim identity, as incompatible \\nwith a French identity. Instead, these young adults saw themselves ‚as French as anyone else,™ thus challenging \\npublic and academic arguments about the mutually exclusive nature of religious and secular-national identity \\nin Europe.\\nIn a related policy vein, Marie-Laurence Flahaux (2017) looked at Senegalese return migration, ˚nding that \\nmigrants were less likely to return to Senegal when the possibility of re-entering the host county was slim. \\nAs Flahaux™s work suggests and as was corroborated in a study by Mathias Czaika and Hein de Haas (2017) of \\nglobal migration and visa data, migration restrictions tend to decrease circular migration and to make migrants \\nmore likely to settle permanently in the host country, giving the \\npolitical decision to tighten borders the \\nunintended policy outcome of transforming circular migration into permanent settlement.\\nOther \\nIMR articles jump into the interdisciplinary debate about assimilation, examining standard measures like \\nmarriage and language patterns, as well as less common measures, such as norms about body size (Altman, Van \\nHook and Gonzalez, 2017). Mieke Maliepaard and Richard Alba™s 2016 article on cultural integration among \\nchildren born to Muslim parents in the Netherlands examined this group™s gender norms, concluding that an \\nexplanation of either assimilation toward a Dutch norm or maintenance of ‚traditional™ gender views was too \\nsimplistic to understand this group™s complex, sometimes-contradictory gender ideologies and highlighting \\nthe need to disaggregate internal dynamics within ethnic communities. Ayumi Takenaka and her co-authors \\n(2016) took these ideas a step further in their examination of immigrant economic mobility in Japan. As they \\nnote, standard explanations of assimilation do not fully explain immigrant economic success or failure in \\nJapan, demonstrating the need for a more diverse geographic base for migration theories.\\nAnother key theme in \\nIMR publications is interpersonal contact. Benjamin Schulz and Lars Leszczensky™s 2016 \\narticle on friendship dynamics between native-born and immigrant youth in Germany found that among the \\nimmigrant backgrounds studied (Yugoslavian, Southern European, Turkish, and Polish), different relationships \\nbetween national identi˚cation with Germany and share of native friends emerged, driving home the need to \\ncritically interrogate group differences among immigrants. Judith Koops and her co-authors (2017) tweaked \\nthis model to study contact not only between ethnic minorities and the majority population but also \\namong\\n different immigrant groups, ˚nding different patterns between these two sets of dynamics and arguing for \\nattention to interactions among minority ethnic groups in the study of international migration.\\nAlthough many\\n IMR articles focus on the national scale, others make strong arguments for attention to local \\ndynamics. Andrew Felenon™s article (2017) analyzes health outcomes among Mexican immigrants in the United \\nStates, documenting a survival advantage among Mexican immigrants in new destinations and challenging \\nuniversal claims about immigrant enclaves™ protective health effects. Amrita Pande (2018) takes an even \\n˚ner-scaled approach in her study of domestic migrant workers in Lebanon, which argues for attention to the \\n‚intimate™ spaces of daily life which these migrant workers use to resist and complicate dominant images of \\ndomestic workers and their lived realities. \\nA number of IMR articles tackle foundational concepts like citizenship, examining how residential concentration \\nand naturalization rates are linked (Abascal 2017) or offering synthetic overviews of citizenship scholarship in \\nmigration studies (Bloemraad and Sheares 2017). Others grapple with popular concepts like ﬁcrisisﬂ in public \\ndiscourse around international migration, highlighting the political work such terms do while also showing \\nhow a ‚crisis™ might feel quite ordinary to migrants already experiencing chronic and slowly unfolding ‚crises™ \\nof their own (Bylander 2018).\\n326Moving forward, we hope that \\nIMR will continue to seek rigorous, innovative, and interdisciplinary research. \\nExpanding the geographic coverage of \\nIMR publications is a clear goal, as is attention to newer themes like \\nforced and climate-related migrations, the impact of new media in migrant experiences, and the incorporation \\nof data science into migration studies. As much as the detailed and thorough empirical research that sits at \\nIMR™s \\nheart remains a high priority, we also hope to see more agenda-setting pieces like Tomas Jimenez and his \\nco-authors™ recent discussion (2018) of the ﬁnext chapterﬂ in the study of assimilation. The interplay between \\nempirical investigation and theoretical engagement, between testing theories and proposing them, forms the \\ncore of interdisciplinary engagement and, we hope, will shape \\nIMR™s\\n trajectory until our next report.\\nJournal of Immigrant and Refugee Studies\\n21Chief Editor: Anna Triandafyllidou\\nThe JIRS is one of the few academic journals that has a double focus on both labour migrants and asylum \\nseekers/refugees, and a truly interdisciplinary focus that spans from social work and social policy, to migration \\nand ethnic studies, media and public discourses, to asylum policy and practice. The focus of the journal, \\noriginally North American, has now shifted to pay more attention to Europe but also Asia Paci˚c and to some \\nextent South and East Asia. There has been also a clear increase in recent years of articles focusing on the \\nMiddle East and particularly on Turkey, and the Syrian con˜ict. \\nThe contributions published in the journal can be organized along two main thematic axes.\\nThe ˚rst thematic axis brings together a variety of quantitative and qualitative approaches for studying migrant/\\nasylum seeker arrival, settlement, and integration processes. These include articles looking at resettlement \\npolicy and practice, and analyzing the work of non-governmental and governmental organisations and local \\nauthorities in providing arrival support and integration. Interestingly we have published articles that look at \\nthe challenges that social workers and civil society organisations face in their work but also papers that look \\nat the integration barriers that migrants and settled refugees face once at the destination country. There is \\nclearly a focus on the gender dimension and particularly on the challenges faced by women, but also on issues \\nof parenting and on the special integration and belonging challenges faced by youth.\\nThese research topics are valid across world regions and probably this is an important ˚nding in meta-analysing \\nimmigration related research. Thus for instance in 2018, we published papers on refugee resettlement in North \\nAmerica and Australia (ﬁMy world is upside downﬂ Transnational Iraqui Youth and Parent Perspectives on \\nResettlement in the United States; Integration or Building Resilience: what should the goal be in refugee \\nresettlement?; ) but also on how migrants activate their networks to ˚nd their place in their new home countries \\n(A grounded theory of Korean Immigrants™ experiences of re-establishing everyday activities in New Zealand; \\nA Study on Transnational Communication among Iranian Migrant Women in Australia; Negotiating Refugee \\nEmpowerment in Resettlement Organizations (in the USA); or ﬁAsking Aroundﬂ: Immigrants™ Counterstrategies \\nto renew their residence permit in times of economic crisis in Italy).\\nThe JIRS offers a unique virtual transnational space where different systems of reception and integration and \\ndifferent populations coming into the host countries under a variety of regimes (labour or family migrants, \\nasylum seekers or resettled refugees) may face similar challenges (including that of mental and physical \\n21\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n327health), learning the ropes in their new environment, activating their social capital resources, and eventually \\ncarving a place for themselves in their destination country, are discussed. The double background of the JIRS \\nfrom social work/community studies, and from sociology/ethnic studies pays well in bringing these different \\ntopics together. \\nThe second major topic that has occupied a salient position in our published research in both 2017 and 2018 is \\nthe governance of irregular migration and asylum seeking. During this period we published three special issues \\nthat actually develop different aspects of this theme.\\nOur second issue for 2017 was a Special Issue (guest editors, Alexandra Ricard-Guay, European University \\nInstitute, and Thanos Maroukis, University of Bath) focused on human traf˚cking in domestic work looking \\nat severely exploited migrant women domestic workers in different European countries. Contributions to this \\nspecial issue highlighted the gaps in human traf˚cking research that has focused typically on sex work \\noverlooking ‚shadow™ areas such as live-in domestic work, au-pairs turned into slaves, and pointed to the \\ngaps in national and European anti-traf˚cking legislation. Papers in this special issue showed how migrant \\ndomestic and care work is part and parcel of welfare systems in the ageing European societies and analysed \\nboth sociologically and legally the case of traf˚cking in domestic work. The ˚ndings highlighted how \\nloose conditions surrounding domestic and care work in private homes can lead to vulnerability and severe \\nexploitation. Indeed we could speak of a ‚slippery slope™ where migrant live-in workers are not aware of their \\nrights and families who employ them are not aware of their obligations while the state fails both to monitor \\nand control this sizeable labour market sector. Thus extra working hours and low payment, may slowly become \\nno payment at all, restriction of one™s privacy and liberty, severe physical and emotional abuse, thus raising a \\ncase of traf˚cking rather than simple exploitation. \\nDuring the same year we ran another special issue (guest editor Marie McAuliffe IOM research) focusing \\non irregularity and protection in southeast Asia. Building on the crisis in the Andaman sea in May 2015, \\ncontributions to this Special Issue pointed to the special features of irregular migration in southeast Asia \\nand most notably the reluctance or inability of several host and origin countries to register their minorities \\nand migrants and to provide them with a secure residence status. Indeed in southeast Asia the challenge of \\nirregular labour migration or asylum seeking is particularly complex as several minority groups and most \\nnotably the Rohingya face problems of statelessness. This Special Issue sadly coincided with the new Rohingya \\ncrisis in summer and fall 2017 when Myanmar engaged into an ethnic cleansing strategy in the Rakhine state \\nleading nearly 700,000 Rohingya to ˜ee to neighbouring Bangladesh.\\nThird but no less important, we ran in early 2018 a double special issue (guest editors Michal Krzyzanowski, \\nOrebro University, Anna Triandafyllidou, EUI, Ruth Wodak, University of Lancaster) analyzing the media \\ncoverage and political discourses on the Mediterranean ‚refugee emergency™ of 2014-2016. This special issue \\nfollowed an imaginary path of discourses from Greece west and north along the Balkan route, to Central, Nordic, \\nWestern and Eastern Europe. It looked at how the whole issue was presented in the media and particularly \\nhow it was debate in Parliaments, by party leaders or in of˚cial Twitter accounts. Interestingly comparing the \\nresults of our country cases we found signi˚cant convergence among a solidarity/humanitarian and control/\\nsecurity frame which were at odds with one another. This tension was however solved with a discursive framing \\nthat privileged viable and sustainable responses to the refugee ˜ows. Thus humanitarianism was brought \\ntogether with realism, with ‚rationality™ being emphasized as the key quality of speci˚c policy responses that \\naimed at reducing the ˜ows. The notion of crisis was present in all the different country discourses examined \\nand was used also among European countries to designate the ‚bad™ and ‚good™ Europeans.\\n328Indeed these three special issues re˜ect the salience of the governance of irregular migration and asylum \\nseeking issues not only among citizens and politicians but also within the academic community. The main \\ndifference of course between the two discourses (the public and the academic) being that the latter seeks to \\nprivilege in depth analysis that help us understand the causes, effects, dynamics of different phenomena, their \\nlegal and policy framework and of course the ways they can be portrayed as existential threats to the non-\\nmigrants or indeed as ethical and political obligations in building a fairer world.\\nInterestingly and perhaps re˜ecting the zeitgeist and the rise of both migrant/refugee ˜ows and of related \\nxenophobia and racisms, during these two years there has been in our journal a lesser attention to issues of \\nemployment or labour market integration or for instance on highly skilled migration or brain drain/brain \\ncirculation. Another thematic area that could attract more attention is intra-regional labour and asylum \\nrelated migration ˜ows and what is termed (perhaps erroneously) South-South migration.  \\nJournal on Migration and Human Security\\n22 Chief Editor: Donald KerwinIn 2013, the Center for Migration Studies of New York (CMS) established the \\nJournal on Migration and Human \\nSecurity (JMHS), an online, peer-reviewed, public policy publication. \\nJMHS draws on the knowledge, expertise \\nand perspectives of scholars, researchers, public of˚cials, faith communities, non-governmental organizations \\n(NGOs), business leaders and others. Its theme of human security is meant to evoke the widely shared goals of \\ncreating secure, sustaining conditions in migrant source communities; promoting safe, legal migration options; \\nand, allowing immigrants to lead productive, secure lives and to participate fully in their new communities. \\nWithout sacri˚cing academic and analytical rigor, \\nJMHS papers take a human-centered approach to migration \\nscholarship, focusing on (typically) at risk, vulnerable, and marginalized persons who are misunderstood \\nand often scapegoated in migration policy debates. \\nJMHS requires that each published paper begin with an \\nexecutive summary and end with a series of policy recommendations. This increases the accessibility of \\nJMHS papers to policymakers, policy in˜uencers, and the general public. JMHS promises potential authors that their \\nwork will be rigorously reviewed, published in a timely fashion (if accepted), and distributed through research \\nand university library databases, to \\nJMHS™s \\nextensive dissemination list, and to tailored lists of policymakers, \\nthe press and others with a special interest in the topic. \\nJMHS also publicizes its papers via social media, both \\nupon their release and subsequently in response to news hooks and relevant policy discussions.\\nMany \\nJMHS papers receive extensive media coverage and attention by policymakers. This has included a set of \\npapers Œ authored by Robert Warren and occasionally co-authored by Donald Kerwin Œ based on CMS estimates \\nof the US undocumented and other populations, derived from the US Census Bureau™s American Community \\nSurvey. This series has documented the falling US undocumented population, their characteristics, and the fact \\nthat most newly undocumented residents enter the United States legally and overstay their visas, rather than \\nillegally cross a border. The latter point Œ elaborated in several \\nJMHS papers Œ has been referenced in more \\nthan a hundred discrete media outlets since 2017 and has become a staple of the public debate on the Trump \\nadministration™s proposed US-Mexico border wall. \\n22\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n329JMHS has also published exhaustive pro˚les on other populations targeted by the Trump administration, \\nincluding potential DREAM Act bene˚ciaries (undocumented persons brought to the United States as children), \\nrefugees, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients, persons with a close family relationship to a US citizen \\nor lawful permanent resident (LPR) that would potentially qualify them for a visa, and long-term residents \\nwho may be eligible to naturalize. These papers Œ which illustrate the deep and longstanding ties of these \\ngroups to the United States Œ have garnered substantial attention from national and local government of˚cials, \\npolicymakers, academics, researchers, the business community, NGOs, and the press. Although extremist groups \\nand politicians occasionally dispute (without evidence) CMS™s estimates, the JMHS papers in this series offer a \\nfactual basis and rare common ground in the US immigration debate.\\nIn its short existence, \\nJMHS has proven to be an invaluable tool in addressing Œ whether through special \\ncollections or multiple papers on the same theme Œ public policy issues that raise human security themes. \\nIn 2016, for example, CMS hosted a three-day conference in anticipation of the UN Summit to Address Large \\nMovements of Refugees and Migrants. The Summit culminated in the New York Declaration for Refugees and \\nMigrants, which led to the adoption in 2018 of the Global Compact on Refugees and the Global Compact for \\nSafe, Orderly and Regular Migration.  The special collection of \\nJMHS resulting from its conference Œ entitled \\nStrengthening the Global Refugee Protection System\\n Œ informed these processes.  In particular, policymakers, \\nacademics and other leading authors contributed papers on:\\nŁ New frameworks for displaced persons not traditionally seen as meeting the international refugee \\nde˚nition (Susan Martin);\\nŁ Ethical perspectives on refugee protection (David Hollenbach, SJ);\\nŁ The challenge of inclusive communities (George Rupp);\\nŁ State responses to refugee in˜uxes, with a focus on Lebanon (Ninette Kelley);\\nŁ Refugee responsibility sharing (Volker Türk);\\nŁ Matching systems for refugees (Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym);\\nŁ Safe and voluntary repatriation (Jeff Crisp and Katy Long);\\nŁ The right to remain in one™s home community (Daniel Kanstroom);\\nŁ The externalization of migration controls (Bill Frelick, Ian Kysel and Jennifer Podkul); and deterrence \\nstrategies (Thomas Gammeltoft-Hansen and Nikolas F. Tan) as barriers to refugee protection;\\nŁ Migrant smuggling research (Gabriella Sanchez);\\nŁ Detention by non-state actors (Michael Flynn);\\nŁ The perspectives of Central American child migrants (Susan Schmidt);\\nŁ Lessons from the large-scale migration of Central American women and children (Karen Musalo and \\nEunice Lee); \\nŁ US refugee protection legislation (Tara Magner);\\nŁ National security and refugee protection as complementary imperatives (Donald Kerwin);\\nŁ Public opinion data (Brad K. Blitz);\\nŁ Variations in refugee economic outcomes (Alexander Betts, Naohiko Omata, and Louise Bloom);\\nŁ The need for egalitarian, redistributive, long-term development for refugees and their host communities \\n(Leah Zamore); and,\\nŁ Recommendations for the Global Compact on Refugees (Kevin Appleby). \\nThis special collection followed an earlier \\nJMHS collection consisting of 11 papers on reform of the US refugee \\nprotection system (\\nwrit large\\n) which commemorated the Refugee Act of 1980 on its 35th anniversary. More \\n330recently, in 2018, \\nJMHS published a study on how 1.1 million refugees who resettled in the United States \\nbetween 1987 and 2016 integrated and fared over time, compared to non-refugees, the foreign-born, and the \\noverall US population. \\nSince January 2017, \\nJMHS has extensively documented and critiqued the Trump administration™s immigration \\npolicies. In January 2018, \\nJMHS released a special collection of papers titled \\nThe US Immigration System: \\nPrinciples, Interests, and Policy Proposals to Guide Long-Term Reform\\n, which covered: \\nŁ The national interests and values that should guide long-term reform of the US immigration system \\n(Donald Kerwin);\\nŁ Nativism and US immigration policies (Julia G. Young);\\nŁ The future of citizenship (Peter J. Spiro);\\nŁ Immigration federalism (Cristina Rodriguez);\\nŁ The effectiveness of border enforcement (Edward Alden);\\nŁ Restoring the rule of law to the removal adjudication system (Lenni B. Benson); \\nŁ The merits of a subject-centered approach to legal non-compliance (Emily Ryo);\\nŁ Post-deportation barriers to family reuni˚cation (Deborah A. Boehm);\\nŁ The case for family unity (Zoya Gubernskaya and Joanna Dreby);\\nŁ Creating cohesive immigration policies (Pia O. Orrenius and Madeline Zavodny);\\nŁ Labor standards enforcement as an essential element of immigration reform (Janice Fine and Gregory \\nLyon);\\nŁ Economic development as an antidote to involuntary migration (John W. Harbeson);\\nŁ Possible directions for the US agricultural sector and workers (Philip Martin);\\nŁ The national interests served by US immigration policies, and how to replace an immigration system \\ncharacterized by illegality with robust legal immigration policies (Donald Kerwin and Robert Warren).\\nIn addition, a subsequent paper by Ruth Wasem examines the history of US immigration governance, identi˚es \\nthe many US immigration functions, and makes recommendations for reform.  \\nJMHS also produced a special collection devoted to the US immigration enforcement system, \\nThe Law That Begot \\nthe Modern US Immigration Enforcement System: IIRIRIA 20 Years Later\\n. This collection covers the consequences \\nof immigrant detention, criminal prosecution, and removal on deportees, US families and communities. It \\nincludes a study by Michael Coon on the impact of immigration enforcement by localities. More recently, \\nJMHS published a study on US deportees in Mexico and the family members of deportees remaining in the United \\nStates. This report has been the subject of substantial roll-out, public presentations, and Capitol Hill brie˚ngs. \\nImmigrant detention Œ both from a US and global perspective Œ has been regularly covered in \\nJMHS, most \\nrecently in an in˜uential paper on the privatization of detention by D. Gilman and L.A. Romero. CMS has \\nalso begun to publish a series of papers Š some of which will appear in \\nJMHS Š on the rule of law, access to \\njustice and due process in the US removal adjudication system. These papers are dedicated to Juan P. Osuna, \\nthe former Director of the Executive Of˚ce for Immigration Review (EOIR), which oversees the US immigration \\ncourt system.\\nWhile this short summary has highlighted special editions and thematic sets of papers, \\nJMHS also accepts \\nsubmissions on a range of issues which are poorly understood and often deliberately distorted in the public \\narena. The journal™s growth and vitality will also increasingly be tied to papers with greater geographic and \\n331topical diversity. To that end, JMHS has published important work on the negotiation process for the Global \\nCompact on Migration, wage and income inequality among farmworkers, forced labor and human traf˚cking \\naround the World Cup and other major sporting events, Europe™s anti-smuggling initiatives, and different \\nnational responses to the Syrian refugee crisis. At a time of rising nationalism and hostility toward immigrants, \\nJMHS plans to redouble its efforts to publish timely, fact-based, policy-relevant papers on human security \\nthemes. \\nMigration Studies23Chief Editor: Alan GamlenMigration Studies\\n is an international refereed journal dedicated to advances in theory, methodology and \\ncomparative research concerning all forms of human migration. Published by Oxford University Press, each \\nyear it receives around 200 submissions from 70-80 countries. After blind peer review through a global editorial \\nboard representing each major social science discipline and each major world region, \\nMigration Studies\\n publishes \\naround 20 full-length original research articles and half a dozen or so reviews of books, ˚lms and other media. \\nWe occasionally publish Research Notes and Special Issues. In 2017-18 the journal was included in the core \\njournal collection of Oxford University Press journals available to many libraries around the world, which \\nincreased its visibility. It was also assigned an of˚cial SSCI Impact Factor, a credential that lets professional \\nmigration researchers to trust the journal with their best research. \\nAdvances in theory, methods, and comparative data \\nIn 2017-18 Migration Studies\\n has covered most aspects of migration, from emigrant decision-making in origin \\nplaces; to processes of movement through complex regulatory systems; to dynamics of immigrant adaptation; \\nto practices of transnationalism. It has contributed to longstanding discussions on issues the relationship \\nbetween forced and free migration, and the role of gender in migration dynamics, and to major contemporary \\ndiscussion of the so-called ‚European migration crisis™, and the current evolution of a global regime to govern \\nmigration.\\nMigration research continues to focus heavily on the drivers of migration on one hand, and processes of \\nimmigrant adaptation on the other. In 2017-18, Migration Studies pushed forward scholarship on both fronts. \\nWe published several large-scale analyses on migration determinants. Matthew Hayes and Rocío Pérez-Gañán \\nexamined the under-researched case of NorthŒSouth lifestyle and retirement migration to Ecuador, while \\nMaryann Bylander compared two South-east Asian migration corridors, challenging the theory that ﬁthe poorest \\nof the poor are generally less likely to migrateﬂ, and exposing the importance of ﬁworker-borne costsﬂ and levels \\nof formalization of migration processes. Marie-Laurence Flahaux and Simona Vezzoli revealed that the closure \\nof formerly open Caribbean colonial borders caused a strong increase, not a decrease, in emigration Œ towards \\na wider array of other destinations. Speaking to abiding concerns about the ‚failure™ of migration policies to \\nimpact migration, Jan-Paul Brekke, Marianne Røed and Pål Schøne showed that restrictions during the 2015 \\nEuropean migration crisis both reduced asylum out˜ows and de˜ected them other countries. Examining the \\nintegration strategies of Iranian students in Western Europe, Ahmad Karimi and Sandra M Bucerius argued that \\nﬁthe processes of immigration and integration begin long before emigration actually takes placeﬂ. \\n23\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n332In 2017-18 we also showcased work on various forms of \\nimmigrant adaptation\\n, including several contributions \\nto longstanding debates on labor market incorporation. Sukanya Basu examined the wage-assimilation pro˚les \\nof ‚new™ and ‚old™ immigrant cohorts from Asian countries. Christel Kesler and Mirna Sa˚ compared barriers \\nto labor force participation and employment for immigrants France and the United Kingdom, while Ivana \\nFellini found that the European ‚crisis™ has changed the dominant patterns of labor of incorporation in Italy \\nand Spain. Karsten Paerregaard studied immigrant entrepreneurship amongst Peruvian migrants, while María \\nSánchez-Domínguez and Susanne Fahlén compared how different institutional contexts shape the ability of \\nimmigrant women in Spain and Sweden to move beyond and above ethnic niches.\\nWider processes\\n of immigrant reception and adaptation have also featured prominently. Several papers looked at \\nadaptation in terms of class and capital accumulation. Maja Cederberg showed the complexity of class positioning \\namong female migrants in the UK, and Suzanne Huot argued that immigrants experience ﬁmisrecognitionﬂ of \\ntheir social and human capital, which drives them into speci˚c occupations to compensate. Moving beyond \\neconomic outcomes, Silvia Maja Melzer and Ruud J. Muffels spoke to the growing literature on migration and \\nhappiness, using German panel data to examine subjective wellbeing in connection with east-west migration \\nafter reuni˚cation. In contributions to the literature on contexts of reception, Timothy B Gravelle examined \\nwhy Canadians hold closed vs open views towards refugees and immigrants, while Roy Germano demonstrated \\nthe use of video methods ﬁto promote empathy, reduce xenophobia, and illustrate concepts in the study of \\ninternational migrationﬂ.\\nMigration Studies \\nhas published groundbreaking studies on \\nprocesses of movement\\n itself, including how it is \\nregulated and shaped by policies at various levels. Cecilia Menjívar, Juliana E Morris and Néstor P Rodríguez \\nstudied the far-reaching consequences of deporting Honduran migrants, while Nora El Qadim explored the \\nsymbolic nature of visa policies between Morocco and Europe. Basia D Ellis and Henderikus J Stam revealed how \\nPolish migrants in Canada ﬁlearn to\\n become\\n ‚irregular™ﬂ, and Theresa Alfaro-Velcamp and colleagues exposed \\nthe underground market for immigrant papers in Cape Town. Marianne Takle focused on the contribution of \\nmigration statistics to the EU border control, and Sara Cosemans examined the phenomenon of post-colonial \\nEast African Asian diasporic refugees.   In a signi˚cant contribution to the literature on migration governance, \\nthe journal ran a full special issue on migration regimes in November 2017, guest edited by Kenneth Horvath, \\nAnna Amelina, and Karin Peters.\\nIn 2017-18 Migration Studies also showcased new work on the topic of \\ntransnationalism\\n that has dominated \\nmigration research in recent decades. For example, using Mexican data, Ana Isabel López García ascertained the \\nvarying effects of remittances on voter turnout in different migration contexts. Robtel Neajai Pailey studied \\nthe evolution of dual citizenship in Liberia, and Ali Chaudhary compared the transnational orientation of \\nPakistani immigrant organizations in London and New York. In a signi˚cant methodological contribution, \\nJohn Gibson and David McKenzie demonstrated the reliability of survey methods for researching remittances.\\nBuilding migration management capacity \\nThrough scholarship that is policy relevant but not policy driven, Migration Studies is one of a range of \\nacademic journals contributing to \\nbuilding migration management capacity\\n in communities and governments \\naround the world. The past several years have seen a worldwide proliferation of graduate programs and think \\ntanks specializing in migration issues. At the same time, the rising political salience of migration has created \\na growing need for policy makers, journalists and NGO professionals in other areas to gain working familiarity \\nwith migration issues. In view of these trends, in the past two years Migration Studies has run two series \\n333intended to contribute to the theory and practice of higher education on this topic. The ˚rst is a series called \\nTeaching Migration Studies\\n, involving brief descriptions and re˜ections on the professional practice of teaching \\nabout the topic in different parts of the world, written by senior scholars working in key graduate programs \\nthat prominently feature migration and related issues. The second series is entitled \\nClassics in Migration \\nStudies. Edited by Advisory Board member Robin Cohen, this series features reviews of canonical books and \\narticles in the history of migration scholarship, written by leading migration scholars from around the world. \\nThrough efforts like this, \\nMigration Studies \\nhas contributed to a growing international community of migration \\nexperts. As well as concerning themselves with social scienti˚c progress, many members of this community \\nare deeply engaged in public debates about migration, and are contributing to public life by informing and \\nimpacting the thoughts and decisions of politicians, policy makers and practitioners of migration policy at every \\nlevel, from local NGOs, to municipal governments, to national governments and international organizations. \\nWe are particularly pleased to have helped cultivate such community at a time when sound facts and rational \\narguments about migration are so urgently needed in public debates in so many countries. \\nChallenges aheadAs a journal, \\nMigration Studies\\n faces several challenges going forward. First is the need to connect with the \\ngrowing community of natural scientists studying migration using methods such as genomic analysis. These \\nmethods enable previously unimaginable insights about the nature and history of human migration, but also \\nraise profound ethical questions. As the ˚eld of genomic migration research develops, it should happen in \\ncloser dialogue with critical social scientists, who may help prevent the emergence of a new eugenics. \\nSecond, \\nMigration Studies\\n needs to engage more deeply with migration research in psychology and the health \\nsciences. Like the social sciences, these ˚elds increasingly feature migration research, but because of their \\ndisciplinary position they largely remain ships passing in the night. \\nThird, \\nMigration Studies\\n faces the ongoing challenge of balancing disciplinary rigor and interdisciplinarity \\nrelevance in an increasingly commercial academic environment. A major question facing all academic journals \\nis how to maintain scholarly standards as academic publishing continues to strain already-stretched researchers \\nby demanding their free labor Œ particularly as peer-reviewed outlets face competition for clicks from a vast \\narray of open source publications. \\nFinally, on a personal note, I would like to thank all the reviewers, authors, editors, advisors, production staff, \\npublishing team members, and everyone else involved, for the expertise, energy, and enthusiasm they have \\ncontributed to the journal not only in the past two years, but since our founding in 2013 Œ itself the result of \\nseveral years of collective preparation. It has been a great honor to lead the journal throughout this period, \\nand as I prepare to hand over the reins to the next editor at the end of 2019, I am proud to re˜ect on the \\ncontributions that the journal makes towards understanding one of the most important issues of our time. \\n334Refugee Survey Quarterly\\n24Chief Editor: Vincent Chetail\\nThe \\nRefugee Survey Quarterly\\n published 44 articles in 2017 and 2018, focusing on the challenges of forced \\nmigration from multidisciplinary and policy-oriented perspectives with a broad range of academic backgrounds \\n(such as sociology, political science, law, history, geography and economics). The diversity in scope and \\ncontent of these articles is the result of an editorial re-orientation of the journal undertaken since 2010. While \\nthe journal has been published by Oxford University Press since its creation in 1982, it was previously managed \\nby the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). During that time, the journal primarily \\npublished bibliographies and of˚cial documents on the protection of refugees, especially those produced by \\nUNHCR. It then included as well special issues dedicated to a particular theme and guest edited by experts in \\nthe relevant area. \\nWhen UNHCR pulled out of the journal in 2010, the \\nRefugee Survey Quarterly\\n experienced a major turnaround \\nto become a genuine academic publication and, today, a reference journal in the ˚eld of forced migration. \\nIn addition to the establishment of a rigorous blind peer review process, the journal started to welcome \\nsubmissions on an ongoing basis. An editorial strategy was also put in place to diversify the scope and content \\nof articles to better re˜ect the rapid developments in the ˚eld of refugee protection. This strategy has borne \\nfruit as illustrate the articles published in 2017 and 2018. \\nFirst, the objective has been to broaden the geographical scope of submissions. Prior to 2010, articles tended to \\npredominantly focus on refugee issues in the Global North, especially in Europe. A larger geographical coverage \\nwas thus needed to better account for the obstacles raised to international refugee protection worldwide. It is \\nwell-known indeed that the vast majority of refugees are hosted in the Global South, while some States have \\nemerged as new destination countries for the past decades. In addition to articles on Africa which are regularly \\npublished in the \\nRefugee Survey Quarterly\\n, the 2017 and 2018 contributions included papers on Lebanon, \\nJordan, Egypt, Syria and the Gulf countries, as well as on Latin America, such as El Salvador, Mexico and Brazil. \\nParticular efforts were also made in the past years to attract articles on Asia which tends to be underrepresented \\nin the refugee literature. These efforts seem to have responded to a real need from readers as one of the articles \\npublished in 2018 and focusing on China has gathered almost 5,000 views and downloads at the time of writing \\n(see L. Song, ﬁChina and the International Refugee Protection Regime: Past, Present, and Potentialsﬂ, in Vol. \\n37(2), 2018, pp. 139-161; in open access). Despite the diversi˚cation of the journal™s geographical scope, the \\nRefugee Survey Quarterly \\nof course continues to publish articles on more ﬁtraditionalﬂ regions of asylum, such \\nas North America and Europe. \\nSecond, the editorial strategy for the past years has also been to widen the thematic focus of the journal. \\nDespite its name, the \\nRefugee Survey Quarterly\\n is not only about refugees. It is more generally concerned by \\nall aspects relating to forced migration. Beyond more traditional questions of resettlement, protection or \\nhumanitarian assistance, the 2017 and 2018 contributions notably cover issues related to statelessness and \\ninternally displaced persons. Contributions also tackle the question of protection against climate change and \\ndisaster (see B. Burson, W. Kälin, J. McAdam and S. Weerasinghe, ﬁThe Duty to Move People Out of Harm™s Way \\nin the Context of Climate Change and Disasters, Vol. 37(4), 2018, pp. 379-407), as well as gender, displacement \\n24\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n335and peacebuilding (see K.E. Atkinson, ﬁPolicy and possibilities of humanitarian development: Displaced Women \\nand Peace-Building Features of the UNHCRﬂ, Vol. 37(4), 2018, pp. 408-439; freely available).\\nThe content of the \\nRefugee Survey Quarterly\\n has also logically broadened as asylum and migration have \\nbecome increasingly blurred in the past decades in both policy and practice. For instance, the special issue \\non ﬁ‚Undesirable and Unreturnable™ Aliens in Asylum and Immigration Lawﬂ tackles the question of asylum-\\nseekers refused international protection for security reasons, but who are nonetheless unreturnable to their \\ncountry of origin, especially due to the protection afforded by the principle of \\nnon-refoulement \\n(guest edited \\nby D.J. Cantor, J. van Wijk, S. Singer and M.P. Bolhuis, Vol. 36(1), 2017). The securitization of asylum was \\nalso the subject of other contributions, especially from the perspective of detention and its disastrous effects \\non asylum-seekers, alongside articles on the impact of border controls on refugee protection. The limits and \\ndangers inherent to such a security approach are well exempli˜ed by several case studies focusing on Australia, \\nCanada and European States. Another interesting contribution analyses refugee policy in the United States as \\na re˚ection of its foreign policy when it comes to the resettlement of Iraqi and Afghan refugees (N.R. Micinski, \\nﬁRefugee Policy as Foreign Policy: Iraqi and Afghan Refugee Resettlements to the United Statesﬂ, Vol. 37(3), \\n2018, pp. 253-278). \\nWhile the thematic coverage of the journal will continue to evolve with the new developments in forced \\nmigration, the \\nRefugee Survey Quarterly\\n will remain dedicated to publish high quality and original articles on \\nissues of both academic and policy interest. In this regard, the journal is thankful to peer reviewers who have \\nkindly offered their time and expertise, despite the increasingly demanding workload entailed by academic \\npositions. One of the main challenges for the years to come will be to further diversify the geographical origin \\nof contributors to the \\nRefugee Survey Quarterly\\n. While efforts have been made in this sense in the past years, \\nsubmissions are still dominated by scholars from the Global North. This is not peculiar to the \\nRefugee Survey \\nQuarterly, but more broadly re˚ects the prevailing biases in academic research and publications. \\nIn this ˜eld like in many others, the production of knowledge remains largely structured by the Western-centric \\npriorities of research funding that is ˜nanced by wealthy states and fuelled by the dominant discourse of the \\ngoverning elites. This trend is further exacerbated by the enduring misperceptions spread by mass media, as \\nillustrated by the rhetoric Œ if not the obsession Œ about the so-called refugee crisis in Europe. While it may \\nhave less implications in other ˜elds, the geographical representation of researchers is particularly crucial \\nin migration to account for the multifaceted dimensions and challenges of such a worldwide phenomenon \\nthat concerns every region of the world. There is more than ever a vital need for developing a more nuanced, \\nrepresentative and comprehensive understanding of migration through independent and evidence-based \\nknowledge.\\nInternational Journal of Migration and Border Studies\\nChief Editor: Dr. Idil Atak\\nInternational Journal of Migration and Border Studies (IJMBS)\\n is a peer-reviewed journal which offers a forum for \\ndisciplinary and inter-disciplinary research concerning conceptual, theoretical, empirical and methodological \\ndimensions of migration and border studies. The journal brings together a diverse range of international \\nscholars and practitioners to advance knowledge and improve practice. Over the past two years, the IJMBS \\ncontributions spanned many geographic regions and countries documenting and critically analysing migration \\n336and border policies and practices as well as the experiences of migrants. IJMBS contributed knowledge in \\nthree interrelated areas, in particular: the criminalisation of migrants; borders as sites of deterrence and \\ncontainment; and strategies to promote mobility and the human rights of migrants. \\nThe criminalisation of migrantsThe IJMBS contributions typically dealt with the current global and national contexts where migrants™ \\nmobility has been constrained by restrictive measures. States have resorted to the criminalisation of migration \\nor crimmigration to deter and to punish asylum seekers and irregular migrants. The process involves an \\nincreased reliance on the criminal law to enforce im\\n migration statutes. Violations of immigration law carry \\ncriminal consequences without the implementation of procedural protections applicable to criminal law. \\nProblematic measures include arbitrary detentions, enhanced surveillance practices, interception strategies \\nand deportations. States have also tightened the criteria for granting refugee status with a view to limiting \\nthe number of persons granted asylum with the pretext of deterring ‚abuse™. Against this background, IJMBS \\nexplored important theoretical and empirical implications associated with crimmigration and how this \\nphenomenon is constructed and challenged in diverse settings. To illustrate, a historical lens was used in a \\ncontribution to examine the ideological roots pertaining to the Belgian policy of migrants™ deportation. Such \\nan approach demonstrated how framing the foreigner as an unethical subject legitimised the exceptional power \\nof deportation. Similarly, several authors adopted a comparative perspective to illuminate the commonalities \\nbetween histories, rationales, and implementation of criminalizing policies in different jurisdictions. One \\nsuch example is the safe country of origin criteria used in refugee status determination both in the European \\nUnion (EU) and in Canada as a tool to delegitimize certain refugee claims and to reduce the number of \\n‚undesirable™ asylum seekers. \\nA common theme across contributions is the impact of crimmigration on the human rights of migrants. Take \\nthe Canadian immigration detention regime where there are no clear statutory time limits or meaningful \\nindependent oversight. This situation clearly aggravates the risk for arbitrary and inhumane detention \\nof migrants. The United States President Donald Trump™s travel bans offer another illustration of how \\ncrimmigration violates individual rights like the right to privacy and the presumption of innocence. In \\naddition, these travel bans require states to provide information relating to their citizens and resident \\nforeigners to the United States authorities in return for being left off the list of banned countries. Indeed a \\nnumber of contributions in IJMBS highlighted that migration management has become a major dimension of \\ninterstate relations. Destination countries increasingly cooperate with source and transit countries to enable \\nthem to ef˜ciently control their borders and contain irregular migrants. Often characterised by an imbalance \\nof power between states, the externalisation of migration controls has been detrimental to migrants™ rights as \\nexempli˜ed in the case of smuggled asylum seekers in Indonesia. The ‚illegality™ of this population has been \\nconstructed as a result of Indonesia™s enhanced cooperation with Australia. This had a transformative effect \\nnot only on Indonesian law but also on social attitudes towards asylum seekers in this country. Arrangements \\nwith third-countries are also part of the current \\ndebates\\n at the EU level, with the aim to con˜ne refugees \\nin countries outside or on the periphery of the EU\\n. \\nIn some instances, the strategic alliances between states \\nwere embedded in systems of reciprocal conditionalities. An example is the proactive engagement of North \\nAfrican and Sahel countries in the EU™s immigration control efforts. This engagement was largely motivated \\nby these countries™ own interests and expectations from the EU, such as military assistance, ˜nancial support \\nand regime legitimacy. \\n337Exclusionary borders and transit migration\\nBorders are complex spaces that involve discursive, spatial, and temporal dimensions. The evolving nature \\nof borders has been a main focus for IJMBS which systematically examines how border controls operate \\nin practice. As highlighted in a contribution, border of˚cials are confronted with tasks that entail both \\ndiscretionary decision-making and coercive measures where they have to balance a professional ethos with \\ntheir personal moral values. \\nMany IJMBS articles examined the shifting conception of borders as tools of governance and as boundaries \\nof belonging. A perfect illustration is the ‚anticipatory interdiction™ measures implemented by Canada to \\nmanage the geopolitical ‚threat™ posed by asylum claimants from Mexico. Measures such as the United States-\\nCanada Safe Third Country Agreement, the Mexican visa imposition, and the safe country of origin scheme \\nformed a virtual border to effectively ˚lter and exclude migrants from Mexico. In a similar vein, the EU border \\ncontrol regime generated exclusion and precarity of migrants during the so-called ‚European refugee crisis™ in \\n2015. As an IJMBS contribution put it, when over a million people reached Europe, intense political debate \\non the ‚crisis™ has prevented public opinion from seeing how its root causes lie in the intrinsic weaknesses \\nof the solidarity and responsibility sharing mechanisms in the EU. Indeed another article argued that the \\nEU™s political priority to counter migrant smuggling affected the provision of humanitarian assistance and \\naccess to rights for irregular immigrants and asylum seekers. Civil society actors, especially those critically \\nmonitor and politically mobilise for the rights of migrants in Europe, have faced prosecutions and criminal \\nconvictions when assisting this population. Authors pointed almost invariably to the pressing issue of \\nensuring transparency and accountability at the border.\\nThe IJMBS contributed to the understanding of how the logics of borders are confronted by migrant realities \\nand everyday experiences. Research has documented the increasingly protracted nature of migrants™ journeys. \\nBeing in transit has become the daily lived reality of many people on the move. Accordingly, special attention \\nwas paid by IJMBS to the concept of transit as a space constructed through mobility restrictions regimes and \\nthe above-mentioned systems of reciprocal conditionalities. In particular, there has been a mounting pressure \\non the ˚rst countries of asylum to double efforts to locally integrate refugees they are hosting. However \\nthese countries struggle to meet the social and economic needs of refugees who often face discrimination. \\nAs described in an article, the desire to move on with their lives and escape the interminable temporariness \\nin Turkey propelled some Syrian refugees to engage in secondary movements throughout the EU, despite \\nthe risks of the journey. For similar reasons, the vast majority of one million refugees who landed in Greece \\nand Italy in 2015-2016, then engaged in secondary movements to escape the temporary status and the \\nexploitative economies of transit. Another contribution shed light on the situation of asylum seekers con˚ned \\nin Indonesia and who hope to be resettled in Australia. It demonstrated that limbo in transit encouraged \\nmigrants to agree to assisted voluntary return, in many cases, to places where they may face persecution. \\nMigrant agency, the limits of resistance and the way forward\\nThe resilience and the agency of migrants are among priority topics explored in IJMBS. As demonstrated in \\none of the contributions, young temporary migrants from China and Hong Kong, China in the United Kingdom \\nhave been able to deploy strategies such as marriage and the use of sexual capital to prolong their stay in \\nthis country. In other cases, migrants can manage their own migration trajectories through resourceful use of \\nnew technologies. Mobile technology can serve to shape routes, destinations and facilitate the ˚nancing of \\nirregular migration. Sadly the IJMBS contributions also show the limits of resistance and the ways in which \\n338migrant agency is harnessed by the state to justify further migration controls and denial of protection. A \\ntypical example is the precarious situation of unaccompanied minors who travelled from Mexico and Central \\nAmerica to the United States in 2014. The framing of children as ‚illegal migrants™ by the United States and \\nMexican authorities allowed increased deportations. As well, border controls were implemented under the \\nguise of assisting minors, who were cast as agentless victims. \\nMany of the IJMBS articles touched on the counterproductive effects of border control regimes. In addition \\nto the migrants™ human rights violations, the proliferation of migrant smuggling and human traf˚cking had \\nbeen a by-product of these regimes. As emphasized by an author, a meaningful attempt to address migrant \\nsmuggling requires states to develop legal and safe avenues for accessing countries of asylum. Indeed, the \\n2016 New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants called on states to ensure safe, orderly and regular \\nmigrations. The recent global compacts signal a move towards more inclusive and principled approaches to the \\ngovernance of human mobility. As the Global Compact on Refugees underlined it, refugee resettlement policies \\nare of key importance in this respect. An IJMBS special issue contributed to the debate by comparing and \\ncontrasting refugee resettlement in four major receiving countries: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the \\nUnited Kingdom. Policies were examined in several key areas of settlement support, including employment, \\nhealthcare, education, social welfare and social security. The issue offered an in-depth discussion on whether \\nand to what extent resettlement policies are adequate. It also critically analysed the policy variance among \\nstates and between areas of settlement policy. Policy recommendations formulated in the contributions inspire \\nconstructive change and inform policy makers and other stakeholders in the countries studied and globally. \\nImportantly, a comparative analysis of resettlement policies shows that more solidarity with refugees and \\ncountries in the global South that are currently hosting them is possible. \\nOverall, the research published in IJMBS functions as a plea for the facilitation of human mobility across \\nborders. It dispels the myth that migration can be regulated by deterrence-based policies. Contributions \\nprovide evidence that such policies are counterproductive and highlight the need for an effective human \\nrights-based global framework that would enhance mobility.\\nRevue Européenne des Migrations Internationales\\n25Chief Editors: Emmanuel Ma Mung and Véronique PetitThe \\nEuropean Review of International Migration\\n (REMI) is a specialised journal on international migration \\nand inter-ethnic relations. Multidisciplinary (sociology, anthropology, demography, geography, history, \\npolitical science, etc.), it publishes in French, English and Spanish in-depth articles of empirical or theoretical \\norientation, as well as research notes that present the ˚rst results of ongoing research. Each review number \\nincludes a thematic issue which is supplemented by varia. A legal chronical since 2016 takes into account the \\ngrowing importance of legal issues related to international migration and migration policy issues. This reborn \\nchronical is moderated by a group of specialised lawyers who are developing a network around issues such as \\ninternational migration law (conventions, protocols), reception and protection conditions for unaccompanied \\nminors, protection and promotion of the social rights of migrants, human rights as protection of migrants™ \\nrights, access to health, labour law for irregular migrants.\\n25\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n339REMI celebrated its 30th anniversary by publishing a special issue entitled ﬁRenewing the Migration Issuesﬂ \\n(32/3-4 2016). This special volume brought together original and diversi˚ed contributions. In addition to \\nthe classic articles, this issue features interviews with journal editors, researchers and artists. Through these \\nexchanges, the function of scienti˚c journals in a rapidly changing world of publishing and research, the use \\nof categories and concepts in understanding migration issues and inter-ethnic relations, as well as the place \\nof migration in multicultural societies are examined. Other articles deal with epistemological challenges by \\nreporting on survey methods in an urban context (use of photography, sound recordings), the measurement \\nof migratory ˜ows, the mapping of migratory ˜ows, the museography of migratory histories. Other articles \\nanalyse more current and topical situations: the United States™ migration policy and the revival of the ﬁSilk \\nRoadﬂ between Asia and Europe. \\nThe issue of violence is a recurring theme in the latest dossiers. The importance of this issue re˜ects the \\ntragic consequences of migration policies in particular contexts or crises, and the emergence of work around \\nmigrants™ journeys. The dossier ﬁSpeaking out against border violence. Putting into words migration to Europeﬂ \\n(33/2-3, 2017) coordinated by Cécile Canut and Anaïk Pian addresses border violence by adopting a language \\napproach. Considering language practices as an integral part of migration practices in the context of migration \\nto Europe, the articles analyse how the actors put into words death and violence at borders. Death is considered \\nin multiple dimensions: social death, physical death, disappearance, institutional and security arbitrariness, \\netc. These language practices are understood at different sociological and political levels, whether it is their \\nproduction from institutional spaces (international organisations, political spaces at European or state level) \\nor their reception by migrants, during their life in Europe or afterwards when they arrive there, or when they \\nreturn to their country after an expulsion. The language approach, corresponding both to a consideration of \\nthe discourses produced on migrants and of the narratives taken by migrants in plural discursive frameworks. \\nThis perspective makes it possible to think of the border object while offering a grid for interpreting socio-\\nspatial inequalities in the era of globalization.\\nThe issue of violence and migration routes is also addressed through the refugee situation. Karen Akoka, \\nOlivier Clochard and Albena Tcholakova in the dossier ﬁRecognised refugees and after? ﬁ (33/4, 2017) question \\nthe fate of refugees once they have obtained this status. Indeed, they start from the observation that research \\non recognised refugees remains too rare in studies on asylum conditions in Europe. The vast majority of \\nacademic work focuses on the situation of candidates for refugee status before their application is recognised \\nor rejected. The articles presented in this dossier examine this ﬁafterﬂ time. They question the widespread \\nimage that makes refugee status a kind of outcome and invite us to question its effects in terms of social, \\nidentity and political recon˚gurations. Different case studies, referring to different populations and periods \\n(Armenians, Africans, Cambodians, Tamils) shed light on the refugee status as an individual and collective \\nexperience.\\nThe experience of exile and life after it is also examined in the dossier ﬁLiving, thinking, writing in exileﬂ \\n(33/1, 2017) coordinated by the historian Ralph Schor, who strives to understand the paths and identity \\nchoices of a particular category of exiles: writers and thinkers. Many of them left their homeland, voluntarily \\nin the case of those on an unprecedented intellectual adventure, or forced in the case of political refugees. \\nArticles in history or social science describe the living conditions of writers far from their country in order to \\nunderstand the formation and expression of their thought. Some authors articulate a double corpus: discursive \\ndata from interviews with authors and migrants of the same origin, and a corpus constructed from their \\nliterary works. These articles examine the literary and anthropological writing of migration, the narrative of \\noneself and others, the expression of emotions and feelings, and the viewer™s perspective. Some varia articles \\n340focus on the links between ˜lm and migration experiences in countries with a ˜lm industry. In what way \\ndo cinema and photography open up new discursive spaces? A special richly illustrated dossier is devoted to \\nthe links between photography, migration and cities (32/3-4, 2016). How cinema and photography re˚ect \\nmigrants™ migratory experiences, imaginations, living, housing and working conditions? These articles also \\nshow how images contribute to current events and the production of memory, instilling emotions, re˚ections, \\nmobilizations and denunciations.\\nContemporary situations are also examined through the lens of history, which makes it possible to grasp \\nruptures and continuities and to develop comparative perspectives. This was the case in the dossier on \\nﬁRomanian Roma migration in Europe: inclusion policies, strategies for distinguishing and (de)building identity \\nbordersﬂ coordinated by Mihaela Nedelcu and Ruxandra-Oana Ciobanu (32/1, 2016). It is also the perspective \\nadopted in the dossier ﬁMigratory movements of yesterday and today in Italyﬂ coordinated by Paola Corti and \\nAdelina Miranda (34/1, 2018) which critically reviews Italy™s migratory history, at a time when this country \\nis becoming increasingly present on the international scene due to policies of refoulement of foreigners at \\nnational borders. The analysis of the Italian case suggests, in the wake of the migration studies, that it is not \\npossible to de˜ne the migration ˜elds within which old and new protagonists move through the simple analysis \\nof territorial trajectories. The research presented shows, on the one hand, that the adoption of a distant \\nperspective is essential to relativize current analyses and, on the other hand, it shows the heuristic interest in \\nvarying the focus of the historical perspective on migration facts. Similarly, since it is no longer conceivable \\nto use categories that semantically re˚ect the typologies used by a political discourse that instrumentalize \\nthem, it is useful to consider the various spatial-political scales - local, regional, national and international \\n- while appropriating the subjective level to understand the complexity of the phenomenon. This historical \\nperspective is also present in the dossier ﬁTraining elites: mobility of students from Africa north of the Sahara \\nin the countries of the former socialist blocﬂ coordinated by Michèle Leclerc-Olive and Marie-Antoinette Hily \\n(32/2, 2016), which sheds light on a forgotten part of our history, examines collaboration between countries \\nin the name of an ideological project, and the ﬁquali˜ed migrationﬂ that these programmes generate between \\nthese States. The presentation of these experiences leads to a discussion of the descriptive categories of these \\nﬁmobilitiesﬂ and ﬁelitesﬂ.\\nFinally, the last dossier ﬁMental health in international migrationﬂ (34/2-3, 2018) coordinated by Véronique \\nPetit and Simeng Wang is the ˜rst dossier that REMI has devoted to mental health. It is published at a time \\nwhen migration policies in France and Europe, due to their deleterious effects, are undermining the rights, \\naccess to healthcare and health of many migrants. Articles provide empirical researches describing the use \\nof care and therapeutic relationships in mental health for migrants at different points in their migration \\nroute. The mental health perspective renews the reading of the social relationships in which the migrant is \\ninserted. It also makes it possible to analyse the social conditions of production, expression and management \\nof psychological suffering at the micro, meso and macro- social levels. The methods of care (institutional, \\nsocial, legal, health) for migrants diagnosed ﬁas having mental disorders, psychological dif˜culties or in a \\nstate of sufferingﬂ link the effects of migration policies, the dynamics of reception and care of migrants, the \\norganisation of care systems and the production of subjectivities and self-expression.\\n341Chapter 6Appendix A. Terms and definitions relating to migrants™ inclusion and social cohesion\\nVarious terms have been used to refer to migrants™ inclusion in receiving societies and to social cohesion. The \\nchoice of one particular term depends on the interlocutor (who/which stakeholder), the particular period of \\ntime (when), and the historical, political, social, cultural and economic contexts of a particular host country \\nor society (where). \\nThe table below provides an illustration of some of the terms often used, together with a potential de˚nition. \\nThese de˚nitions are, however, only suggestions as to how these terms can be understood, as no universally \\nagreed de˚nitions exist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n342\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n343\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n\\n344Appendix B. The legal framework of migrants™ inclusion \\nAs introduced in chapter 6, the different key policy areas of migrants™ inclusion correspond to and are \\ngrounded in some speci˚c rights to which all individuals are entitled, including migrants. The ˚gure in this \\nappendix provides an overview of some of the rights that are essential for migrants™ inclusion. \\nAll these rights are based on speci˚c international treaties, especially those part of international human \\nrights law and international labour law. Without prejudice to other relevant international and regional \\ninstruments, these treaties include: \\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile these treaties are only legally binding for the States that have rati˚ed them, the two Covenants of \\n1966 have now been rati˚ed by virtually all States.\\n26 Moreover, some of the rights in the ˚gure below are \\ncommonly recognized to be part of customary international law. They are thus legally binding on all States, \\nirrespective of their rati˚cation of speci˚c treaties or conventions. These customary rights most notably \\ninclude the main pillar of migrants™ inclusion: that is, the principle of non-discrimination, which ensures that \\nthe rights of all individuals, including migrants, are not nulli˚ed or impaired on the basis of ﬁrace, colour, \\nsex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other statusﬂ, \\nincluding migration status.\\n27 26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n345\\n\\n\\n˙˜\\n\\n˝ˆ\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nˇ˜\\n\\n\\n\\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆ˙ˇˆ˜˙ˆ\\n˘\\n\\n˝˘˚˜ˆ\\n˜\\n˜\\n˙\\n\\nˇ˜ˆˆ\\n\\n\\n˜ˆ\\n\\n\\nˇ˜ˆ\\n\\n˜˚˛˝˙ˆ\\nˇ˘˝\\n\\n\\n\\n346Appendix C. Main findings of the Immigrant Citizens Survey \\nThe \\nImmigrant Citizens Survey\\n28 was piloted by the King Baudouin Foundation and the Migration Policy \\nGroup, and conducted in 2011Œ2012 with 7,473 migrants born outside the European Union and residing in 15 \\ncities in seven EU member States. Survey questions concerned six dimensions of inclusion, resulting in the \\nfollowing key ˚ndings:\\n1. Employment \\nŁ Problems on the labour market are often local, from few legal contracts in Southern Europe to \\ndiscrimination and distrust of foreign quali˚cations in Northern Europe. \\nŁ For immigrants, the major problem is job security. \\nŁ 25Œ33% of working immigrants feel overquali˚ed for their job. \\nŁ Educated immigrants often get their foreign quali˚cations recognised if they apply, but few \\napply. \\nŁ Most working-age immigrants want more training. \\nŁ Immigrants have greater problems balancing training, work, and family life than most people do \\nin the country. \\n2. Languages \\nŁ Immigrants generally speak more languages than the average person in their country of residence. \\nŁ For immigrants Œ like for most people Œ time is the major problem for learning a new language. \\nŁ Getting information on learning opportunities may be more dif˚cult for immigrants than general \\npublic. \\nŁ Wide range of immigrants participated in language or integration courses. \\nŁ Participants highly value courses for learning language and often for socio-economic integration. \\n3. Political and civic participation\\nŁ Most immigrants are interested in voting (often as much as nationals are). \\nŁ Most immigrants want more diversity in politics Œ and many are willing to vote in support of it. \\nŁ Immigrants™ broader participation in civic life is uneven from city to city and organisation to \\norganisation. \\nŁ Whether immigrants know or participate in an immigrant NGO depends heavily on their local and \\nnational context.  \\n4. Family reunion\\n Ł Only limited numbers of ˚rst-generation immigrants were ever separated from a partner or \\nchildren. \\n\\n347Ł The majority of separated families have already reunited in most surveyed countries. \\nŁ Most separated immigrants today do not want to apply for their family, some because of family \\nchoices but others because of policy obstacles. \\nŁ Family reunion helps immigrants improve family life, sense of belonging and sometimes other \\nintegration outcomes. \\n5. Long-term residence\\n Ł 80Œ95% of immigrants are or want to become long-term residents. \\nŁ Most temporary migrants in new countries of immigration also want to become long-term \\nresidents. \\nŁ The average person applies not long after the minimum period of residence. \\nŁ Documents and powers of authorities cited as major problems for applicants in certain countries. \\nŁ Long-term residence helps most immigrants get better jobs and feel more settled. \\n6. Citizenship Ł Around 3 out of 4 immigrants are or want to become citizens. \\nŁ The few uninterested in citizenship often either do not see the difference with their current \\nstatus or face speci˚c policy obstacles. \\nŁ Major reasons not to naturalise are dif˚cult procedures in France and restrictions on dual \\nnationality in Germany.\\nŁ Naturalisation more common among established immigration countries and among facilitated \\ngroups in Hungary and Spain. \\nŁ Immigrants who are eligible for naturalization often take years to apply. \\nŁ Citizenship helps immigrants feel more settled, get better jobs, and even get more educated and \\ninvolved. \\nSource:\\n \\n\\n\\n348Chapter 7Appendix A.

Lessons learned in advancing a National Migration Health Policy and action \\nframework in Sri LankaSustained economic growth and peace dividends since the cessation of protracted civil con˜ict in 2009 has \\nre-established Sri Lanka as a booming economy in the South Asian region. International migration continues \\nto be a catalyst to Sri Lanka™s development. Sri Lanka is both a labour-sending country (with over 2 million \\nof its citizens working abroad as labour migrants), and a labour-receiving one Œ with a growing number of \\nmigrant workers from countries such as India and China arriving to work on large-scale infrastructure projects \\nsuch as new highways, seaports and airports. These developments will further increase population mobility \\ninto and within the island.  The end of war also led to a return of Sri Lankan refugees from India, with many \\nmore internally displaced persons from other parts of the country, to their places of origin. Addressing health \\nchallenges of a dynamic range of population ˜ows therefore becomes important. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommissioned research studies on inbound, outbound, internal migraon, including health impacts on lebehind migrant families.

The process was led by the Ministry of Health with technical partnership from IOM. Sri Lanka \\nremains one of the few countries to have a dedicated National Migration Health Policy and Action Plan, which \\nwas launched in 2013.\\nSix key lessons in advancing the National Migration Health Policy \\n1. Adopt an intersectoral, participatory approach\\nAn interministerial mechanism was established, led by the Minister of Health, to galvanize the migration \\nand health agenda. The multisectoral coordination framework is comprised of three elements: (a) a dedicated \\nsecretariat within the Directorate of Policy and Planning to drive daily coordination; (b) a National Migration \\nHealth Taskforce (MHTF) to drive technical cooperation; and (c) a National Steering Committee to drive legal \\nand executive level action. The MHTF enabled participation from civil society, the nongovernmental sector, \\nacademia and intergovernmental organizations, and migrants themselves.\\n2. Adopt an inclusive approach\\nAfter extensive deliberation, the MHTF targeted migrant categories across all three migration ˜ows: inbound, \\noutbound and internal. Inbound migrants include foreign migrant workers and returning refugees; outbound \\nmigration encompasses categories such as labour migrants, international students and military; and internal \\nmigrants include categories such as free trade zone workers, seasonal workers and internally displaced persons. \\nConsidering the large numbers of migrant workers, the left-behind children and families of international \\nmigrant workers were included as a dedicated fourth section for the policy.\\n3. Adopt a strong ﬁevidence-informed approachﬂ\\nA hallmark of Sri Lanka™s policy development was emphasis on an evidence-based approach to developing \\npolicy formulary and guiding interventions. A country migration pro˚le was developed during the formative \\nphase and a National Migration Health Research Commission was undertaken over a three-year period.  Efforts \\nwere made to undertake multidisciplinary research studies that were not only rigorous but adopted high \\nethical standards. The ˚ndings were shared though a series of National Symposiums on Migration Health \\nResearch, with the participation of government agencies, migrant community representatives, civil society, \\ndevelopment partners, United Nations agencies, the private sector and academia. \\n4. Adopt a pragmatic and responsive approach\\nAn important feature of the policy development process was the imperative placed on responding to any \\nnationally important migration and health challenges the country would encounter, rather than remain a \\nstatic process, only for purposes of policy formulation. The utility of an interministerial taskforce in taking \\npractical action was recognized. For example, a National Border Health Strategy was developed to enhance \\npoint-of-entry capacities to better prepare, respond to and mitigate global health security risks, and improve \\ndisease surveillance and coordination at points of entry.\\n5. Embed an accountability framework\\nTracking progress and sharing regular progress reports at the national, subnational and global levels is a key \\naspect of policy implementation. Sri Lanka formally reported progress made against the four intervention \\ndomains detailed in World Health Assembly resolution 61.17: Health of migrants, in 2010 and 2011. A \\nnational report card on migration and health was also developed by the MHTF, and can been read in full at \\n352www.migrationhealth.lk\\n. A recurrent challenge has been to sustain the coordination efforts both within the \\nMinistry of Health and between ministries and partners.\\n6. Ensure global health diplomacy and engagement\\nIn a globalized world, individual member States cannot ﬁdo it aloneﬂ in effectively advancing their national \\nmigration health agendas. Multilateral diplomatic efforts need to be made with both sending and receiving \\ncountries, recognizing that health vulnerabilities diffuse across all phases of migration and across borders. \\n353Appendix C. Health in the implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular \\nMigrationObjective 1: Collect and utilize accurate and disaggregated data as a basis for evidence-based policies \\nThe action on developing country-speci˚c migration pro˚les with disaggregated data in a national context \\nshould include health data to develop evidence-informed migration policies. This can begin with practical \\nplatforms for connecting research experts, scholars and policymakers globally to strengthen information \\nsystems to analyse trends in migrants™ health, disaggregate health information and facilitate the exchange \\nof lessons learned. \\nObjective 7: Address and reduce vulnerabilities in migration\\n The actions on addressing vulnerabilities in migration include provision of health care, and psychological \\nand other counselling services, in particular for migrant women, adolescents, and for unaccompanied and \\nseparated children across the stages of migration. This would also require addressing migrant experiences, \\nincluding xenophobia, migration restrictions for migrants with health needs, and other policy gaps and \\ninconsistencies, as well as efforts to enhance migrant resilience, through adequate information, education \\nand empowerment for self-help. \\nObjective 10: Prevent, combat and eradicate traf˚cking in persons in the context of international \\nmigration \\nProtection and assistance for traf˚cked persons will require integration of measures for physical and \\npsychological health, including service delivery and capacity development. This will require cross-border \\ncooperation and partnerships to harmonize intersectoral policies and practices, and ensure continuity of care \\nand health responses to particular health needs of women, men, girls and boys. \\nObjective 15: Provide access to basic services for migrants \\nThis objective encourages governments to ﬁincorporate the health needs of migrants in national and local \\nhealth care policies and plans, [...] including by taking into consideration relevant recommendations from \\nthe WHO Framework of Priorities and Guiding Principles to Promote the Health of Refugees and Migrantsﬂ,  \\nwhich were developed in collaboration with member States, IOM and other United Nations partners. These \\ncommitments are linked with governments™ plans for health-related SDG results (SDG 3 and others), including \\nstrengthening migrant-inclusive health-care systems.  \\nObjective 22: Establish mechanisms for the portability of social security entitlements and earned \\nbene˚ts \\nInclusion of health-related actions in this objective will require assessment and enhancement of ˚nancial \\nrisk protection in health services, to reduce the burden of catastrophic health expenditures on migrants. \\nSocial protection in health should be an integral component of reciprocal social security agreements on \\nthe portability of earned bene˚ts for migrant workers at all skill levels, for both long-term and temporary \\nmigration. \\n354Chapter 9Appendix A. Policy processes of significance for the governance of environmental migrationBeyond the UNFCC and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, environmental migration \\ncontinues to be discussed in various thematic policy processes. This includes but is not limited to, the United \\nNations Convention to Combat Deserti˚cation (UNCCD), the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, \\nthe Human Rights Council (HRC) and the work under the Of˚ce of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \\n(OHCHR), the discussions conducted by the tripartite constituents of the International Labour Organization \\n(ILO), the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \\n(UNHCR) Executive Committee as well as IOM governing body mechanisms.\\n29 All these global policy spaces \\nhave devoted speci˚c sessions to migration and displacement in the context of climate change, disaster and \\nenvironmental degradation. Other processes Œ such as the small island developing States focused SAMOA \\nPathway or dealing with key environmental issues such as oceans, ecosystems or water Œ are also incorporating \\nmigration issues. The infographic below summarizes the main elements of the various policy forums and \\nmechanisms.\\nOf particular note is the Platform on Disaster Displacement (PDD), which is a State-led initiative that seeks to \\nbring migration and environmental change together to address the protection gap for persons displaced across \\nborders, and in particular to implement the Nansen Protection Agenda adopted by 108 countries in 2015.\\n30 The PDD focuses primarily on displacement and also has a work plan aimed at increasing adaptive capacity of \\nall people who may move in relation to environmental stresses like disasters and climate change. For example, \\nthe PDD™s recently updated strategy promotes managing displacement risks through moving ﬁout of harm™s \\nway in a digni˚ed manner, through the creation of pathways for safe, orderly and regular migrationﬂ.\\n31 The \\nPDD™s work plan states that migration can be a response to disaster risk.\\n32 29\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30\\n\\n31\\n32\\n355\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMigration in adaptation\\nWork\\nprogramme\\nonLoss\\nandDamage\\ncreated\\n:paragraph\\n14(f)\\ncalls\\nforParties\\ntotake\\nﬁmeasures\\ntoenhance\\nunderstanding,\\ncoordination\\nand\\ncooperationwith\\nregard\\ntoclimate\\nchange\\ninduced\\ndisplacement,\\nmigration\\nandplanned\\nrelocation\\n,whereappropriate,\\natthe\\nnational,regionaland\\ninternationallevelsﬂ\\ntoenhance\\nactionon\\nadaptation\\n.Migration in loss and \\ndamage\\nCOP agreed on their role in addressing \\nloss and damage. \\nParagraph\\n7(vi\\n):ﬁadvance\\nthe\\nunderstanding\\nof\\nand\\nexpertiseon\\nloss\\nanddamage,\\nwhich\\nincludes...\\nhow\\nimpacts\\nof\\nclimate\\nchange\\nare\\naffecting\\npatternsof\\nmigration,displacementand\\nhuman\\nmobility\\n.ﬂCasablanca \\nTechnical \\nMeeting\\nWarsaw International \\nMechanism\\nfor\\nLoss\\nandDamage\\nassociatedwith\\nClimate\\nChange\\n(WIM)created,tohelpdeveloping\\ncountries\\nthatareparticularly\\nvulnerable,\\nwiththree\\npillars\\n:ŁEnhancingunderstanding\\n;ŁDialogue\\n,coordination,coherence,\\nand\\nsynergies\\n;and\\nŁAction\\nand\\nsupport\\nIOMorganizedatechnicalmeetingtodocumentbestpractices,challenges,andlessonsaswellastodeveloprecommendationsfortheTaskForceonDisplacementinrelationtothethreepillarsoftheW.Task Force on Displacement\\nThe\\nTask\\nForce\\nonDisplacement\\nestablished\\nunder\\ntheWIM\\ninthe\\nParis\\nAgreement\\n;created\\naclearing\\nhouse\\ntogather\\nand\\ndisseminate\\ninformation\\nrelatedto\\nrisk\\n.Migrants\\nacknowledged\\ninPreamble\\n.Paragraph\\n50:ﬁavert,\\nminimize\\nand\\naddressdisplacement\\nrelatedtothe\\nadverseimpacts\\nof\\nclimate\\nchangeﬂ\\nCOP of solutions\\nWIMreviewed\\nand\\na5-\\nyear\\nrolling\\nwork\\nplan\\napproved\\nbyCOP\\n.Ban\\nKi-Moon\\nand\\nFrançois\\nHollandehighlighted\\ntheimportanceof\\nhuman\\nmigration,and\\nover\\n20events\\nwere\\norganized\\ndedicatedto\\naddressing\\nhuman\\nmigration\\n.Launch of clearing \\nhouse\\nfor risk \\ntransfer\\nImplementationof \\nThe2-yearworkplanandstructureoftheWarsawInternationalMechanismwasapprovedbyCOPMigration in \\nknowledge\\ntransfer\\nFacilitationofknowledge\\ntransfer\\nand\\nbestpractices\\nrelatedtoloss\\nanddamage\\nTask Force on Displacement \\nRecommendations\\nﬁRecommendationsfromthereportof\\nthe\\nExcom\\n/WIM\\nonintegrated\\napproaches\\ntoaverting,\\nminimizing\\nand\\naddressing\\ndisplacementrelated\\ntothe\\nadverse\\nimpacts\\nofclimate\\nchange\\nﬂ,adopted\\nbythe\\nUNFCCC\\nParties\\ninDecision\\n10/CP\\n.24.TFD\\nStakeholder \\nMeeting\\nOnbehalf\\nofthe\\nTask\\nForce\\nonDisplacement,\\nIOM\\nand\\nPDD\\norganized\\nastakeholder\\nmeeting\\ntotake\\nstock\\nofprogress\\nunder\\nthe\\ndifferent\\nareas\\noftheTask\\nForce\\'s\\nworkplan\\nand\\ninform\\nthe\\ndevelopmentoftheintegratedrecommendationsthatpresented\\natCOP\\n24inKatowice,\\nPoland\\n.Source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n356National policy developmentsA 2018 mapping conducted under the Task Force on Displacement workplan highlights that national policies \\non migration on the one hand, and climate change on the other hand, increasingly consider environmental \\nmigration issues.\\n33 Out of 66 countries and territories reviewed, 53\\n per cent made reference to climate change \\nand environmental factors in their national migration and displacement frameworks. Out of 37 countries and \\nterritories having submitted national climate change adaptation policies, plans or strategies, 81\\n per cent \\nreferred to human mobility. \\nDifferent dimensions of human mobility are touched upon (migration, displacement and planned relocation), \\nthrough a variety of thematic lenses (such as security, urbanization, labour, adaptation and health). This \\ndemonstrates an increased level of integration of the environment-migration nexus in national policies, in \\nline with the greater awareness witnessed at the global level. However, gaps remain in terms of national \\npolicy coherence, although efforts are made to create synergies between climate/environmental and human \\nmobility communities.\\nThe full report is available at \\nhttps://environmentalmigration.iom.int/iom-pdd-task-force-displacement-\\nstakeholder-meeting\\n33\\n357Chapter 10Appendix A.

In addition, many \\nmigrant workers sending remittances back home had \\nlittle savings and no access to unemployment bene˚ts, \\nand were left with limited options to cope.\\nOn 22\\n 2016, three suicide bombings occurred in Brussels. The attacks hit a metro station and the \\nairport of a city with a population comprising over 60\\n of foreign-born residents and hosting tens of thousands foreign  and workers every day. 32 people were killed and some 350 injured in the \\nbombings.

The conflict has caused at least 200,000 victims \\nsince 2006, with many more people witnessing violence and violations of human rights. Criminal groups have also become increasingly involved in the migration business, as migrants transiting through Mexico cross areas under their \\ncontrol: they regulate schedules and trajectories of the flows and extort migrants and smugglers. Data show that no less than 10\\n of migrants are robbed or extorted money while in transit through the country, and many may also be kidnapped, abused or killed. Criminal violence\\nIn early 2014, the Ebola virus spread from Guinean \\nrural areas to cities, then to Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Convergence and divergence between the Global Compact for Migration and \\nprior global migration initiatives and processes \\nThe Global Compact for Migration builds on previous global migration initiatives and processes, including on \\nthematic areas upon which these initiatives were already converging prior to the Compact. These areas of \\nconvergence are reproduced in the table below along three main thematic clusters: (a) minimizing the negative \\naspects of migration by addressing the drivers and consequences of displacement and irregular migration; \\n(b) acknowledging and strengthening the positive effects of migration; and (c) protecting migrants™ rights \\nand ensuring their well-being.\\nThe Global Compact for Migration also con˚rms thematic trends that have emerged through the years \\nraising new migratory and policy challenges, such as environmental migration and the focus on sustainable \\ndevelopment, as outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (see table below). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n364\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nŁ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource:\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, if the Global Compact for Migration covers issues that were already ranking high on the global \\nmigration governance agenda before the adoption of the Compact, it also goes beyond previous endeavours \\nby: \\nŁ Placing more emphasis on some speci˚c thematic areas, including on:  \\n ŒCollecting and utilizing accurate and disaggregated data (Objective 1) to ﬁfoster [–] research, \\nguide[–] coherent and evidence-based policy-making and well-informed public discourse [–]ﬂ and \\nfacilitate the effective monitoring and evaluation of the Compact™s commitments.\\n365 ŒEnhancing the availability and ˜exibility of pathways for regular migration (Objective 5), especially \\nthrough labour migration and skills matching at all skills levels,\\n35 in addition to family reuni˚cation \\nand academic mobility.\\n36 Regular avenues are also considered for migrants compelled to leave \\nbecause of sudden-onset natural disasters and other precarious situations by providing, for instance, \\nhumanitarian visas, private sponsorships, access to education for children and temporary work \\npermits.\\n37 It provides as well for planned relocation and visa options in the speci˚c cases of slow-\\nonset natural disasters, the adverse effects of climate change and environmental degradation.\\n38 ŒAddressing and reducing vulnerabilities in migration (Objective 7), covering a broad illustrative list \\nof migrants in a situation of vulnerability, regardless of migration status.\\n39Ł Introducing one thematic area which was not covered in previous global migration initiatives: \\n ŒSaving lives and establishing coordinated international efforts on missing migrants (Objective 8), \\nnevertheless already re˜ected in the 2016 New York Declaration.\\n40While these developments constitute steps forward in global migration governance, some Global Compact for \\nMigration objectives, commitments and actions appear not to be as far-reaching as one would have expected. \\nIf one compares the ˚nal text of the Global Compact for Migration with its ˚rst draft,\\n41 some issues seem \\nto have been more delicate during States™ negotiations. This is, for instance, the case of the detention of \\nmigrant children. The ˚rst draft referred in categorical terms to ﬁending the practice of child detention in \\nthe context of international migrationﬂ,\\n42 while States have only committed to ﬁworking to end the practice \\nof child detentionﬂ in the ˚nal text of the Compact.\\n43 Similarly, two speci˚c issues have not been included \\nin the ˚nal text of the Compact: \\nThe non-criminalization of irregular migration: Instead, the Global Compact for Migration provides for \\npotential sanctions to address irregular entry or stay without expressly prohibiting criminal ones,\\n44 except \\nfor smuggled and traf˚cked migrants.\\n45 The regularization of undocumented migrants: Regularization is only indirectly envisaged by ﬁfacilitat[ing] \\naccess for migrants in an irregular status to an individual assessment that may lead to regular status, on a \\ncase by case basis and with clear and transparent criteriaﬂ.\\n46 35\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n42\\n\\n\\n43\\n\\n44\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n45\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n367References* \\nChapter 1AlSayyad, N. and M.
